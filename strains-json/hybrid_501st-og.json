Here are five of the latest and most popular submissions we received. If you have tried any of the newest strains in the Leafly Strain Explorer, make sure to rate and review them. You can also check to see which ones are available near you by clicking the “Availability” tab on our website and app. Get out there and find the newest varieties of cannabis in the Leafly database to try!\n\n1. Super Cheese\nCharacteristics of Super Cheese:\n\nSuper Cheese, bred by Positronics, is a throwback to the old school strains that filled the coffee shops of Amsterdam in the late 1980s. Super Cheese was created through inbreeding, crossing Cheese genetics with another select phenotype believed to be Exodus Cheese. The aroma of this indica-dominant hybrid is a mix of skunky musk and a pungent blue cheese funk that has become synonymous with Cheese varieties. The flavor is a strong, smooth blend of bittersweet herbs and cream, like an earthy buttermilk.\n\n\n2. 1024\nCharacteristics of 1024:\n\n1024 is a sativa-dominant hybrid bred in Spain by Medical Seeds Co. The breeders claim to guard the secret genetics due to security reasons, but regardless of its genetic heritage, 1024 is a THC powerhouse with a sweet and spicy bouquet. Subtle fruit flavors mix with an herbal musk to produce uplifting sativa effects. One specific phenotype is noted for having a pungent odor that fills a room, similar to burning incense.\n\n\n3. 501st OG\nCharacteristics of 501st OG:\n\n501st OG, bred by Rare Dankness, is an indica-dominant hybrid that crosses Skywalker OG with Rare Dankness #1. The colorful flowers are tinged with a wide spectrum of green, blue, red, and purple hues that give off a deep piney Kush aroma that mixes with the sweetness of grape flavors. The potent indica effects make 501st OG a great nighttime strain to help with pain relief and trouble sleeping.\n\n\n4. Blueberry Essence\nCharacteristics of Blueberry Essence:\n\nBlueberry Essence is a high-CBD cannabis strain bred by Life Gardens in Washington. The undisclosed genetics produce purple buds that come with a mellow, fruity aroma and an earthy aftertaste that entices medical marijuana patients with its ability to combat an array of symptoms and conditions. Blueberry Essence relaxes away pain with a tingly sensation that reverberates throughout your extremities, providing a calming sense of bliss that eventually levels off to help induce sleep.\n\n\n5. Burkle\nCharacteristics of Burkle:\n\nBurkle is an indica-dominant hybrid that crosses Pre-98 Bubba Kush with Granddaddy Purple (though some claim it to be Purple Urkle based on the name). The result is a powerfully relaxing indica that consumes the body with calming effects that ease away pain and induce sleep. Burkle is great for a lazy evening at home, but not so great for being productive. Its sweet flavor profile is a blend of spiced licorice aromas and an earthy peppermint aftertaste. This strain is known to produce a case of the munchies which makes it a good choice for those suffering from a lack of an appetite.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12001911/new-strain-alert-super-cheese-1024-501st-og-blueberry-essence-and.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strain-alert-super-cheese-1024-501st-og-blueberry-essence-and"}],"reviewCount":97,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":42.994505494505496},{"name":"Sweet","score":31.73076923076923},{"name":"Grape","score":30.769230769230766},{"name":"Pine","score":24.725274725274726},{"name":"Pungent","score":24.450549450549453}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":107.28021978021978},{"name":"Euphoric","score":68.269230769230774},{"name":"Happy","score":65.521978021978029},{"name":"Sleepy","score":50.549450549450555},{"name":"Uplifted","score":44.780219780219781}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":36.401098901098905},{"name":"Pain","score":34.890109890109891},{"name":"Insomnia","score":24.725274725274726},{"name":"Depression","score":19.91758241758242},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":18.818681318681318}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":39.560439560439562},{"name":"PTSD","score":24.450549450549453},{"name":"Hypertension","score":16.895604395604394},{"name":"Migraines","score":12.912087912087912},{"name":"Arthritis","score":9.0659340659340657}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":27.609890109890109},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":19.368131868131869},{"name":"Headache","score":4.3956043956043951},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.0604395604395602},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.5494505494505495}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/501st-og/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/501st-og/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_1ae9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/599210/b/501st-og__primary_a575.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_47bc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/507857/b/501st-og__primary_af6c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_76b3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/465259/b/501st-og__primary_feeb.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_1700.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/444330/b/501st-og__primary_54a1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_c3dd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/443349/b/501st-og__primary_bace.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_d4b7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/412112/b/501st-og__primary_5742.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":12,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Denver, CO","Everett, WA","Tucson, AZ","De Beque, CO","Lincoln City, OR","Lynnwood, WA","Spokane, WA","Tacoma, WA","Ann Arbor, MI"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/501st-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.54639175257732/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Skywalker OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"skywalker-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skywalker-og","symbol":"Sko","applink":"leafly://strain/skywalker-og"},{"name":"Rare Dankness #1","subtitle":null,"slug":"rare-dankness-1","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/rare-dankness-1","symbol":"Rd1","applink":"leafly://strain/rare-dankness-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Super Cheese\nCharacteristics of Super Cheese:\n\nSuper Cheese, bred by Positronics, is a throwback to the old school strains that filled the coffee shops of Amsterdam in the late 1980s. Super Cheese was created through inbreeding, crossing Cheese genetics with another select phenotype believed to be Exodus Cheese. The aroma of this indica-dominant hybrid is a mix of skunky musk and a pungent blue cheese funk that has become synonymous with Cheese varieties. The flavor is a strong, smooth blend of bittersweet herbs and cream, like an earthy buttermilk.\n\n\n2. 1024\nCharacteristics of 1024:\n\n1024 is a sativa-dominant hybrid bred in Spain by Medical Seeds Co. The breeders claim to guard the secret genetics due to security reasons, but regardless of its genetic heritage, 1024 is a THC powerhouse with a sweet and spicy bouquet. Subtle fruit flavors mix with an herbal musk to produce uplifting sativa effects. One specific phenotype is noted for having a pungent odor that fills a room, similar to burning incense.\n\n\n3. 501st OG\nCharacteristics of 501st OG:\n\n501st OG, bred by Rare Dankness, is an indica-dominant hybrid that crosses Skywalker OG with Rare Dankness #1. The colorful flowers are tinged with a wide spectrum of green, blue, red, and purple hues that give off a deep piney Kush aroma that mixes with the sweetness of grape flavors. The potent indica effects make 501st OG a great nighttime strain to help with pain relief and trouble sleeping.\n\n\n4. Blueberry Essence\nCharacteristics of Blueberry Essence:\n\nBlueberry Essence is a high-CBD cannabis strain bred by Life Gardens in Washington. The undisclosed genetics produce purple buds that come with a mellow, fruity aroma and an earthy aftertaste that entices medical marijuana patients with its ability to combat an array of symptoms and conditions. Blueberry Essence relaxes away pain with a tingly sensation that reverberates throughout your extremities, providing a calming sense of bliss that eventually levels off to help induce sleep.\n\n\n5. Burkle\nCharacteristics of Burkle:\n\nBurkle is an indica-dominant hybrid that crosses Pre-98 Bubba Kush with Granddaddy Purple (though some claim it to be Purple Urkle based on the name). The result is a powerfully relaxing indica that consumes the body with calming effects that ease away pain and induce sleep. Burkle is great for a lazy evening at home, but not so great for being productive. Its sweet flavor profile is a blend of spiced licorice aromas and an earthy peppermint aftertaste. This strain is known to produce a case of the munchies which makes it a good choice for those suffering from a lack of an appetite.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12001911/new-strain-alert-super-cheese-1024-501st-og-blueberry-essence-and.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strain-alert-super-cheese-1024-501st-og-blueberry-essence-and"}],"reviewCount":97,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":42.994505494505496},{"name":"Sweet","score":31.73076923076923},{"name":"Grape","score":30.769230769230766},{"name":"Pine","score":24.725274725274726},{"name":"Pungent","score":24.450549450549453}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":107.28021978021978},{"name":"Euphoric","score":68.269230769230774},{"name":"Happy","score":65.521978021978029},{"name":"Sleepy","score":50.549450549450555},{"name":"Uplifted","score":44.780219780219781}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":36.401098901098905},{"name":"Pain","score":34.890109890109891},{"name":"Insomnia","score":24.725274725274726},{"name":"Depression","score":19.91758241758242},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":18.818681318681318}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":39.560439560439562},{"name":"PTSD","score":24.450549450549453},{"name":"Hypertension","score":16.895604395604394},{"name":"Migraines","score":12.912087912087912},{"name":"Arthritis","score":9.0659340659340657}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":27.609890109890109},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":19.368131868131869},{"name":"Headache","score":4.3956043956043951},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.0604395604395602},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.5494505494505495}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/501st-og/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/501st-og/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_1ae9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/599210/b/501st-og__primary_a575.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_47bc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/507857/b/501st-og__primary_af6c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_76b3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/465259/b/501st-og__primary_feeb.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_1700.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/444330/b/501st-og__primary_54a1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_c3dd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/443349/b/501st-og__primary_bace.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/501st-og_100x100_d4b7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/412112/b/501st-og__primary_5742.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":12,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Denver, CO","Everett, WA","Tucson, AZ","De Beque, CO","Lincoln City, OR","Lynnwood, WA","Spokane, WA","Tacoma, WA","Ann Arbor, MI"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/501st-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.54639175257732/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Skywalker OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"skywalker-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skywalker-og","symbol":"Sko","applink":"leafly://strain/skywalker-og"},{"name":"Rare Dankness #1","subtitle":null,"slug":"rare-dankness-1","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/rare-dankness-1","symbol":"Rd1","applink":"leafly://strain/rare-dankness-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
