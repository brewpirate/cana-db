Every one fell in love until many strains faded away due to the ridiculous demand for \"da widz\"\n\nEven today if you go to the Big Island and say:\n\n\"Got Widz?\"\n\nyou will be treated to\nthe finest most potent\nhashy yet smooth\ntropical mind warping\nflavors you have ever encountered,\n\n'98 Aloha White Widow is truly one\nof the most legendary cuts of all time!!!!",
