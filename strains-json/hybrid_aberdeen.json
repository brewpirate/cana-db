He came to my bedside and introduced himself to me. He wasn\u2019t like the other llamas he was kind and gentle. Next thing I know after one thing led to another I was on his back and we were galloping through the red wood forest. We were headed for battle. I\u2019m going to leave the story there. All I can say is that this strain is great. Highly recommend",
