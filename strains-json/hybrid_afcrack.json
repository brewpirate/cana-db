New spins on classic genetics means nothing ever gets stale, whether you\u0027re looking for a indica twist on the high-energy Green Crack or a three-way cross between three sativa favorites. Check out those and more below, and leave reviews for any you\u0027ve tried!\n¬†\n¬†¬†1. Afcrack\n\nAfcrack is a cross between two well-known clone-only strains, Afgoo and the Skunk #1 descendant Green Crack. Not much is known about this hybrid, but some experiential reports describe it as a smooth and tasty smoke with a predominantly indica-like high.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†2. Purple Bubba\n\nPurple Bubba is a cross of two well-known indica strains, Bubba Kush and Purple Kush. Given these potent genetics, you can be sure that a few puffs of this smooth and fruity tasting strain will leave you stuck to your chair with an intense body high. According to reports, Purple Bubba can be beneficial for patients suffering from chronic pain, loss of appetite, anxiety, and insomnia.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†3. Blueberry AK\n\nAs the name suggests, Blueberry AK is a hybrid strain that combines the indica-dominant Blueberry with the sativa-dominant AK-47, both popular and potent strains in their own right. Blueberry AK has a strong musky odor with undertones of berry, and flavors ranging from sweet Kush to the more peppery taste of the AK. The effects of this hybrid are both relaxing and upbeat, often inducing a case of the giggles, and people have used it to treat anxiety, depression, and pain.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†4. Strawberry Durban Diesel\n\nLoud Seeds recreated a hybrid they originally made years ago by crossing a Strawberry Cough x Durban Poison female with their Sour dominant Original Loud male. The result is Strawberry Durban Diesel, an 80% sativa-dominant plant that finishes flowering in 8-10 weeks and can produce THC levels up to 25%.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†5. Purple Aurora\n\nNew from breeders Alaska Built, Purple Aurora is a 60% indica, 35% sativa, 5% ruderalis auto-flowering hybrid resulting from a cross of Purple Kush and Purple Auto. This compact plant is well suited for outdoor grows in short-season northern climates, and produces tight flowers with significant levels of CBD and flavors ranging from overripe berries to earth and spicy fruit.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†6. Supergirl\n\nNirvana Seeds created Supergirl by backcrossing the famous Skunk #1 and focusing on the indica portion of that strain‚Äôs genetics. This 80% indica produces large rock-hard buds, tons of resin, and a strong, skunky and coffee odor. Although containing a relatively mild THC content between 8% and 15%, the high is fast and hard-hitting, leaving the user fully relaxed and unable to focus. A good choice for treating insomnia, Supergirl has sedating effects that help your eyes ease shut.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†7. Cloud 9\n\nCloud 9 began as a collaboration between Kiwiseeds and Dampkring Classics as an attempt to stabilize the classic clone-only strain NYC Diesel. By adding the genetics of the indica hybrid Milky Way, Cloud 9 was created. The best phenotypes are longer flowering than the original, but possess amazing flavors and potency. Take note not to confuse this hybrid with Dinafem‚Äôs Cloud #9.\n\n¬†\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12001917/new-strains-alert-afcrack-purple-bubba-blueberry-ak-cloud-9-and-m.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-afcrack-purple-bubba-blueberry-ak-cloud-9-and-m"}],"reviewCount":10,"flavors":[{"name":"Flowery","score":106.81818181818181},{"name":"Earthy","score":106.81818181818181},{"name":"Sage","score":102.27272727272727},{"name":"Citrus","score":102.27272727272727},{"name":"Lemon","score":102.27272727272727}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":109.09090909090909},{"name":"Relaxed","score":109.09090909090909},{"name":"Tingly","score":36.36363636363636},{"name":"Creative","score":34.090909090909093},{"name":"Sleepy","score":29.545454545454547}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Fatigue","score":102.27272727272727},{"name":"Stress","score":31.818181818181817},{"name":"Depression","score":6.8181818181818175},{"name":"Headaches","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Pain","score":4.5454545454545459}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"PTSD","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Arthritis","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Migraines","score":2.2727272727272729}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":104.54545454545455},{"name":"Anxious","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.2727272727272729}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/afcrack_100x100_c6b7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/497744/b/afcrack__primary_45c5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/afcrack_100x100_950e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/485176/b/afcrack__primary_7461.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/afcrack_100x100_cf66.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/485398/b/afcrack__primary_cf39.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":3,"popularCities":["Bellevue, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/afcrack","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3.5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afgoo","subtitle":null,"slug":"afgoo","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afgoo","symbol":"Afo","applink":"leafly://strain/afgoo"},{"name":"Green Crack","subtitle":null,"slug":"green-crack","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/green-crack","symbol":"Gc","applink":"leafly://strain/green-crack"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Blueberry AK has a strong musky odor with undertones of berry, and flavors ranging from sweet Kush to the more peppery taste of the AK. The effects of this hybrid are both relaxing and upbeat, often inducing a case of the giggles, and people have used it to treat anxiety, depression, and pain.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†4. Strawberry Durban Diesel\n\nLoud Seeds recreated a hybrid they originally made years ago by crossing a Strawberry Cough x Durban Poison female with their Sour dominant Original Loud male. The result is Strawberry Durban Diesel, an 80% sativa-dominant plant that finishes flowering in 8-10 weeks and can produce THC levels up to 25%.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†5. Purple Aurora\n\nNew from breeders Alaska Built, Purple Aurora is a 60% indica, 35% sativa, 5% ruderalis auto-flowering hybrid resulting from a cross of Purple Kush and Purple Auto. This compact plant is well suited for outdoor grows in short-season northern climates, and produces tight flowers with significant levels of CBD and flavors ranging from overripe berries to earth and spicy fruit.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†6. Supergirl\n\nNirvana Seeds created Supergirl by backcrossing the famous Skunk #1 and focusing on the indica portion of that strain‚Äôs genetics. This 80% indica produces large rock-hard buds, tons of resin, and a strong, skunky and coffee odor. Although containing a relatively mild THC content between 8% and 15%, the high is fast and hard-hitting, leaving the user fully relaxed and unable to focus. A good choice for treating insomnia, Supergirl has sedating effects that help your eyes ease shut.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†7. Cloud 9\n\nCloud 9 began as a collaboration between Kiwiseeds and Dampkring Classics as an attempt to stabilize the classic clone-only strain NYC Diesel. By adding the genetics of the indica hybrid Milky Way, Cloud 9 was created. The best phenotypes are longer flowering than the original, but possess amazing flavors and potency. Take note not to confuse this hybrid with Dinafem‚Äôs Cloud #9.\n\n¬†\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12001917/new-strains-alert-afcrack-purple-bubba-blueberry-ak-cloud-9-and-m.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-afcrack-purple-bubba-blueberry-ak-cloud-9-and-m"}],"reviewCount":10,"flavors":[{"name":"Flowery","score":106.81818181818181},{"name":"Earthy","score":106.81818181818181},{"name":"Sage","score":102.27272727272727},{"name":"Citrus","score":102.27272727272727},{"name":"Lemon","score":102.27272727272727}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":109.09090909090909},{"name":"Relaxed","score":109.09090909090909},{"name":"Tingly","score":36.36363636363636},{"name":"Creative","score":34.090909090909093},{"name":"Sleepy","score":29.545454545454547}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Fatigue","score":102.27272727272727},{"name":"Stress","score":31.818181818181817},{"name":"Depression","score":6.8181818181818175},{"name":"Headaches","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Pain","score":4.5454545454545459}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"PTSD","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Arthritis","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Migraines","score":2.2727272727272729}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":104.54545454545455},{"name":"Anxious","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.2727272727272729}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/afcrack_100x100_c6b7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/497744/b/afcrack__primary_45c5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/afcrack_100x100_950e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/485176/b/afcrack__primary_7461.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/afcrack_100x100_cf66.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/485398/b/afcrack__primary_cf39.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":3,"popularCities":["Bellevue, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/afcrack","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3.5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afgoo","subtitle":null,"slug":"afgoo","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afgoo","symbol":"Afo","applink":"leafly://strain/afgoo"},{"name":"Green Crack","subtitle":null,"slug":"green-crack","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/green-crack","symbol":"Gc","applink":"leafly://strain/green-crack"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
