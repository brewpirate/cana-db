Every time I smoke Afghan widow my dick gets hard and my asshole gapes as it rapes my mind and body. The body high was once so intense I came, shat, and threw up at the same time. I get high just from smelling this bud. One month ago my dog ate one of my nugs and he is still sleeping. The first time I ever smoked this strain everything started to change color. This weed is better than sex and is more intense than heroin. Nothing is harder than my dick rn just thinking about this strain. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",
