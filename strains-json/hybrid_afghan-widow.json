I love how the floral bouquet opens up inside of that wonderful, piney aroma. This has produced a nice, happy high. It finishes with a fantastic throat coat - heck, this stuff even makes my bong happy.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/ZtQxS6XT_MjOwMadRkRsU9ZNU-I=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fX2q7eTOS7WxMAnwrLSBM_wide-brim-green.png"},{"id":1631671,"username":"TannerFair","text":"This strain is super dank it smells like my daughter did when she got sprayed by a dank ass skunk, I might have to bathe the bud In tomato juice. Every time I smoke Afghan widow my dick gets hard and my asshole gapes as it rapes my mind and body. The body high was once so intense I came, shat, and threw up at the same time. I get high just from smelling this bud. One month ago my dog ate one of my nugs and he is still sleeping. The first time I ever smoked this strain everything started to change color. This weed is better than sex and is more intense than heroin. Nothing is harder than my dick rn just thinking about this strain. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":8,"flavors":[{"name":"Diesel","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Pungent","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Skunk","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Ammonia","score":100},{"name":"Blue Cheese","score":100}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":105.76923076923077},{"name":"Sleepy","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Tingly","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Aroused","score":100},{"name":"Creative","score":5.7692307692307692}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":1.9230769230769231},{"name":"Fatigue","score":1.9230769230769231},{"name":"Insomnia","score":1.9230769230769231}],"conditions":[],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":5.7692307692307692},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.8461538461538463}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/afghan-widow_100x100_d552.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/524461/b/afghan-widow__primary_24c1.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-widow","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afghan Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghan-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghan-kush","symbol":"Afk","applink":"leafly://strain/afghan-kush"},{"name":"White Widow","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-widow","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow","symbol":"Ww","applink":"leafly://strain/white-widow"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
