    "description": "<p>Afpak, named for its direct <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani\">Afghani</a> and Pakistani landrace heritage, is a beautiful indica-dominant hybrid with light green and deep bluish purple leaves. The taste and aroma are floral with a touch of lemon, making the inhale light and smooth. Its effects start in the stomach by activating the appetite. There is also a potent relaxation that starts in the head and face, and gradually sinks down into the body. Enjoy this strain if you&rsquo;re suffering from stress, mild physical discomfort, or having difficulty eating. &nbsp;</p>\n",
