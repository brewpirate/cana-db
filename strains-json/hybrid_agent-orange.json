You\u0027re thinking deep thoughts and laughing about it, all the while riding on a magic carpet ride that is your body. Great for dulling pain.\r\n\r\nThis was the first thing I smoked after not smoking for 1.5 months, and it was just what I wanted. Recommended if you want the best of both indica and sativa worlds.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1642612,"username":"Bugzbunni","text":"I’ve had this app for a while now and I’ve never wanted to write a review except for NOW.

This is a lot smoother than fortune cookies and sour power pack. If you like granddaddy purple this is it’s exciting opposite. Love love love it.

The new season not only inspires a change in wardrobe, but often a change in our stash boxes. These cannabis strains and products are known to fuel the cozy feels as the days get darker, leaves turn, and rain speckles the sidewalks outside. So load up, snuggle up, and smoke up, because fall is finally here.\n1. Jack Herer\n(Leafly)\nSativa-dominant Jack Herer is a strain for all seasons, but this sweet, pine-scented bud is especially well-suited for autumn. The warm, spicy flavor fills the body with a comfy, cozy sensation throughout every limb while wrapping the mind in a blissful blanket. And for those mourning the loss of long summer days, Jack Herer offers a comforting hand to help pull you from low moods.\n\n2. Infused Syrups\n(Courtesy of Craft Elixirs)\nWhat’s better than a hot drink on a windy fall morning? Cannabis-infused hot drinks, obviously. Infused syrups are hitting the market with ferocity, blessing our mugs with the gift of enhanced flavor and effect. Add Craft Elixirs’ CBD Ginger to your green tea for feelings of clean relaxation that lets you stay productive and stress-free, or find an infused maple syrup to add to your morning latte. Or, simply make infused syrup yourself by following this recipe.\n\n3. Agent Orange\n(Leafly)\nWith an invigorating citrus flavor that warms both mind and body, Agent Orange is a versatile hybrid strain that perfectly accompanies hobbies both relaxing and active. Take Agent Orange out on an autumn hike and watch as its euphoric veil enhances the red, yellow, and orange colors around you. Puff on this one while stuck inside on a rainy day, giving yourself permission to relax with some video games or a new show. Agent Orange also brings out the best flavors in chai tea, a hot toddy, or a cinnamon hot chocolate.\n\n4. Pre-Rolled Joints\n\nFew pleasures match the feeling of walking through an orange-hued forest with a joint in-hand. Whether you never learned how to roll a joint or feel pressured to spend every available second appreciating the fleeting colors of fall, pre-rolls make a convenient mobile choice. Numerous pre-roll options await you, but my favorite remains the Saints variety pack from Seattle Green Bud. (More Leafly staff favorites can be found here.)\n\n5. Vanilla Kush\n(Leafly)\nVanilla Kush is a cozy indica staple that delivers autumn vibes with a toasty vanilla flavor that sits underneath warm, earthy overtones. Bringing a gentle euphoric hum to the mind while letting muscles sink like dead weight into blankets, use this indica to cozy up with a book or movie, or let it guide you into a well-deserved nap on a rainy weekend.\n\n6. Infused Bath Bombs\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\nAs temperatures drop outside, the urge to dip into a steaming bathtub gets hard to fight. Light a few candles, turn on some relaxing music, and sink into a hot spring sizzling with cannabis. You can take a lovely cannabis-infused bath thanks to magical bath soaks like those from Cannabis Basics, Mary Jane’s Medicinals, and other favorites. Does your local dispensary not carry bath products? Just make your own bath bombs with this recipe.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21132857/fall-strains-and-products.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/cannabis-products-for-fall-september-2017"},{"id":"contentitems-32171","title":"Tips for Growing Agent Orange Cannabis","author":"Leafly Staff","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1498410049000)\/","text":"Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and General Hydroponics are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Agent Orange offers a quality, uplifting high and a powerful citrus aroma that allows the mind and body to relax. A cross of Orange Velvet and Jack the Ripper, Agent Orange was produced by Subcool at TGA Genetics.\nGrow Techniques: Top and train heavily to help this plant produce a bushy shape. The more leads you can get, the higher your yields. It grows well in all mediums, but thrives in big pots in outdoor Northern California. Make sure the buds are supported; otherwise they’ll break the branches.\nFlowering Time: 7-9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: This plant does best if kept between 68-80 degrees Fahrenheit. Agent Orange does great in the California sun, especially with warm nights.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Agent Orange will take off outdoors and grow into beautiful large plants. It also trains well indoors, either hydroponically or in soil.\nFeeding: When growing in soil, have your giant pots amended and filled with nutrients long before your plants go in the ground. Strive for a healthy mixture of chicken manure, worm castings, perlite, and other quality soil amenders.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24132635/agent-orange-cannabis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-agent-orange-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":1008,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":53.003988397389413},{"name":"Orange","score":43.194343727338648},{"name":"Sweet","score":20.294295383127871},{"name":"Pungent","score":9.1237611795987448},{"name":"Earthy","score":8.6421319796954315}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":73.491056321005559},{"name":"Uplifted","score":56.08714043993232},{"name":"Euphoric","score":52.712714527435338},{"name":"Relaxed","score":49.91660623640319},{"name":"Energetic","score":42.794899685762623}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":25.134759487551367},{"name":"Stress","score":21.826806864877931},{"name":"Pain","score":16.600797679477882},{"name":"Insomnia","score":13.202803964225282},{"name":"Fatigue","score":11.421924099589074}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":27.994319555233261},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":13.938240270727579},{"name":"PTSD","score":13.097051003142372},{"name":"Migraines","score":5.87200870195794},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":4.3938844573362346}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":28.161107082426877},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":12.474619289340101},{"name":"Anxious","score":9.1001933768431229},{"name":"Headache","score":7.3990814599951653},{"name":"Dizzy","score":6.623761179598743}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/agent-orange/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/agent-orange/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/agent-orange_100x100_a2b1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000829/b/agent-orange__primary_ea49.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/agent-orange_100x100_967a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/707957/b/agent-orange__primary_374b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/agent-orange_100x100_773a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/672493/b/agent-orange__primary_f69c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/agent-orange_100x100_a023.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/670447/b/agent-orange__primary_5ea2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/agent-orange_100x100_5482.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/649066/b/agent-orange__primary_3f6f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/agent-orange_100x100_d4e5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/646988/b/agent-orange__primary_9f3d.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":244,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Seattle, WA","Los Angeles, CA","Salem, OR","Eugene, OR","Everett, WA","San Francisco, CA","Calgary, AB","China","Medford, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/agent-orange","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.20238095238095/240","testGraph":"https://leafly.s3.amazonaws.com/strains/testing/aLeQ25WkTIaxWvJzewIi_agent-orange.png","weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Orange Velvet","subtitle":null,"slug":"orange-velvet","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet","symbol":"Ov","applink":"leafly://strain/orange-velvet"},{"name":"Jack the Ripper","subtitle":null,"slug":"jack-the-ripper","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/jack-the-ripper","symbol":"Jtr","applink":"leafly://strain/jack-the-ripper"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":55,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
