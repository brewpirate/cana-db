Leafly and\u00a0General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Created in 1992 by Serious Seeds, AK-47 is a hybrid strain that delivers a powerful high. It has won several awards and has been used by breeders for the development of many other popular strains. It flowers quickly and offers high yields that radiate with sweet, pungent aromas.\nGrow Techniques: Grow indoors in either hydroponic or soil mediums to get the best results. A great strain for SOG (sea of green), create an even canopy by topping and pruning your plants while training them through trellising. Be aware that AK-47 is known to be especially pungent, so make sure your air filtration system is running properly and effectively.\u00a0\nFlowering Time: 7 to 8 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Mild and dry climate between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: AK-47 does best indoors where humidity can be regulated. Its large dense buds are prone to bud rot, making outdoor gardens a challenging environment.\nFeeding: Big buds mean lots of feeding during flowering. Keep phosphorus levels up and pay attention to bud development so you have time to flush your plants completely before harvest.",
