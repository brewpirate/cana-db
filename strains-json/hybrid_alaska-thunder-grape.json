Some of the most beautiful bud ive ever seen. My man said he could only spare a q but it came as 2 thick crown nugs. For some reason he doesnt like the crowns. The trich coverage is top 3 ive seen, the bud is actually green but so covered it looks white.\nSmell/Taste: The combo of ATFs sweet peppery flavor with grape apes sweet n sour grape fuses into a delicious warm grapey/strawberry flavor with hints of pepper that almost seem to pop in your sinus cavity. I cant explain the feeling, its like a car exhaust is backfireing delicious peppery terpenes while the grapeyness is steady. Really F\u0027n amazing.\nEffects: This stuff really creeps, your high from the 1st hit, but it keeps coming in waves and takes about 15mins to fully kick in. It starts with a headband feeling, then your eyes widen as it sinks down your back. Everything seems brighter, by the time it kicks in you have a very balanced high that kills pain, uplifts and helps focus and creativity all with a great euphporic buzz. If you over do it, it quickly turns into couchlock and a dazed feeling that lasts for up to 6hrs. Best to take a few hits, wait a little and do again, i made the mistake of smoking a bubbler then a 1g blunt and i was tapped out for about 8hrs.\nDefinetly a great strain. I hope NJ gets to savor more of this.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1477861,"username":"Guamanian78","text":"I am going through the rigorous process of acquiring a Medical Marijuana Card and just wanted to do some research on the variety of strains.
