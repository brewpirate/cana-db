            "text": "Alaskan Thunder Grape (also know as Grape Thunder)\nLooks: White and purple buds with a fair amount of red hairs and bright green leaves here and there. Some of the most beautiful bud ive ever seen. My man said he could only spare a q but it came as 2 thick crown nugs. For some reason he doesnt like the crowns. The trich coverage is top 3 ive seen, the bud is actually green but so covered it looks white.\nSmell/Taste: The combo of ATFs sweet peppery flavor with grape apes sweet n sour grape fuses into a delicious warm grapey/strawberry flavor with hints of pepper that almost seem to pop in your sinus cavity. I cant explain the feeling, its like a car exhaust is backfireing delicious peppery terpenes while the grapeyness is steady. Really F'n amazing.\nEffects: This stuff really creeps, your high from the 1st hit, but it keeps coming in waves and takes about 15mins to fully kick in. It starts with a headband feeling, then your eyes widen as it sinks down your back. Everything seems brighter, by the time it kicks in you have a very balanced high that kills pain, uplifts and helps focus and creativity all with a great euphporic buzz. If you over do it, it quickly turns into couchlock and a dazed feeling that lasts for up to 6hrs. Best to take a few hits, wait a little and do again, i made the mistake of smoking a bubbler then a 1g blunt and i was tapped out for about 8hrs.\nDefinetly a great strain. I hope NJ gets to savor more of this.",

And this one in particular happened to catch my eye as it suggests in helping with eye pressure and has nearly no negative response. But with time and trial and error along with keeping record of use time and dates as well as method and type of strain most people can formulate a medicinal regimen that works with their diagnoses.",
