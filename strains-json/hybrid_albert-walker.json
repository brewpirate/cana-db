    "description": "<p>Albert Walker is an indica-dominant hybrid with unknown origins, but is thought to have descended from <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-skunk\">Afghan Skunk</a> and bred in the Pacific Northwest. Evidence of its lineage is found in its sour lemon and skunky smell and heavy full-body effects that can last for several hours. Albert Walker&rsquo;s euphoric and relaxing qualities make it a go-to strain for patients treating depression and anxiety, and may also have benefits for chronic pain and appetite loss. This clone-only strain may come as a challenge for some growers as the plants tend to require frequent attention and maintenance. However, the high yields following its 8-week flowering cycle could be considered a satisfactory reward.</p>\n",
