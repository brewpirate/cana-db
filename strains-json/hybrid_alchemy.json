The celebration was sponsored by Leafly and showcased some of the region’s best cannabis flower, concentrates, edibles, topicals, glass artists, and accessories. Even a last-minute venue change couldn’t stop the stream of cannabis lovers from overflowing the state fair-themed event that came complete with infused cotton candy, a mechanical joint to ride, magicians, performers, artists, and more. Honestly, the only thing missing was a medicated corn dog to combat my munchies.\nAs expected, the dab bar was the hive that everyone was buzzing around, with a variety of solvent and solventless concentrates to sample from some of the best extract artists in the area. The highlight had to be local artist Scott Deppe’s crystal skull piece that sat at the X-Tracted bar and captured every passer-by with its intricate design and whopping 6-figure price tag. Those who weren’t concentrated around the dab rigs were busy sampling edibles, entering raffles, and relaxing with a massage at one the topical company booths.\n\nA judge’s pass to the event allowed visitors to join the action by sampling each of the strains entered into the People\u0027s Choice category of the Cup. For $99, the judge’s pass gave ticket-holders a half gram sample of all 10 anonymous strains and the opportunity to vote for their favorite. The mystery strains all had amazing flavors, ranging from sweet and tropical to earthy and piney, which made it all the more difficult to choose a favorite.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the DOPE Cup winners!\n \nFlower Winners\n\n \nPeople\u0027s Choice Flower\n\nWinner: CPC or Cotton Purple Chem by Hesperides Gardens (Strain #4)\n \nJudges\u0027 Choice Flower\n\nWinner: The Sauce by ExoticGenetix (Strain #6)\n \nBest Indica\n\nWinner: Cascadia Kush by Hesperides Gardens\nRunner Up: The White from Cannabis Club by Freak UV Nature\n \nBest Sativa\n\nWinner: Matanuska Thunder Fuck by TJ\u0027s Gardens\nRunner Up: Head Cheese from Cali Connection\n \nBest Hybrid\n\nWinner: Peppermint Cookies by GoldLeaf Gardens\nRunner Up: GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) by Rain City Cannabis \u0026 Top Shelf\n \nHighest THC\n\nWinner: The White (29.9%) by Solstice\nRunner Up: DT-13 (28.7%) by Patient 99 Care\n \nHighest CBD\n\nWinner: ACDC (18.05%) by Loaded Soda\nRunner Up: ACDC x Charlotte\u0027s Web (17.02%) by B-EZ and Fweedom\n \nConcentrate Winners\n\n \nBest BHO – THC\nWinner: Marmalade (94.36%) from Platinum Extracts\nRunner Up: Private Reserve OG (83.73%) from The Bakeréé\n \nBest BHO – CBD\n\nWinner: Sour Tsunami (83.7%) from Solstice by Refine\nRunner Up: Sour Tsunami (74.08%) by Stoney Extracts\n \nBest CO2 – THC\nWinner: Mixed Berry (48.56%, 110 ppm) by Evergreen Extracts\nRunner Up: Death Star (69.09%, \u003c10 ppm) by Happy Cats – CO2 Organics\n \nBest CO2 – CBD\n\nWinner: ACDC x Remedy (78% CBD, \u003c10 ppm) by Loaded Soda – CO2 Organics\nRunner Up: Evergreen Extracts (42.81% CBD, \u003c10 ppm)\n \nBest Non-Solvent – THC\n\nWinner: Kimbo Kush (84.37%, dry sift) Cuban Tech from Exotic Genetics\nRunner Up: Fire On the Mountain (82.68%) from NW Alchemy featuring Head Hunter\n \nBest Non-Solvent – CBD\n\nWinner: Remedy (52.5% CBD, 3390 ppm ethanol) by Hesperides Gardens\nRunner Up: ACDC (13.41% CBD bubble hash) Loaded Soda by CO2 Organics\n \nEdible Winners\n\n \nBest Edible – Savory\nWinner: Delux Nut Mix by Laurie and Marry Jane\nRunner Up: Capitol Hill Peanut Butter\n \nBest Edible – Sweet\nWinner: Dark Chocolate Fudge by Mad Monster\nRunner Up: Almond Bites by Laurie and Marry Jane\n \nBest Edible – Drink\nWinner: Loaded Soda Root Beer – 104.85 mg THC\nRunner Up: Sensi Sweet Tropical Punch – 58.68 mg THC\n \nBest Edible – CBD\nWinner: Vanilla Truffles from The Bakeree – Cookie Fam Genetics\nRunner Up: Slips by Oakor\n \nBest Topical\nWinner: Kush Cream Cherry Bomb – 2.01 mg THC\nRunner Up: Liberty Lotion High CBD – 1.67 mg CBD","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/12002744/the-2015-dope-cup-winners.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/the-2015-dope-cup-winners"}],"reviewCount":8,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":86.9047619047619},{"name":"Honey","score":66.666666666666657},{"name":"Cheese","score":57.142857142857139},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":50},{"name":"Tree Fruit","score":50}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":157.14285714285714},{"name":"Creative","score":66.666666666666657},{"name":"Sleepy","score":53.571428571428569},{"name":"Happy","score":40.476190476190467},{"name":"Hungry","score":40.476190476190467}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":107.14285714285714},{"name":"Headaches","score":70.238095238095227},{"name":"Pain","score":70.238095238095227},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":57.142857142857139},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":36.9047619047619}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":123.8095238095238},{"name":"Migraines","score":70.238095238095227},{"name":"Anorexia","score":50},{"name":"Cancer","score":50},{"name":"Epilepsy","score":50}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":50},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Dizzy","score":3.5714285714285712}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Denver, CO","Aurora, CO","Beaverton, OR","Fort Collins, CO","Medford, OR","Newport, OR","Ashland, OR","Bend, OR","Berkeley, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/alchemy","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.625/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Chemdawg","subtitle":null,"slug":"chemdawg","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/chemdawg","symbol":"Cd","applink":"leafly://strain/chemdawg"},{"name":"Querkle","subtitle":null,"slug":"querkle","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/querkle","symbol":"Que","applink":"leafly://strain/querkle"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":69,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tTop early to shape\n\tCage or bamboo if support is needed\n\n"}}
