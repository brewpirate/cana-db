She grinned gauged up ear to gauged up ear like the Cheshire Cat, \nAlien Inferno she said\nIt won\u0027t scalp you she said \nTastes like Chicken she said \nShe was right! The first hit flamboyantly screams T.H.C. \n\nDespite it\u0027s info page Alien Inferno is not a chill Indica (dom) for bozos \n\nIt\u0027s a Hybird true (what isn\u0027t) but operates like some kind of legendary Sativa worth reminiscing about years later. \n\nI can\u0027t comment much from 2 weeks ago on the density of buds (pretty dense from what I remember), nor the aroma (but I do remember Earthy and a fiery/spicy/THC zesty scent. \n\nIt\u0027s \"sex appeal\" was better than average, yes, and it\u0027s aroma technically is on the correct side of the not so glamorous world of \"White Fire\" babies (pretty on the inside), but the reason you will sample this isn\u0027t it\u0027s look \nMed and Rec Patients will keep this around to impress other patients with a strain capable of inducing interesting head high thoughts on demand. \n\nThink you have a high flower tolerance? Try A.I.10 \nThat Cheshire Grin wasn\u0027t for nothing.\n\nIt\u0027s wayy more potent of a high than Alien OG and you won\u0027t gamble losing credibility like you might by recommending WiFi (it\u0027s smell).\nRecommending this grandkid is a no brainer. You know how Drew Barrymore is cuter than Lionel Barrymore, well...\n\nUnfortunately I\u0027m not 100% sure from memory if it caused any \"ants in the pants\". I don\u0027t believe so. \nIt\u0027s not for everyone though. It\u0027s THC to the dome effect is a bit much for newbies. And I am not sure why it\u0027s billed as \"letting you unwind\". \n\nThis is very Creative and Active Sativa like head high that will not disappoint anyone looking to smoke flower to get up. You will be impressed. \n\nI\u0027m recommending this for more experienced tokers looking for something worthy of them seeking out. \nBut I don\u0027t believe that calling this a \"Rec strain\" is being totally fair. \nRec effects sure\nBut it\u0027s more complex and refined for such a dirty word. \nIt\u0027s a Medical Grade Rec type strain that is polished enough to belong in many camps. Just don\u0027t go giving this to little sis, that\u0027d be like putting a firecracker in a lizard. \nAnd Jules Winfield doesn\u0027t like brain detail and Ringo doesn\u0027t like brain detail.

Qush\n\nQush is a 70/30 indica-dominant cannabis strain from TGA Genetics, who combines Pre-98 Bubba Kush with Space Queen. Bred for potency as well as flavor, Qush’s resin-packed buds radiate with sweet aromas of grape, cherry, and hashy spice. This tranquilizing strain has a way of calming worries and upset stomachs, but keep in mind that Qush can have a sedating, cloudy effect on the mind so consider saving this one for evenings and lazy days.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Qush\n \n   7.
