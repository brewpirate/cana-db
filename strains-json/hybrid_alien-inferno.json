            "text": "We just updated the Leafly strain database with some new strain varieties and we're curious to see which ones you've tried already. Wanna know where you can find them near you? Check the links below, and don't forget to leave a review if you're able to get your hands on it!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Gremlin\n\nA cross between King Louis XIII and Mogwai (White Fire Alien OG and \u201909 Cookies crossed with a secret strain), Gremlin is a hybrid strain that carries the sweet scent of cookie dough and earthy pine. Heavy-handed euphoria and physical relief melts through the body, dulling pain and insomnia while sharpening the appetite.\n\nGremlin is currently available at Green Life Cannabis in Wenatchee, WA\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Purple Cotton Candy\n\nPurple Cotton Candy by LivWell is a calming indica-dominant hybrid strain that crosses Granddaddy Purple and Cotton Candy Kush. Once inhaled, you will notice a cotton candy flavor in the back of your throat as well as hints of lavender and skunk.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Purple Cotton Candy\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a03. Tree of Life\n\nTree of Life is a unique hybrid cross between Trainwreck and Mendocino Purps, created by Oregon OMMP growers in the late 2000s. It\u2019s known to provide calming euphoria and an uplifting boost of creativity. With a vigorous sativa-dominant growth pattern, Tree of Life produces fully ripened buds with a rich palate of creamy orange zest and lemon balm. An early flowerer, Tree of Life will finish its maturation cycle by the third week of September outdoors. When consumed, Tree of Life has a pleasant taste reminiscent of sandalwood incense.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Tree of Life\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Limon\n\nCreated by LivWell, Limon is a sativa-dominant strain that blends Sour Diesel, Strawberry Diesel, and NYC Diesel. With notes of diesel and skunk in flavor, these bright green frosty buds will leave you with an uplifting and long-lasting cerebral buzz.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Limon\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Good Medicine\n\nThe name says it all with this CBD rich strain. Bred by CBD specialist Bodhi, Good Medicine crosses a Green Crack and Tres Dawg hybrid with the high-CBD Harlequin sativa. Offering sweet flavors of mango and candy followed by a mellow and relaxing high, Good Medicine is great for solving medical needs without keeping you on the couch.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Good Medicine\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Qush\n\nQush is a 70/30 indica-dominant cannabis strain from TGA Genetics, who combines Pre-98 Bubba Kush with Space Queen. Bred for potency as well as flavor, Qush\u2019s resin-packed buds radiate with sweet aromas of grape, cherry, and hashy spice. This tranquilizing strain has a way of calming worries and upset stomachs, but keep in mind that Qush can have a sedating, cloudy effect on the mind so consider saving this one for evenings and lazy days.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Qush\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Alien Inferno\n\nUsing a White Fire #6 and Alien OG hybrid and crossing it again with Diablo, LivWell created Alien Inferno. Rock solid buds slathered in trichomes and red pistils, Alien Inferno is a heavy-handed OG hybrid that can help relieve pain, boost creativity, and help you unwind. With the taste of earth, pine, and lemon, this potent indica-dominant hybrid will take care of even the most experienced connoisseur.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Alien Inferno\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",

            "text": "Alien Inferno #10 \nTop Notch Flower with a big blast of THC on the inhale. \n4 plus Stars. \nWas recommended by the budtendress (you know the cute thin goth one with the nose piercing), when I asked her which strain was a head high that would impress someone who samples different flowers all the time and will hold her to a less than stellar recommendation. She grinned gauged up ear to gauged up ear like the Cheshire Cat, \nAlien Inferno she said\nIt won't scalp you she said \nTastes like Chicken she said \nShe was right! The first hit flamboyantly screams T.H.C. \n\nDespite it's info page Alien Inferno is not a chill Indica (dom) for bozos \n\nIt's a Hybird true (what isn't) but operates like some kind of legendary Sativa worth reminiscing about years later. \n\nI can't comment much from 2 weeks ago on the density of buds (pretty dense from what I remember), nor the aroma (but I do remember Earthy and a fiery/spicy/THC zesty scent. \n\nIt's \"sex appeal\" was better than average, yes, and it's aroma technically is on the correct side of the not so glamorous world of \"White Fire\" babies (pretty on the inside), but the reason you will sample this isn't it's look \nMed and Rec Patients will keep this around to impress other patients with a strain capable of inducing interesting head high thoughts on demand. \n\nThink you have a high flower tolerance? Try A.I.10 \nThat Cheshire Grin wasn't for nothing.\n\nIt's wayy more potent of a high than Alien OG and you won't gamble losing credibility like you might by recommending WiFi (it's smell).\nRecommending this grandkid is a no brainer. You know how Drew Barrymore is cuter than Lionel Barrymore, well...\n\nUnfortunately I'm not 100% sure from memory if it caused any \"ants in the pants\". I don't believe so. \nIt's not for everyone though. It's THC to the dome effect is a bit much for newbies. And I am not sure why it's billed as \"letting you unwind\". \n\nThis is very Creative and Active Sativa like head high that will not disappoint anyone looking to smoke flower to get up. You will be impressed. \n\nI'm recommending this for more experienced tokers looking for something worthy of them seeking out. \nBut I don't believe that calling this a \"Rec strain\" is being totally fair. \nRec effects sure\nBut it's more complex and refined for such a dirty word. \nIt's a Medical Grade Rec type strain that is polished enough to belong in many camps. Just don't go giving this to little sis, that'd be like putting a firecracker in a lizard. \nAnd Jules Winfield doesn't like brain detail and Ringo doesn't like brain detail. ",

No other strain puts me on such a social, uplifting high.\nI often use it in the mornings when I feel depression creeping in, and it kickstarts my day. I get things done and keeps negativity at bay.\nI've used it for a couple family gatherings and, thanks to it, I actually had a good time.\nWhile it's impossible to guarantee every individual will have the same experience, I really can't recommend this enough.",
