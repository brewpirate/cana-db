            "text": "With thousands of cannabis strains to choose from, it can often feel overwhelming choosing a variety you'll enjoy that won't cost a lot of money. Do some cannabis strains give you a better bang for your buck than their high-priced alternatives? We dove into our data to find out.\u00a0\nAfter analyzing all of the strains in our database, we came up with a list of the best reasonably priced options. The criteria for our list included the following requirements:\u00a0\n\nThe strains must be equal to or lower than a median price of $12.88 per gram\nStrains must have at least 100 user reviews and a median rating of 4.3 or higher to indicate popularity and general quality\nStrains must be available on at least 50 dispensary menus, indicating decent availability\n\nWith those parameters in mind, we charted the results of our data dive.\n\nClick on the graph for an enlarged version\n\u00a0\nAccording to our research, the best budget-friendly strains are:\u00a0\n\nBlue Magoo\nPennywise\nG13\nBlue Diesel\nObama Kush\nMK Ultra\nCritical Kush\nWhite Widow\nDeath Star\nLSD\nACDC\nAlaskan Thunder Fuck\nChernobyl\nCherry Pie\nBruce Banner\nAlien OG\nPineapple Express\n\nThese are all strains that are priced somewhat lower than other options on dispensary menus (both recreational and medical) across the country. Generally, solid mid-shelf strain options are priced at about $13 \u2013 $15 per gram, with prices occasionally creeping past $15 depending on the dispensary (although going above $15/gram won't necessarily bring you more potent or higher-quality cannabis).\n\n\u00a0\nPrice-Conscious Hybrids are Popular\n\nThe most popular varieties on this list are ones I'm sure you've heard of: White Widow, Chernobyl, Cherry Pie, and Pineapple Express all enjoy strong menu availability and a large number of user reviews. These varieties, like many of the other options we pulled, are hybrid strains, which is not terribly surprising. Pure strains can be hard to come by these days with the increasing availability of so many hybrid crosses. Jeremiah, our resident strain researcher and former budtender, argues that hybrid popularity isn't necessarily a bad thing, pointing out that hybrids can breed fantastic combinations such as Cherry Pie, which, in his words, \"encapsulates disparate elements in one helluva package.\"\n\u00a0\nBe on the Lookout for These Crowd-Pleasers\n\nSome of the strains on this list are crowd-pleasers that are on a lower number of menus compared to the popular hybrids listed above, but have a high rating and disproportionately large number of reviews. If you pop into a dispensary and see G13, MK Ultra, Critical Kush, Alaskan Thunder Fuck, Bruce Banner, or Alien OG on display, you may want to give them a try.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWant a Reasonably Priced CBD Strain?\n\nIf you're looking for a budget-friendly high-CBD strain, ACDC is the one most likely to leave you thunderstruck. It's the lone CBD option on this list, indicating that it could be friendlier to your wallet than other higher-priced CBD-specific strains.\n\n\u00a0\nBusiness Takeaways\n\nIf you're a dispensary manager, you might want to look into procuring some of these budget strains, as they're all consumer favorites. Despite being lower-priced than mainstays like Blue Dream or the latest big Cannabis Cup winner, stocking what people like at attractive prices will keep them coming back for repeat transactions. Plus, if you can get your hands on some of the crowd-pleasers we outlined above, you're potentially widening your clientele, as those strains have a growing fan base.\u00a0\n\nOf course, for you consumers out there, our data suggests these strains tend to trend on the cheaper side, but pricing is ultimately determined by the dispensary, so you may end up seeing some of these varieties priced differently than what we've charted. Let us know what are some of your favorite budget buds in your area and we'll see how your picks compare to our data!",

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Alien OG is a cross between Tahoe OG and Alien Kush, inheriting a tendency toward heavy, high-quality yields and quick flowering cycles. This strain typically tests extremely high in THC, making it popular among high-tolerance consumers. Its dense, resinous buds carry an earthy, lemon-tinged aroma in demonstration of its OG Kush genetics.\nGrow Techniques: A hydroponic setup can give Alien OG the precise nutrients it needs to flourish. Topping the plant promotes bushy growth and will lead to high yields in an SOG (sea of green) setup.\nFlowering Time: 8 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Difficult\nClimate: Alien OG buds are dense, meaning humidity needs to be monitored to prevent possible mold buildup. It performs best when kept in a climate that stays between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Suitable for either indoor or outdoor gardens.\nFeeding: Heavy feedings, increased as the plant takes in growth, will keep Alien OG charged and happy.",

I typically only rate strains that offer a unique experience - uplifting but mellow, etc. This is just a good old-fashioned, knock your dick in the dirt, THC high! What makes this one unique is its potency - just a few solid puffs and you'll be ready to veg out to The Simpsons while eating cereal straight from the box. This flower is to be cared for, from infancy to ingestion. This is the kind of flower you keep in a humidor. Like a Liga Privada Feral, you only break this out for the most special occassions, the best friends, or that d-bag that's always trying to one-up everyone.  Guaranteed, this'll shut 'em up!",

            "text": "Daily smokers rejoice as this strain does the job & more. Lots of Kush goodness here with the parents being Alien Kush & Tahoe OG Kush. My dense medium green buds with dark orange hairs packed 22% THC. The scent was pine/lemon/skunk & the flavor was a bit spicy but, nice. Best thing about this strain was the effects. Start off & everything is sharper and clearer with all senses. I was happy & euphoric while being uplifted. Then as time passes ( which can be hard to tell because once i thought about 30 minutes had passed only to look at the clock to see it had only been 5!? i became very relaxed & sleepy. This strain is a bit \"racy\" & i can see it making one a bit paranoid. This strain produces an intense high, ENJOY!",
