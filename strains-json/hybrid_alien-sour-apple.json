Very chill while hearing is extremely tuned up. Music sounds clearer and is immediately one of the best for getting lost in and taken for a ride. Another one of the best aspects of the high is a childlike enthusiasm that comes pouring out like euphoria. Very mdma-like in how genuinely thrilled you are to communicate and socialize. A considerably unique, but wonderfully good-natured high. There is a weightiness that you can feel suppressing and amplifying a hefty disassociation, but it’s not oppressive. Despite how out-of-body and tripped out you are, it sits on you lightly. Very nicely balanced sativa. Greatly appreciate the absence of any speediness or raciness...or really anything uncomfortable. That’d almost make it safe for beginners if the high wasn’t so hallucinogenic - which may be too much. Just looked up the genetics and they’re literally the worst offenders of racy/speedy highs, so super fascinating they came together so well here. 9/10","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/kZ3iwRmPT5O6arIA05kqrPWjazc=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net%2fdZCCCxYREQnXfPfK6mXSTpqotAY%3d%2f120x120%2fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3.amazonaws.com%252Fleafly%252Fbin%252FGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":18,"flavors":[{"name":"Apple","score":73.8095238095238},{"name":"Sweet","score":18.452380952380949},{"name":"Citrus","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Lemon","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Diesel","score":8.3333333333333321}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":36.9047619047619},{"name":"Uplifted","score":28.571428571428569},{"name":"Creative","score":28.571428571428569},{"name":"Relaxed","score":28.571428571428569},{"name":"Happy","score":22.023809523809522}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":18.452380952380949},{"name":"Insomnia","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Depression","score":10.119047619047617},{"name":"Fatigue","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":1.7857142857142856}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":18.452380952380949},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":10.119047619047617},{"name":"Migraines","score":10.119047619047617},{"name":"PTSD","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Tourette\u0027s Syndrome","score":8.3333333333333321}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":10.119047619047617},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":8.3333333333333321}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/alien-sour-apple_100x100_c5fa.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/518029/b/alien-sour-apple__primary_ed05.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/alien-sour-apple_100x100_61e0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/405804/b/alien-sour-apple__primary_0727.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/alien-sour-apple_100x100_2bed.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/406028/b/alien-sour-apple__primary_69ce.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/alien-sour-apple_100x100_2652.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/370531/b/alien-sour-apple__primary_126c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/alien-sour-apple_100x100_99f2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/304282/b/alien-sour-apple__primary_eb76.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":5,"popularCities":["Phoenix, AZ"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-sour-apple","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.66666666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Alien Dawg","subtitle":null,"slug":"alien-dawg","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/alien-dawg","symbol":"Adg","applink":"leafly://strain/alien-dawg"},{"name":"Sour Apple","subtitle":null,"slug":"sour-apple","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-apple","symbol":"Sa","applink":"leafly://strain/sour-apple"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
