I may come back later and update.  Another find from my guitar buddy.  We had set up a jam session and he gave me a choice of several strains and I grabbed this one.  Not an overpowering aroma but pleasant, with a slight fruit smell.  The draw was just a bit harsh but it could have been the pipe since I\u0027m used to joints.  I thought I read previously Aloha Limone was a hybrid that leaned sativa so figured it would be good choice for the jam session.  Now due to constraints of work I was limited to a decent one hit.  Sucks...but life y\u0027know?  For a simple one hit however, I actually felt a decent kick.  It seemed all sativa to me.  We both were able to rip through some songs and unlike the Chemdawg 4 experience where neither of us could keep our place in a song, we had no problem focusing.  Wish You Were Here...Through The Glass and a couple other tunes were no problem.  This looks like a go-to for future guitar jams.  Can\u0027t wait to try a bigger sample and see if the same holds true.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/tAHHcVjF5EvieYWgrsxPA0WBCr8=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fRAbBXkNBSHOIMMxhio7k_wide-brim-red.png"},{"id":1598932,"username":"cashmyn","text":"Gives you a clearheaded super high that makes you want to be active and get outside.
