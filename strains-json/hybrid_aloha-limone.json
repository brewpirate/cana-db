            "text": "I probably should refrain from reviewing this strain until I try a larger sample but I was pretty impressed so I wanted to do a quick review.  I may come back later and update.  Another find from my guitar buddy.  We had set up a jam session and he gave me a choice of several strains and I grabbed this one.  Not an overpowering aroma but pleasant, with a slight fruit smell.  The draw was just a bit harsh but it could have been the pipe since I'm used to joints.  I thought I read previously Aloha Limone was a hybrid that leaned sativa so figured it would be good choice for the jam session.  Now due to constraints of work I was limited to a decent one hit.  Sucks...but life y'know?  For a simple one hit however, I actually felt a decent kick.  It seemed all sativa to me.  We both were able to rip through some songs and unlike the Chemdawg 4 experience where neither of us could keep our place in a song, we had no problem focusing.  Wish You Were Here...Through The Glass and a couple other tunes were no problem.  This looks like a go-to for future guitar jams.  Can't wait to try a bigger sample and see if the same holds true.",
