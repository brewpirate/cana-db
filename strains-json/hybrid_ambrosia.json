Seriously; you think you know your cat pretty well, but if you really lock eyes with the creature and allow the mind-meld to sluice on through, you realize you don't know shit about what's going on in that furry little feline head, and you fully grok that all this time you've been sharing your house with a little four footed alien. \n\nOh and this strain also gives some serious cottonmouth, so make sure to have some cold fizzy water on hand.",
