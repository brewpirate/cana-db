            "text": "Looking back at 2015, I can\u2019t help but play a nostalgic montage in my head of all the strains that came and went over the year. Legal markets are becoming saturated with choices, so much so that it\u2019s impossible to determine 2015\u2019s best cream of the crop. Instead, we took a look at the fastest growing strain trends based on Leafly reviews and determined which varieties made the biggest splash last year.\nDispensaries and rec shops, you better keep your eye out for these rising stars in 2016! You\u2019ll definitely want them blessing your shelves.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n#1. GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4)\n \nGG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4) blew it out of the water this year with an astounding 906% increase in user ratings and reviews. That kind of growth is pretty mind-blowing, but if you\u2019ve tried Gorilla Glue, it starts to make sense.\nEven through a sealed container, I could pick up every intricacy of its aroma: earthy pine soured by loud notes of skunky diesel. Trying to pry the buds apart, I can see how this champ got its name; the resin oozing from these trichomes might as well be heavy-duty adhesive. In describing the effects, I can say it no better than this Leafly reviewer who wrote, \u201cI needed a seatbelt for reality.\u201d Me too, dude.\n\u00a0\n#2. Critical Kush\n \nHeir to the Critical Mass throne is Critical Kush, an indica strain that saw a staggering 407% increase in user engagement this year. By crossing Critical Mass with the West Coast favorite OG Kush, it\u2019s no surprise that Critical Kush is taking off in the U.S. A subtle citrusy lemon OG aroma adds a layer of interest to Critical Mass\u2019 muted hashy and earthy flavors, and its moderate CBD content complements its THC-rich profile for beautifully relaxing effects that one Leafly user compares to a slow massage.\n\u00a0\n#3. Candyland\n \nCandyland grew almost 380% this year, making it the fastest growing sativa among Leafly users in 2015. The first thing most people note about this strain is its strikingly sweet flavor, a quality that\u2019s earned this strain her name. Its twisting hues of blue, purple, white, and green are also something to write home about, as well as its dueling effects that balance gracefully between relaxing and uplifting. Candyland has been called \u201ca work of art\u201d by Leafly users, while another claimed it was \u201cBy far one of the best strains I had of 2015.\u201d Apparently everyone else agrees.\n\u00a0\n#4. ACDC\n \nNext up is ACDC, a high-CBD hybrid that grew 356% this year. I believe it. A lot of high-CBD strains I\u2019ve tried have a grassy, hay-like aroma and a scraggly appearance, but ACDC is a refreshingly beautiful anomaly. Sweet, zesty lemon notes burst from its crystal-coated buds in an impressively fragrant introduction to its relaxing, clear-headed effects. Reviewers rave over its ability to chase off pain and anxiety without cerebral euphoria or mental cloudiness, which can make all the difference in many medical patients\u2019 lives.\n\u00a0\n#5. Bubblegum Kush\n \nStep aside, Bubble Gum. Your Kush-infused offspring is taking center stage with a yearly growth rate of 284%. Maintaining a sweet floral and bubble gum aroma, this hybrid gets its enhanced resin production from its hash monster of its second parent, Hindu Kush. It may anchor your body with a physical heaviness, but many reviewers claim this strain still leaves the mind agile and motivated.\n\u00a0\n#6. Sunset Sherbet\n \nOnce upon a time, you\u2019d see its parent GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) on this list, so it comes as no surprise that the offspring Sunset Sherbert is dominating the market with a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 276%. As one reviewer wrote, Sunset Sherbert \u201csmells as if heaven cracked open its Mason jars and said \u2018enjoy.\u2019\u201d Yes, it\u2019s that good.\n\u00a0\n#7. Tangie\n \nClimbing 236% in ratings and reviews this year, the Tangie sativa is a flavor masterpiece. Its aroma spans the entire citrus spectrum with fruity notes of orange, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. Even if this strain didn\u2019t have its amazingly uplifting and upbeat effects, I bet you\u2019d still buy this strain for its flavor alone.\n\u00a0\n#8. Jedi Kush\n \nEither Star Wars fans spent the entirety of 2015 enjoying Jedi Kush in anticipation of the new sequel or it really is that good, because this indica grew 235% among Leafly visitors. It hits with the force of a Jedi master, delivering heavy-handed euphoria that\u2019ll launch you to a galaxy far, far away.\n\u00a0\n#9. Animal Cookies\n \nAlso called Animal Crackers, this powerhouse hybrid hiked 224% in 2015. This one\u2019s known to reach impressively high THC heights and provide stupefying effects that can knock out even the most seasoned veteran. As one Leafly reviewer poetically describes it, Animal Cookies is a \u201csoothing, nap-time, I-wish-I-had-money-for-pizza, loving-my-1,000-thread-count-sheets strain.\u201d\n\u00a0\n#10. OG #18\n \nWith an annual growth rate of 210%, OG #18 (AKA Private Reserve) gained quite a bit of momentum this year. This supreme OG Kush phenotype has snagged numerous awards for its potency, and fans of OG genetics will appreciate how this hybrid captures and enhances the most cherished qualities of OG Kush: its pungent diesel, lemon, and pine flavors; a thick and sticky coat of resin; high-flying euphoria; and pain-relieving anesthetic effects that patients gush over.\nDispensaries, you might want to update your Leafly listing menus to include these trending strains. Don\u2019t have a Leafly listing? We can fix that!",

Not overly arousing, which is something I'm always on the lookout for, but highly visual much like the Fire OG from which it is born though a bit more subtle when consumed at a low to moderate level.  I, however, went all out and noticed that, when writing text, the words appeared backwards as if I were writing Hebrew.  Kinda cool but not an experience for everyday.
