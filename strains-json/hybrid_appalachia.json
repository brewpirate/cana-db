We all have heard of Alaskan Thunderfuck , but personally I've never heard of this cross. The flowers I have are absolutely beautiful and are incredibly potent. You will be either incredibly lucky or a grower to run across this powerhouse . For sure sativa dominant but wow the indica side creeps up on you within 10 min. If your lucky enough to find this strain pick it up , I'd say very close to what I consider a perfect \"high \" (60% sativa/40% indica ). ",
