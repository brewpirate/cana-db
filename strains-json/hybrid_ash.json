            "text": "A few years ago a friend of Corey Capasso\u2019s called him up. \u201cCorey, you know when you smoke a water pipe, how the water gets dirty?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Capasso said. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\u201cSo the water is filtering out the tar from the smoke, making it cleaner. What if you could put something in the water to enhance the filtration?\u201d\nCapasso thought for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d he said.\nWhen Corey Capasso finds something interesting, things tend to happen. Nine years ago, as a finance major at the University of Wisconsin, Capasso sought out Tim Osswald, a mechanical engineering professor. Would it be possible, Capasso asked him, to create a flavored plastic? Osswald did so in 2008, and Capasso turned his tasty polymer into MoGo Sport, the company that invented the flavored sport mouthguard.\nAs he was getting MoGo off the ground, Capasso also did a little work on the side. He was intrigued by his friend\u2019s water pipe question.\n\u201cI did some research and realized that water is very polar,\u201d Capasso recalled in a recent interview with Leafly. \u201cThe majority of the tars and carcinogens in smoke \u2014 both tobacco and marijuana \u2014 are very nonpolar. If we could put something in the water that was also nonpolar, the tars might be attracted and get trapped by it.\u201d\nThe easiest way to understand molecular polarity is to think of it as the opposite of magnetism. With polarity, like attracts like. Oil and water don\u2019t mix, for example, because water is extremely polar and oil is highly nonpolar.\nWhen he went looking for scientific research on water filtration of smoke, Capasso found slim pickings in the peer-reviewed literature. Surprisingly little research has been done on cannabis smoke filtration. There are essentially two publicly available water pipe studies, both conducted in the mid-1990s. One was by Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML. The other was by Nicholas Cozzi, director of the Laboratory for Neuropharmacology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health and one of the world\u2019s leading experts on hallucinogens and the human brain.\n\nThose studies found that water pipes are good at filtering out hot ash, but they\u2019re generally lousy at trapping the tars contained in both tobacco and cannabis smoke. They obviously trap some \u2014 hence the nastiness of bong water \u2014 but in general the bong lets most of the tars slip through.\n\u201cBy weird coincidence, Dr. Cozzi was at the University of Wisconsin, where I was attending college,\u201d Capasso recalled. He reached out to Cozzi and, as he had with Tim Osswald, convinced the professor to explore the possibilities of invention.\nAs it happened, Cozzi knew of a nonpolar material that just might work. It was a kind of macrobead \u2014 tiny, but larger than the microbeads currently causing so much trouble in toothpaste and facial scrubs \u2014 made of an inert, insoluble polymer that was highly attractive to nonpolar molecules. \u201cIt\u2019s a substance used in chromatography,\u201d Cozzi explained over the phone recently. \u201cIt separates mixtures of compounds into their elements.\u201d\nThe stuff itself looks like large sugar crystals. \u201cYou pour it into the pipe and it floats on the water,\u201d Capasso explained. \u201cThe smoke goes through the water, hits the beads, and those beads absorb ten times the amount of carcinogens as the water.\u201d In early tests, Cozzi found that plain water removed 1.7 milligrams of tar per gram of water. The combination of Smoke Skreen beads and water extracted 20.6 milligrams of tar per gram.\n\nDetail of Smoke Skreen beads\nCapasso and Cozzi applied for patents on their invention, a \u201cfiltration agent\u201d they named Smoke Skreen. That was in 2010. They waited. Years passed. From the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office came nothing but radio silence.\nIn the meantime, Capasso moved on to other entrepreneurial ventures. In 2010 he founded Spinback, an online analytics company, and sold it to Buddy Media. Then he created Nomi, an in-store analytics platform for retailers, and sold it to Brickstream.\nWhile casting about for his next analytics venture, Capasso received a surprise visit from the past. On Dec. 30, 2015, he opened an email from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Arlington, Virginia. The patent for Smoke Skreen had finally been approved.\n\nIt had been so long \u2014 more than five years \u2014 that Capasso figured the office had lost or permanently shelved his application.\nThe patent itself had always been a long shot. The federal illegality of cannabis extends to \u201cdrug paraphernalia,\u201d (see 21 USC Section 863), which specifically mentions water pipes and bongs. Though the law is rarely enforced, Tommy Chong famously got caught up in Operation Pipe Dreams, a 2003 federal paraphernalia sting that resulted in the arrest of 55 individuals. (Chong was the only one sent to prison. He served nine months for selling bongs.) Even today, head shops in legal states like Washington will sometimes evict customers who refer to their \u201ctobacco water pipes\u201d as bongs. That problematic legal status has made it difficult for inventors to obtain patents for any product that could be considered paraphernalia.\nThough Capasso and Cozzi made frequent mention of tobacco in their patent application, they specifically referenced \u201cmedical marijuana\u201d in their patent documentation. \u201cTo my knowledge, as long as the product is described accurately and does not make any false claims under FTC regulations, there are no legal issues,\u201d Capasso said.\nThe question every cannabis consumer will want to know: If it so effectively screens out tars, will it also screen out cannabinoids? Not so much, says Cozzi. \u201cThe tars are extremely nonpolar, and the THC, CBD and other cannabinoids are intermediate in polarity, meaning they contain both polar and nonpolar properties within the molecule.\u201d The Smoke Skreen beads, Cozzi said, will preferentially remove the tars but not the cannabinoids. \u201cOur empirical testing showed no effect on the psychoactive properties of the cannabis.\u201d\nNow he\u2019s talking with a number of companies and potential investors. Capasso is new to the legal cannabis space, but thinks his product has the potential to find a big audience. \u201cAs marijuana grows,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing better to have in a regulated market than a product that creates safety.\u201d",
