            "text": "There\u2019s nobody we\u2019d rather spend Valentine\u2019s Day with than all of you Leafly fans. Thanks for making our website and app such a success! You fill the buds in our heart.\nTo celebrate this amorous day, here are a few strains you might want to pick up for you and your honey, as they\u2019ve been tagged by Leafly visitors as having an \u201carousing\u201d effect. Enjoy!\nTo Kick the Evening Off\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be of the Asian \u201cpersuasian\u201d to enjoy this titillating sativa. Though Asian Fantasy is a somewhat rare find, this strain delivers arousing, energetic, and relaxing effects, as well as flavors of apples and cheese.\n\u201cthis strain smells and taste so good with a more sativa buzz to it\u201d \u2013 lazytoke\n\nSweet and citrusy, Ultimate Trainwreck is rated high in arousal, focus, and happiness, which sounds like a recipe for a fun evening with your loved one.\n\u201cBy far one of my favorite strains. Just make sure you have a couch nearby, because you won\u2019t be leaving it for a few hours. Smelled like an Angel\u2019s Lady Parts, after they\u2019d been put through 4 Quarters of an NFL game. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d \u2013 Sinsation\nTo Keep Things Going Right\n\nThis pretty Purple Princess has berry flavors and will leave you feeling creative, energetic, and euphoric \u2014 a perfect combination for trying out some new moves on your own prince or princess.\n\u201creally nice head high, noticed a little cough so I broke it up and noticed that was a better idea. this girl has allot of branches tucked in her, not a terrible pain though because it\u2019s easier to decipher flower because of her dark purple color. the feeling i instantly have after smoking it is it makes me feel happy in my head, really nice to listen to music on or some sexual adventure, I can see too. I donated a 25 and to my surprise she hits hard as a cerebral high and could have a couch lock feel if you let it.\u201d \u2013 DevyantByson\n\nSour Dream is a beautiful hybrid of Blue Dream and\u00a0Sour Diesel, resulting in an earthy, pungent experience that will spark arousal, euphoria, and a touch of the giggles. Keep you and your honey\u2019s mood in amorous spirits with this Dream.\n\u201cJust picked up and was surprised by the high I got. It smokes smooth and the high is even smoother. Drops you in some giggle fits and some longs conversations.\u00a0Very social, functional, and fun high. Highly recommended if you want to uplift your day and go out and do something.\u201d \u2013 Anonymous/a>\nTo Take You Straight to Cuddle Town\n\nWhile it\u2019s another somewhat rare find, Yumboldt is a potent strain that will help you and your drift off to sleep after a night of sexy shenanigans feeling happy and relaxed.\n\u201cThis is an effective strain of cannabis that provides a smooth, mellow, and pain relieving high. It has a very pleasant scent, with a great taste.. along with thick, beautiful orange hairs on the buds. As a veteran smoker, I will say that it\u2019s one of the very best.\u201d \u2013 Anonymous\n\nSome people can\u2019t celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day without a piece of chocolate, so Chocolate Chunk is a perfect way to cap off your special night. With flavors most commonly described as nutty, earthy, and coffee, this strain offers a rich way to help you both drift off to sleep.\n\u201cI enjoy this strain before I end the day. It really helps me unwind all my stress after a long busy day.\u201d \u2013 jakeyodice\nRecommended By Leafly\u00a0Users\nLooking to stock up on even more sexy strains? Here are some Leafly visitor reviews that highlight some of our strains\u2019 seductive sides:\n\n\u201cSeriously, the sex on this strain has been\u2026 the BEST ever. My wife and I love it. My only complaint about GC is it doesn\u2019t allow a solid night\u2019s sleep. Instead, I can be restless and wake up feeling and looking tired. Oh well, not a big deal for weekends. And did I mention the sex? Wow.\u201d \u2013 Synthie\n\n\u201cHad great sex & amazing orgasm. Great daytime/sexytime strain\u201d \u2013 koesherbacon\n\n\u201cWow, best sex of my life after this stuff! Great overall high, only down part is the scary dry eyes it\u2019s typically gives.\u201d \u2013 Anonymous\n\n\u201cSTRONG.\u00a0extremely aroused\u2026 uncontrollable sex drive pain relief. head high is psychedlic and introspective but not euphoric. \u2013 georgeeliot\nLast, but certainly not least, this offering\u00a0seems to be quite the popular arousing strain among our visitors:\n\n\u201cI love it. Great high, great smell, awsome taste and an amazing high. Great to have sex while using. I recommend this strain to anyone.\u201d \u2013 Long_live12\n\u201cYou won\u2019t need Viagra with this awesome strain.\u201d \u2013 ZenKat\n\u201cThis one makes both the male and female hormone go a little wild and if your lucky the sex better.\u201d \u2013 McLovin94",
