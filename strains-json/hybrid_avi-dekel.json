            "text": "For some, it may come as a surprise that Israel stands among the global leaders in medicinal cannabis research. Discoveries made in the footsteps of Raphael Mechoulam (the internationally acclaimed researcher who first isolated THC) have brought new meaning to medical cannabis as strains are engineered to contain optimal levels of cannabinoids.\nHere are\u00a0just a few strains from the Israeli cannabis supplier\u00a0Tikun Olam\u00a0that we recently added to the Leafly Explorer. Most of them are low- to moderate-THC and high-CBD, meaning they offer imperceptible psychoactive effects but strong medical relief from pain symptoms. One strain, however, is a balanced blend of low-to-moderate\u00a0THC and CBD. Enjoy!\n1. Avi-Dekel\nCharacteristics of Avi-Dekel:\n\nSativa-dominant\nTests up to 16.3% CBD\nNon-psychoactive; THC content as low as 0.8%\nMay treat inflammation, sleep disorders, and indigestion\n\n2. Midnight\nCharacteristics of Midnight:\n\nSativa-dominant\nTests up to 12.4% CBD\nTHC content of about 12.7%\nControls pain, inflammation, and indigestion\n\n3. Eran Almog\nCharacteristics of Eran Almog:\n\n80% indica\nTests up to 28% THC\nMay treat sleep disorders, nausea, inflammation, pain, and indigestion\n\n4. El-Na \nCharacteristics of El-Na: \n\nA 50/50 hybrid \nBalanced THC (as low as 8.2%) and CBD (up to 6.5%) for patients unaccustomed to psychoactive effects\nGood for pain, nausea, and stress relief \n\n5. Rafael \nCharacteristics of Rafael: \n\nSativa-dominant \nHigh CBD; up to 18.6% \nLow THC; as low as 1%\n\nphoto credit: RonAlmog via photopin cc",

            "text": "Since I have GAD I decided to give this strain a try. My Licensed Producer is MedReleaf. When I first opened the container a sweet, pungent smell hit my nose. My batch had 15% CBD and .89 % THC. It has a beautiful aroma and when vaporized it actually tastes a bit like sweet tarts. :) This strain effectively relieved my chronic pain from scoliosis and also calmed my anxious mind. There is no psychoactive effect from this strain, just an overall good feeling. You could have a puff of this and go about your work. No one would even know you were medicated! \n\nIn the evening if I'm relaxing I tend to mix this and a high THC Indica. It's a very therapeutic high that creates a unique sensation. \n\nDefinitely worth trying! ",

            "text": "Flower/ 2 hits\n\nPROS: works surprisingly well for inflammation \n-doesn't get you high\n\nCONS:\n-smoke is harsh\n-gave me a short term headache \n-brain felt foggy (not stoned)\n\nIt really helped with inflammation of my joints from rock climbing and my arthritis. You will still feel your joint pains but helped reduce it a lot. Harshness of smoke might be avoided by vape. The trade off of the headache is why I rate this a 3 mostly. That and the brain fog. It's not a stoned feeling. More of a \"I can't think straight in the morning cause I haven't had my coffee\".",
