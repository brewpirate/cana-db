            "text": "For some, it may come as a surprise that Israel stands among the global leaders in medicinal cannabis research. Discoveries made in the footsteps of Raphael Mechoulam (the internationally acclaimed researcher who first isolated THC) have brought new meaning to medical cannabis as strains are engineered to contain optimal levels of cannabinoids.\nHere are\u00a0just a few strains from the Israeli cannabis supplier\u00a0Tikun Olam\u00a0that we recently added to the Leafly Explorer. Most of them are low- to moderate-THC and high-CBD, meaning they offer imperceptible psychoactive effects but strong medical relief from pain symptoms. One strain, however, is a balanced blend of low-to-moderate\u00a0THC and CBD. Enjoy!\n1. Avi-Dekel\nCharacteristics of Avi-Dekel:\n\nSativa-dominant\nTests up to 16.3% CBD\nNon-psychoactive; THC content as low as 0.8%\nMay treat inflammation, sleep disorders, and indigestion\n\n2.

Eran Almog\nCharacteristics of Eran Almog:\n\n80% indica\nTests up to 28% THC\nMay treat sleep disorders, nausea, inflammation, pain, and indigestion\n\n4.

            "text": "With a 2:1 CBD/THC ratio, this strain shouldn't get you too \"high\".  I cannot tolerate high amounts of THC so I thought this strain would be perfect.   It wasn't.   I don't know if it's just this particular crop,  but this was not the medicinal Avi-dekel I was led to believe it was (maybe that's why this shop now calls it something different (YiLo CBD) but,  when I bought it,  it was listed as Avi-dekel).  Regardless, I advise others to be very careful - one of the side effects of this strain was extreme depression.  EXTREME.   I am not depressed,  have never been treated for depression and have never had problem with depression but,  about 5 days after starting to use this strain,  I became very depressed.   While under its influence, the depressive effect was overwhelming. Absolutely horrible.  The heavy depressive effects lasted for about 5 hours after. I finally just stopped using it - still having a fair amount of it left.   That's how bad the depression was.   ",
