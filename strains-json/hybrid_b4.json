Now, as a person with ADHD you’ll often head upstairs to go do that next thing and by the time your up their with this strain you’ll possibly forget why you walked upstairs.\n\nOnly reason for 4/5, unfortunately vape a bit to much and that blue dream paranoia sets in a bit and it keeps you awake thinking about everything rather than a night strain.  Would recommend before going out for the morning or afternoon.
