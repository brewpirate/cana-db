I woke up very upset (in tears) over a breakup, and reached for my vape pen which had a cartridge of  Naked brand Banana Cream OG (90% thc distillate) attached. I went from sobbing to perky and happy to be awake. That was about 20 mins ago, and now that I’m writing this review, I  can’t remember why I was ever upset in the first place. Thank you, Banana Cream!  \n Ratings:\nTaste/terps—  5.0/5.0\nDepression— 5.0/5.0\nStress \u0026 Anxiety— 4.75/5.0\nInsomnia—   3.0/5.0\nPain—  4.0/5.0\nAppetite—  3.75/5.0\n\nOverall: 4.25/5.0 highly recommend for depression ","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":13,"flavors":[{"name":"Mint","score":106.66666666666667},{"name":"Pine","score":10},{"name":"Sweet","score":6.666666666666667},{"name":"Menthol","score":3.3333333333333335},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":3.3333333333333335}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":123.33333333333333},{"name":"Happy","score":110},{"name":"Uplifted","score":63.333333333333336},{"name":"Euphoric","score":60},{"name":"Focused","score":56.666666666666664}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":56.666666666666664},{"name":"Stress","score":56.666666666666664},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":53.333333333333336},{"name":"Nausea","score":53.333333333333336},{"name":"Pain","score":53.333333333333336}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":53.333333333333336},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":50},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":50},{"name":"PTSD","score":50}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dizzy","score":3.3333333333333335}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Las Vegas, NV","Detroit, MI","Salem, OR","Anacortes, WA","Berkeley, CA","Cle Elum, WA","Cottage Grove, OR","Eugene, OR","Los Angeles, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-cream-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.69230769230769/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Blue Dream","subtitle":null,"slug":"blue-dream","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-dream","symbol":"Bd","applink":"leafly://strain/blue-dream"},{"name":"Banana OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"banana-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-og","symbol":"Bng","applink":"leafly://strain/banana-og"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
