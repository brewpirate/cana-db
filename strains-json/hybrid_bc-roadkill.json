This top-shelf strain is rumored to be one of the stinkiest out there (though not in the same way that roadkill is). Growers love this strain for its consistent above average yields and 8 week flowering time. The flowers will be large and purple-blue with red hairs, and they typically reek of skunk and citrus. Its musky aroma is due to its BC Roadkill Skunk parent, which was bred with Deep Chunk to create this hybrid. Consumers also flock to scoop up this Roadkill for its strong buzz that is relaxing and trancey without being a complete knockout.

I do not like strains that cause anxiety or paranoia of any kind so I am very particular with the strains I like, especially hybrids.  This is Fun!!  A light, euphoric kind of floaty high.  I could function comfortably and I felt so nice.  I have some social anxiety and I had no problem being in a social situation. It is a relaxed, and a really different than anything I have tried.
