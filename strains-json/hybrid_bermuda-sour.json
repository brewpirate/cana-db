I\u0027m keeping it in my flower rotation.  I use a vaporizer at 410 degrees and I\u0027m good to go for 3 hours of active peace.  This was recommended for my anxiety and depression (supposedly a 50/50 sativa/indica strain).  And yes, it works.  It lifts without making me a paranoid, giggly mess (which I hate). \n\nI don\u0027t feel that it\u0027s a \"body high\" for me or particularly euphoric to the point where I\u0027m crying over commercials.  But it lifts a bit, and it calms a bit.  I would not use this for insomnia though - it\u0027s better utilized as a late afternoon helper.  If you still have work to do and the depression monster wants to drag you down by the ankles... this would probably help.  No couch lock, no headaches, and you won\u0027t be a mindless, sleepy stoner.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/5DsWrIpoq-56NpD59UXAqpoVN88=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fqSLuo6zNRCeIia1paBYS_wayfarers-purple.png"},{"id":1599875,"username":"amberh225","text":"this was a very light green strain ,very dense","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":2,"flavors":[{"name":"Diesel","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Sweet","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Citrus","score":33.333333333333329}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":66.666666666666657},{"name":"Hungry","score":66.666666666666657},{"name":"Relaxed","score":66.666666666666657},{"name":"Energetic","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Focused","score":33.333333333333329}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":33.333333333333329}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Arthritis","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Asthma","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Migraines","score":33.333333333333329}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":66.666666666666657}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Hillsboro, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/bermuda-sour","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"East Coast Sour Diesel","subtitle":null,"slug":"east-coast-sour-diesel","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/east-coast-sour-diesel","symbol":"Eas","applink":"leafly://strain/east-coast-sour-diesel"},{"name":"Triangle Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"triangle-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/triangle-kush","symbol":"Trk","applink":"leafly://strain/triangle-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
