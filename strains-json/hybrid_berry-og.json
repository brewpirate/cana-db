            "text": "Shortly after smoking you will feel a strong head buzz building up; then, right before it peaks, the sensation disperses throughout your body making you feel comfortably heavy. Suddenly you find yourself covered by a blanket of relaxation and euphoria as you enter a neurological black hole in which time, sounds, and thoughts are stretched and morphed. My favorite thing about this strain is that it allows you to focus on a task even when you're stoned- you'll feel drawn to whatever you're doing whilst remaining in a state of deep relaxation and feeling uplifted. You'll really enjoy the way you start to think about things in a whole new perspective, really neat. I recommend this. \n\n",
