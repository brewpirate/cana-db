Right off the bat you get an uplifting, creative, buzz thanks to the white widow genetics. I prefer smoking this right before something like playing guitar or writing, rather than before going to bed. The high does turn into a pleasant couch lock eventually. The flavor imo isn\u0027t my favorite - it\u0027s got an earthy/spice/wood thing happening.
