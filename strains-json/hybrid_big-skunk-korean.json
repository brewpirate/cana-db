You can also find out if anyone near you has them in stock by checking the \"Availability\" tab. Fans of Super Silver Haze and Trainwreck will delight in these new hybrids, and those with a penchant for old-world genetics should check out the landrace-based additions. Happy strain hunting!\n\n  Hoodwreck\n\nDeveloped in Mt. Hood, OR, by Valhalla Pharm, Hoodwreck is a sativa-dominant hybrid cross of Trainwreck and Purple Diesel. These dense, sticky, dark green buds feature purple highlights and an earthy, slightly citrusy scent with a sweet diesel flavor when smoked. The effects of this strain creep up on you slowly, gradually elevating your mood and fully relaxing your body.\n\n \n  Sweet Black Angel\n\nSamsara Seeds crossed two very different strains, the sativa-dominant Super Silver Haze and pure indica Black Domina, to create an easy-to-grow, quick-flowering indica-dominant hybrid that produces heavy yields of high-quality flowers. Sweet Black Angel presents a sweet musky odor with undertones of blackberry, and a relaxing body high most suitable for nighttime use for the treatment of pain, anxiety, and insomnia.\n\n \n  Big Skunk Korean\n\nBig Skunk Korean is supposedly a mix of Big Bud, Skunk #1, and Korean genetics originating in the western U.S., possibly Oregon, though it is unclear when it was created and by whom. It was used by SOMA in many of his breeding projects and is listed as a parent strain for Somativa, Kahuna, Lavender and Somango, among others.\n\n \n  Silver Train\n\nSilver Train is a hybrid of two very well-known and popular strains, Super Silver Haze and Trainwreck, that produces very resinous flowers and a sweet-spicy aroma that is similar to that of Trainwreck. Typical of many sativa-dominant strains, expect a high that is uplifting and euphoric.\n\n\n  Alien Technology\n\nVery little is known about Alien Technology other than it is a landrace strain selected from a handful of seeds acquired by breeder OBSoul33t from a US soldier returning from Afghanistan. It is a pure indica that features light green buds, incredible trichome production, and a spicy, hashy flavor/aroma with fuel undertones. Reports indicate that the high is more stimulating than your typical indica, while lasting as long as 6 hours. Alien Technology has been used in breeding some of today’s most potent hybrids such as Alien Dawg and Alien Kush.\n\n \n  OCA’s Cloud 9\n\nOCA’s Cloud 9 is a phenotype of the mysterious Brazilian landrace strain known as Borderliner. Though the flowers don’t have a pronounced odor, just a slightly sweet smell, they pack a serious punch, some testing at over 30% THC. And while Borderliner is noted for having a heavy, indica-like effect, OCA’s Cloud 9 gives users an energizing and uplifting high that is good for combating depression and anxiety while also offering excellent pain relief. Keep in mind this strain is different from Cloud 9 by Kiwiseeds and Dampkring Classics.\n\n \n  Alien Stardawg\n\nAlien Stardawg is a sativa-dominant hybrid cross of Alien Kush and Stardawg bred by Green Beanz Seeds. Stretchy plants produce large yields of frosty green, red, blue, and purple colored buds with pleasing cherry hash and chem-fuel flavors and a potent well-rounded high.\n\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/12002418/new-strains-alert-sweet-black-angel-silver-train-hoodwreck-alien.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-sweet-black-angel-silver-train-hoodwreck-alien"}],"reviewCount":2,"flavors":[{"name":"Flowery","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Skunk","score":8.3333333333333321}],"effects":[{"name":"Talkative","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Uplifted","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Creative","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Energetic","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Hungry","score":8.3333333333333321}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Fatigue","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Nausea","score":8.3333333333333321}],"conditions":[],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":8.3333333333333321}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/big-skunk-korean_100x100_d1ba.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494200/b/big-skunk-korean__primary_5d4d.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Portland, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/big-skunk-korean","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Big Bud","subtitle":null,"slug":"big-bud","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/big-bud","symbol":"Bb","applink":"leafly://strain/big-bud"},{"name":"Skunk No. 1","subtitle":null,"slug":"skunk-1","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1","symbol":"Sk1","applink":"leafly://strain/skunk-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
