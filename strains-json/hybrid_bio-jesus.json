I purchased this indica-dominant hybrid sample from Denver Relief, being very impressed with the bag/jar appeal. The bud would simply appear light green with light orange hairs if it weren\u0027t completely covered in trichomes, giving it an almost white appearance. Despite some mild fox-tailing, the buds are pretty dense. Bio Jesus has a light and crisp aroma that smells of a vague floral scent with hints of tropical fruits. When the buds are broken into a sharp pine flavor emerges. The flavor is reminiscent of the smell, except for the overwhelming chest-expansion and nose-biting. The herbal and spicy smoke is not unpleasant, but certainly harsh even through a water filtered device. Vaporizing is the best way to experience the complex bouquet of Bio Jesus. The buzz is perhaps the best thing about this stain, however. After one good hit, even a seasoned smoker with a high tolerance will begin to feel the effects of this strong indica. This effective medicine may cause happiness, sleepiness, increased appetite, relaxation, and dry mouth. A fantastic choice for the evening or when being productive is not important.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/kJc1LyLawlfeJ9xGeaJMdVhCp9U=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fmstpXGgRuu3rPFHmtQHb_aviator-green.png"},{"id":1639867,"username":"chuckyunfat","text":"This is a great one for pain relief, I would imagine.

As of December 2013, 88% of American Catholics approve of how he\u0027s handling his role as head of the Catholic church, and even non-religious people admire Pope Francis\u0027 humility, his vow to live simply, his acts of compassion, and his love for and acceptance of folks from all walks of life. Dude was even a bar bouncer and a janitor before becoming a priest. What\u0027s not to like about him? \nWell, it turns out pope-in\u0027 ain\u0027t easy, and as much as I admire Pope Francis for being the pope-iest Pope to come along in decades, he holds one opinion that broke my little heathen heart. Last week, he condemned efforts to legalize cannabis, saying that limited attempts to legalize recreational drugs \"are not only highly questionable from a legislative standpoint, but they fail to produce the desired effects.\" He also added, \"the problem of drug use is not solved with drugs!\"\nPope Francis, I get where you\u0027re coming from. You\u0027ve previously spoken out against the evils of drug addiction, so I can see how you\u0027d be wary about cannabis legalization. However, cannabis is far less addictive (9-10%) than tobacco smokers (20%-30%), heroin users (23-25%), alcohol users (15%), and cocaine users (15%-20%), plus it has therapeutic and medical benefits.\nMaybe you need a little bit of cannabis education, Mr. Pope. For instance, did you know that cannabis and religion often go hand-in-hand? It\u0027s true! As a matter of fact, I\u0027ve got a list of nine strains that I think are right up your pious alley. Check out a few of these holy wonders and you\u0027ll see that cannabis isn\u0027t so bad, after all. \n1. 3 Kings\nIn the biblical sense, the Three Kings, also known as the biblical Magi or the three Wise Men (not to be confused with the \"Ooohhhhh a wise guy, eh?\" schtick of the Three Stooges) were a trio of foreigners who visited Jesus after his birth. They brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh because they had no idea what sort of thing newborn babies are into (in hindsight, burping cloths and a Baby Bjorn would have probably been more ideal than pungent tree resin, though the gold was a classy touch).\nWhat better way to commemorate the birth of baby Jesus than with the hybrid 3 Kings strain, known for its appropriately piney, pungent smell and its euphoric, happy effects. Pair it with Dream Star to simulate the Star of Bethlehem and you\u0027ve got yourself a pretty uplifting birthday celebration.\n2. Endless Sky\nIsn\u0027t heaven supposed to be some sort of Endless Sky where everyone lives on a fluffy cloud and gets free access to Backstreet Boys concerts? If so, let its indica counterpart bring you relaxation so you can dream about the day you get to meet your maker and high-five Him for inviting you through the pearly gates.\n3. Holy Grail Kush\nThe Holy Grail has had quite the heyday in pop culture, from Monty Python to Indiana Jones. There\u0027s no way you\u0027re not an Indiana Jones fan, Mr. Pope, so I strongly recommend you partake in this woody hybrid while commemorating the supposed vessel of the Last Supper with a viewing of the 1989 classic. Just know with Holy Grail Kush, you have chosen wisely.\n4. Jesus OG\nTry the indica named after Mr. JC himself, Jesus OG. Its citrus, earthy flavors and focused effects may channel the power of Christ to compel you to pair it with the hybrid Bio-Jesus, a euphoric hybrid that provides exceptional pain relief. That\u0027s double the Jesus in one session — think of it as hitting up church twice on the same Sunday.\n5. Soul Shine\nNot to be confused with Soul Glo (just let your soooooooooullllll glowwwwwwww!), Soul Shine is an arousing hybrid that will amplify your love for the man upstairs. (Not the dude who lives in the apartment above yours, I mean the actual Man Upstairs.) As Pope, I imagine you\u0027ve got one of the shiniest souls around, so this is a great option for someone with your sparkly innards.\n6. Lamb\u0027s Bread\nIn religious terms, lamb\u0027s bread is also known as sacramental bread, the body of Christ, altar bread, or Communion bread. It\u0027s used in the Christian ritual of the Eucharist/Holy Communion, where Christians accept a sacrament in the form of a piece of bread or cracker and a sip of wine or grape juice. In cannabis terms, Lamb\u0027s Bread is an earthy sativa that brings euphoric, uplifting, and creative effects. That sounds like a better Communion offering to me, don\u0027t you agree, Pope? Think of how much more amazing the church songs would be once the congregation gets their creative juices flowing (and we all know Christian hymns could use some oomph).    \n7. Trinity\nThe Trinity in Christian terms describes God as three expressions: the Father, the Son (aka Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. If God is a hybrid of these three, it\u0027s only fitting that the Trinity cannabis strain is also a hybrid (though I would hope God isn\u0027t as skunky-smelling). Try this one out for its trio of happy, uplifting, and energetic qualities and you\u0027ll think three is a magic number, indeed.\n8. Exodus Cheese\nThe Book of Exodus tells the story of Moses leading the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, where they wandered the desert for a ridiculous amount of time, subsisting on manna and miraculous water. They didn\u0027t even have any cheese, which to me is easily the biggest sacrifice (well, that and the whole \"wandering aimlessly through the dessert in search of a safe haven\" part). So pick up some of the hybrid Exodus Cheese, enjoy its sweet, cheesy flavors, and reflect on how thankful you are to eat cheese whenever you want instead of manna for the 40th day in a row (hopefully you\u0027re not lactose intolerant, Mr. Pope).\n9. God\u0027s Treat\n…or God\u0027s Gift, or God Bud. Whatever your preference, know that a number of strains are named after The Big Guy because a lot of growers are thankful that one of His creations was this incredible plant with therapeutic purposes. So whaddya say, Pope Francis, why don\u0027t you pick up some hybrid God\u0027s Treat and acknowledge that there are many positive aspects of cannabis that benefit millions of people around the world? After all, it must be stressful to be Pope, and this Treat can deliver relaxing and sleepy effects to help you rest up so you can continue to spread your goodwill to those in need…much how cannabis does.    ","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/12001344/9-holy-strains-that-can-change-the-popes-opinion-of-cannabis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/9-holy-strains-that-can-change-the-popes-opinion-of-cannabis"}],"reviewCount":81,"flavors":[{"name":"Chemical","score":40.721288515406165},{"name":"Earthy","score":39.660364145658257},{"name":"Diesel","score":24.194677871148457},{"name":"Citrus","score":16.5266106442577},{"name":"Flowery","score":16.228991596638654}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":100.89635854341736},{"name":"Euphoric","score":54.471288515406165},{"name":"Hungry","score":51.425070028011206},{"name":"Sleepy","score":48.75700280112045},{"name":"Happy","score":44.730392156862749}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":94.1701680672269},{"name":"Stress","score":60.007002801120443},{"name":"Inflammation","score":48.378851540616239},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":35.483193277310924},{"name":"Insomnia","score":35.157563025210081}],"conditions":[{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":30.017507002801121},{"name":"Anxiety","score":27.478991596638654},{"name":"Arthritis","score":22.468487394957982},{"name":"PTSD","score":21.764705882352938},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":15.395658263305322}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":42.44747899159664},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":12.013305322128851},{"name":"Dizzy","score":7.9061624649859938},{"name":"Headache","score":1.6071428571428572},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.6071428571428572}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/bio-jesus/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/bio-jesus/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bio-jesus_100x100_35fb.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/617870/b/bio-jesus__primary_9af9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bio-jesus_100x100_70ff.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/518605/b/bio-jesus__primary_22f4.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bio-jesus_100x100_9431.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/518000/b/bio-jesus__primary_7d56.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bio-jesus_100x100_0e28.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/503764/b/bio-jesus__primary_4e69.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bio-jesus_100x100_792f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/312104/b/bio-jesus__primary_aa76.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bio-jesus_100x100_93d6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/297527/b/bio-jesus__primary_62cd.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":9,"popularCities":["Chicago, IL","Addison, IL","Collinsville, IL","Effingham, IL","Elmwood Park, IL","Fulton, IL","Glendale, AZ","Homewood, IL","Joliet, IL","Justice, IL"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/bio-jesus","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.55555555555556/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Bio-Diesel","subtitle":null,"slug":"bio-diesel","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/bio-diesel","symbol":"Bio","applink":"leafly://strain/bio-diesel"},{"name":"Gumbo","subtitle":null,"slug":"gumbo","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/gumbo","symbol":"Gmb","applink":"leafly://strain/gumbo"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
