            "text": "Last year we brought you the spookiest strains to celebrate Halloween with; this year we\u2019re getting downright horrific. These strains are not for the faint of heart. Hideous creatures, the walking dead, and dismemberment are just a few of the topics we\u2019ll\u00a0cover. If you\u2019re into bone-chilling, shiver-inducing terror:\u00a0sit back, relax, and pull up one of these scary strains, a classic horror film, and enjoy the show!\nBrains Damage\nThis hybrid cross between Acapulco Mexican,\u00a0Mango, Hawaiian, and KC 36 won\u2019t leave you zombified, but it will come after your brains! Bred by Holland\u2019s KC Brains, its mellow, relaxed effects will give you a subtle energy akin to Romero\u2019s ghouls from Night of the Living Dead: subdued, slow, but totally content to seek\u00a0fresh flesh from dusk \u2018til dawn.\nFrankenstein\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that this indica inspires the sort of\u00a0creativity\u00a0needed to stitch together a creature from the parts and pieces of other living beings.\u00a0Frankenstein (or Fronkensteen, depending on whom you ask), will give you the inventive spirit to create a monster of your own, but it will quickly soothe you into a happy, relaxed lull that gives way to a good night\u2019s sleep. If you aren\u2019t feeling like harvesting body parts, your night would be just as well spent curling up on the couch with Mel Brooks\u2019 classic Young Frankenstein.\nBlack Dahlia\nAlthough this hybrid is lesser known than the infamous murder of the same name, its effects are no-less potent. While it won\u2019t leave your body severed and mutilated in a vacant lot, it will isolate and relieve chronic pain, an irony that isn\u2019t lost on us. Although this hybrid is known to produce euphoria, its effects lean strongly indica, and is best used for a Halloween movie marathon.\nWhite Zombie\nWhether you\u2019re a diehard metal fan\u00a0or just enjoy the plight of the undead, this cerebrally-focused hybrid has everything you need to stimulate your brains(sssss)! This strain is truly multi-faceted: it will get your creative juices flowing\u00a0while simultaneously relieving stress and depression.\nVoodoo\nUnlike its namesake, this strain\u2019s history isn\u2019t shrouded in mystery and mysticism. Have an unprecedented case of the Halloween blues? This strain is also know to crush depression, fatigue, and stress, leaving you ready to dance the night away\u00a0or perform ritualistic Haitian Vodou, whichever lights your cermonial candle.\nphoto credit: Brett Kiger via photopin cc",

It is noticeably darker in color than any other bud that sits next to it.\r\nThe taste is almost cigar-like, with a smoky strong taste that is not in any way like skunk or 'normal' bud.
