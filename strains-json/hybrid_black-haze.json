See pictures and detailed reviews  on my blog - AgingEnt.com -- Brand: OMG Sykes\nStrain: Black Haze\nSativa-dominant Hybrid--\nPotency Analysis: TTL 22.23% THC 22.17% CBD 0.05%\n -- \nPackaging: 5.25\" x 3.25\" orange and clear mylar-backed plastic rip-top zip-top bag\nCost: $15/gram\n -- This beautiful marijuana smells so deliciously good.  It\u0027s super pungent, a deep earthy smell.  There\u0027s sharp woody smells like pine planks in the sun, and resinous, rich smells.  I sat with a couple pieces of the smaller nugget in my fingers and smelling them.  I would put some pressure on the flower and twist a bit, to release all those beautiful terpenes.  I had these basically pressed right up into my nostrils just immersing myself in this majestic scent.\n -- \nThe flavor was not quite as overwhelming as the smell.  It was a great flavor, just not very strong.  The resinous, piney flavor came through very lightly in the bottom of the mouth and the earthy, pungent smell didn\u0027t really carry over to the smoke as much as I\u0027d like.  \n -- \nWhat I\u0027m saying is, If the smell was a [7] intensity, the flavor was a [4] intensity.\n -- \nThe high is delightfully stoney - a bit dumb and lost.  I keep double-checking to make sure I did that thing I was supposed to do a few minutes ago, then forgot what I was supposed to be doing then.  Hell, I can\u0027t even keep track of the tense within which I\u0027m writing this post!  \n -- \nThere\u0027s a mild body effect, some loosening of joints and mild relaxation, but mostly this is has head high.  Overall, this outstanding looking and smelling flower is a great sativa, delicious and heady.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/YEN1LqXiYCOvWiFhmP-4p67iqDM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fY9fB9qHySLml8016ysgJ_goggles-green.png"},{"id":1362524,"username":"jesfos","text":"I originally gave this a 2 star. I changed my mind. This does make me sleepy. not good for day time use as I was told, but it has a nice head high.
