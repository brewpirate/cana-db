            "text": "The fortitude demonstrated by cancer patients and survivors is truly remarkable. With numerous reviewers on Leafly using cannabis to combat the effects of various types of cancer, chemotherapy, and related medications, we\u2019re constantly inspired by the positivity, bravery and determination that shines through their stories.\nWe honor these individuals by sharing a small sampling of the strains that have helped cancer patients deal with the physical, emotional, and psychological effects of their condition as they fight toward joining the ranks of hundreds of thousands of cancer survivors across the nation and around the world.\n\n\u00a0AK-48\n\u201cAK-48 has helped me in so many ways with respect to my cancer. My appetite has resumed as normal, I sleep GREAT, less depression, moments of bliss, less pain and increased level of hope for survival. It is, without a doubt, my personal favorite.\u201d \u2013Good-juju\n\u00a0Ingrid\n\u201cThe first strain I tried for chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting and lack of appetite. After first use I went from nearly heaving at the thought of any food to craving \u2013 and eating \u2013 Mexican food (peppers and all).\u201d \u2013gobby\n\u00a0ACDC\n\u201cNo brain fog, no paranoia, and doesn\u2019t make me want to eat all of the things. I am in remission from cancer and this helps with remaining painful side effects.\u201d \u2013kamina\n\u00a0Harlequin\n\u201cThis is, by far, one of my favorite medicinal strains\u2026there is a complimentary THC content and effect that I find helpful as opposed to purely CBD strains. Mix it with some Sour Diesel (not enough to kill the CBD effects), vape away, and it\u2019s my \u2018morning coffee\u2019 when on chemo.\u201d \u2013bravo2kilo\n\u00a0Blueberry Kush\n\u201cEvery time I get this strain, I specifically save it for my friend with cancer. She says it\u2019s her favorite for the pain.\u201d \u2013HebiMidori\n\n\u00a0Flo\n\u201cMy left breast was diagnosed a couple months ago with breast cancer. Flo has me feeling better than I have in the two months\u2026my body is relaxed. I did not realize how much tension I have been holding. The future looks better and easier at the moment. Wow.\u201d \u2013dataqueen11\n\u00a0Mr. Nice\n\u201cUsing this for my back pain and for my golden retriever who has cancer. Works great for both of us!\u201d \u2013dyeager105\n\u00a0Jack the Ripper\n\u201cAbsolutely fantastic sativa! One of the best strains I\u2019ve had in the past 10 years. The high THC content will knock your socks off and the high lasts for 3-4 hours solid. I have brain cancer so I deal with different health issues\u2026and this strain works extremely well controlling pain, nausea, and vertigo.\u201d \u2013jfu5129\n\u00a0Blueberry\n\u201cSuper relaxing, pain relieving, joyful, floaty. I am a cancer survivor, have fibro, serious anxiety, and advanced degenerative disc disease and 17 herniated discs in my spine paired with scoliosis, and I feel like a carefree kid.\u201d \u2013DabaDharma\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Chemo\n\u201cMy mom is going through chemotherapy\u2026She suffers from extreme appetite loss, nausea and abdominal discomfort from the chemotherapy. She says this strain is incredible for nausea, probably the best she has ever used and induced a great appetite for her instantly. I haven\u2019t seen her in that much relief regarding nausea in ages.\u201d \u2013rachels95\n\u00a0Black Jack\n\u201cThis strain has been like a little miracle in my life. Cancer treatment related pain keeps me from sleeping most nights. I literally was pain free for the entire evening allowing me to finally sleep for the first time in weeks. I\u2019m grateful for Black Jack!!!\u201d \u2013karmagirl\n\u00a0Sour Diesel\n\u201cI love this strain a lot. I find myself in my own little creative world, giggling, always forgetting what I was doing then remembering\u2026zoning out to music by Soundgarden (\u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d)\u2026I always smoke with my dad because he gets real funny when he\u2019s medicated. He has cancer so it\u2019s better seeing him happy then depressed and in pain. Speaking of, I think he is lost in the kitchen wondering about which entr\u00e9e he should devour next. I\u2019m gonna go stop him before he eats us out of house and home, or most likely, I will end up eating a tub of ice cream along side him.\u201d \u2013Thecode007",

            "text": "Black Friday is here! For most it signals flash sales, holiday hysteria, and American consumerism at its finest. It serves as the official kick off to the holiday spending season, with retailers preparing all year for the sales that are designed to bring them out of the red and into the black.\nFor others, like myself, it has become a day of rest,\u00a0filled with leftover turkey sandwiches, college football, and of course cannabis. So, if you are shopping for the cannabis connoisseur on your holiday list you may be better served giving God\u2019s Gift instead of waiting in the lines at Best Buy.\nWhether you are wrestling for the season\u2019s hottest toy or just for the TV remote, these strains will help you get through Black Friday with a smile on your face.\n\u00a0Flo\nWhile being funneled through your favorite retail locations all day, you will find it refreshing to just go with the Flo.

After a day of questionable purchasing decisions, this Jack Herer cross is a perfect solution to elevated stress levels and the fatigue of repetitious credit card swipes. \u00a0\n\u00a0Mr. Nice\nAfter a morning spent dodging the masses of crazed consumers and snarky sales associates, you\u2019ll be relieved to introduce yourself to Mr. Nice. No coaxing or begging to check the stockroom is needed as this strain will be waiting to shower you with its gift of relaxing euphoria. The sweet pungent aroma will turn any sour attitude around and return your holiday cheer.\u00a0\n\u00a0Black Diamond\nWe all have loved ones who are impossible to shop for. They tend to be picky and often have expensive tastes. For those finicky friends, Black Diamond might be the answer you\u2019re looking for. After searching high and low for a particular gift, you may be looking to relax that pain in your backside, or maybe you just like the way the glittery trichomes sparkle like gemstones. Either way Black Diamond provides a pungent mix of Blackberry\u2019s sweetness and Diamond OG\u2019s indica effects that are sure to ease your troubles and help you unwind.",

            "text": "This is by far one of my favorite strains of cannabis of all time. For the entire weight of the flower after trimmed and cured... the sheer wieght of the trichomes account for a large % of the exact weight. It's oder is not changed upon combustion and you exhale the same oderferous flavor that is inhaled and not often is that achived, namely with hybrids. This has a slew of genetics that will dazzle the entire cannabis loving community- consisting of one of the most poweful strains in the world on BOTH sides of its genetics its no wonder where the majority of its power comes from and that mighty strain is Northern lights. You have a doezens of lines of champions Hazes with a touch of the finest skunk#1, afghani SA, a Canadian developed H called the Ortega Hybrid and not the least the strain to make the Haze in the breed shine to a explosive climax... Hashplant is part of the bloodline as well. This is a hybrid in every sense of the word... yet its undeniable that the indica in this creatures blood is strong, the sativa is stronger. Thus couch-lock is staved off yet you have a tranquil and serene effect that leads to defence against snxiety, depression, insomnia, lack of appatite and lack of creativity and ability to enjoy possative experiences. Essentially this strain offers all effects of indica and sativa in a very evenly blended package in every way. Its very strong but very smooth. Its very heavy in it flowering yet not overly dense and this allows for THC to develope in  360 degree platforms instead of just one side of a hard bud such as Stonehenge or T-Rex. So Though not rock hard like many ppl say, it is a triple calyx producer and the CBN is very high as well. Its gift from hashplant but moreso Northern lights... a couple bowl of this and you mise well have smoked a bowl of fine hash. This is a champion among all strains.",

When the smallish buds were broken apart the scent of pine & citrus was released & lots of clear crystal trichomes could be seen. My Indica strain had 17% THC & at once made me happy/uplifted.
