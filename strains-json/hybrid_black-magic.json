            "text": "As the clock ticked into the fourth quarter of last night\u2019s NBA Finals showdown between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors, ABC cut to a commercial break \u2014 and aired what might be remembered as a landmark ad for the cannabis industry.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBlack Magic potting soil\u2019s 30-second \u201cGrowers\u201d spot features twentysomething hipsters growing plants in urban storerooms, closets, and \u201cunder the cover of darkness\u201d with specialized lighting. \u201cThey seek perfection on a level that would drive lesser souls to madness,\u201d intones the voiceover artist in a deep, truck-driving rumble. The bit ends with a shot of a badass dude in a grow room and the catchphrase, \u201cBlack Magic: Yield to no one.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYield.\u201d See what they did there?\u00a0\n\nThe plants featured in the spot were not cannabis. It looked like the tatted growers were raising leafy greens, tomatoes, and sage. But the atmospherics were unmistakable. Those folks were growing indoors with lights, looking for production from their soil \u2014 which, by the way, is available at The Home Depot only in the strategic markets of Washington (legal), Colorado (legal), and Michigan (medically legal).\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t the first wink-nudge cannabis-related ad on network TV \u2014 we\u2019d give that distinction to Jack in the Box\u2019s \u201cStoner Dude\u201d ad from 2009 \u2014 but it may be the first network spot aimed at cannabis growers.\u00a0\nKimberly Chisholm, marketing leader with Hawthorne Gardening, the Port Washington, NY-based company that produces Black Magic soil products, said the ad aired once in West Coast and Rocky Mountain markets during the game last night. It wasn\u2019t a cheap buy. \u201cWe just launched the brand a couple months ago, and we were looking for a way to reach a young, male, early-adopter demographic,\u201d she told Leafly.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe know people who grow hydroponically are interested in yield and love being able to customize\u201d their grow setups, Chisholm added. Black Magic is one of the first companies to offer coco coir mix, a favorite substrate for cannabis growers, through The Home Depot. \u201cThey\u2019re the largest gardening seller in the U.S., and they were looking to try something new. It\u2019s a great fit for us, especially in markets like Seattle and Boulder, where hydroponic growing is fostering a whole new community.\u201d\u00a0\nLast night\u2019s game drew monster ratings in Northern California, where fans tuned in to see if their beloved Warriors could clinch their second straight NBA title. They didn\u2019t \u2014 but Black Magic saw some massive brand exposure and, perhaps, a little uptick in potting soil sales. How\u2019s that for yield?",

Smoked extremely well through vape (looking forward to proper b rips). Instant head and body effects, really nice and much more toward the Indica side. Very solid and not couchy at all. Reminds me a bit of Silver Tip but a lot more cerebral. Should have purchased more!",

Don\u2019t be scared of black magic it smells and tastes like mulched leather with hints of dark fruit. A strong spell of relaxation in body and mind. Very euphoric and zoned. Fell into a deep sleep after munching out. I was wondering wtf happened when I woke up the next day to see all my food gone like it disappeared last night. Puff! Black magic. \nI\u2019d get again and recommend it.",
