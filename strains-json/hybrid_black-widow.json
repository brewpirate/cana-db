This particular monster takes shape as a heavy-hitting sativa. It\u0027s the perfect choice for a night filled with all sorts of tomfoolery. The only thing Green Goblin can truly scare is the pumpkin pie at your office Halloween party. \nPhoto credits: madlyinlovewithlife; Felix42 contra la censura; the cherry blossom girl; ihave3kids; Scott Kinmartin; elviskennedy via photopin cc","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/12001447/boo-leaflys-top-5-strains-for-halloween-night.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/boo-leaflys-top-5-strains-for-halloween-night"}],"reviewCount":276,"flavors":[{"name":"Pungent","score":15.530821917808218},{"name":"Ammonia","score":12.979452054794521},{"name":"Chemical","score":12.979452054794521},{"name":"Sweet","score":10.667808219178083},{"name":"Earthy","score":9.1267123287671232}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":48.082191780821915},{"name":"Happy","score":47.106164383561648},{"name":"Euphoric","score":42.534246575342465},{"name":"Talkative","score":33.356164383561641},{"name":"Creative","score":23.065068493150683}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":24.229452054794521},{"name":"Depression","score":21.421232876712327},{"name":"Insomnia","score":19.554794520547944},{"name":"Headaches","score":16.506849315068493},{"name":"Pain","score":7.9280821917808222}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":22.654109589041095},{"name":"PTSD","score":20.890410958904109},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":14.434931506849315},{"name":"Migraines","score":4.2808219178082192},{"name":"Arthritis","score":2.2773972602739727}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dizzy","score":13.938356164383562},{"name":"Anxious","score":13.321917808219178},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":10.753424657534246},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":5.0856164383561646},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.36986301369863}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/black-widow_100x100_efe9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1005364/b/black-widow__primary_6df6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/black-widow_100x100_88df.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/650357/b/black-widow__primary_6124.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/black-widow_100x100_6353.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/600925/b/black-widow__primary_e70b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/black-widow_100x100_b051.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/600982/b/black-widow__primary_6dc3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/black-widow_100x100_1a31.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/601170/b/black-widow__primary_8636.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/black-widow_100x100_1e90.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/601169/b/black-widow__primary_9e5b.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":77,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Calgary, AB","Vancouver, BC","Detroit, MI","Edmonton, AB","Halifax, NS","Montréal, QC","Toronto, ON","Brampton, ON","Eugene, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/black-widow","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.14130434782609/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"South American","subtitle":null,"slug":"south-american","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/south-american","symbol":"Sam","applink":"leafly://strain/south-american"},{"name":"South Indian Sativa","subtitle":null,"slug":"south-indian","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/south-indian","symbol":"Sin","applink":"leafly://strain/south-indian"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
