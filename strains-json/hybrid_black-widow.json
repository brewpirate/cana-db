            "text": "Happy Halloween, Leafly readers! In order to help you celebrate, we\u2019ve complied a brief list of our top five spooky strains. Our only advice? Try not to eat too much candy, and you might want to think twice before braving that haunted corn maze.\nHere are our picks:\u00a0\n1.\u00a0Zombie OG\n\nZombie OG is a classic choice for those who\u2019d like to show their holiday cheer with a movie marathon and a personal pack of mini candy bars. More Shaun of the Dead than 28 Days Later, Zombie OG is a potent indica that will leave you brainless and catatonic.\u00a0\n2.\u00a0Durban Poison\n\nThis spooky strain has truly mind-altering effects. Durban Poison is a surefire sativa, energizing consumers while creating an almost out of body sensation. One word of caution: be wary of the monsters out on Halloween night; this strain might make them seem just a little too realistic.\u00a0\u00a0\n3.\u00a0Jack the Ripper\n\nWhile the Jack the Ripper is perhaps the most frightening in our cast of Halloween strains, strength and stealth are the only things this Jack has in common with the real deal. Overall this hybrid is quite happy and uplifting. With all the giggling you\u2019ll be doing, you probably won\u2019t have the willpower to hunt for potential victims.\u00a0\n4.\u00a0Black Widow\n\nBe careful, because this strain sure can bite. Naturally high in THC, you can feel Black Widow\u2019s psychoactive effects almost immediately after your first taste. Novice consumers should start out tentatively;\u00a0much like its namesake, this hybrid doesn\u2019t mess around.\u00a0\n5.\u00a0Green Goblin\n\nFrom the much hated Spiderman nemesis to the ever so meticulous bankers in Harry Potter, goblins have taken on many forms over\u00a0the ages. This particular monster takes shape as a heavy-hitting sativa. It's the perfect choice for a night filled with all sorts of tomfoolery. The only thing Green Goblin\u00a0can truly scare is the pumpkin pie at your office Halloween party.\u00a0\nPhoto credits: madlyinlovewithlife; Felix42 contra la censura;\u00a0the cherry blossom girl;\u00a0ihave3kids;\u00a0Scott Kinmartin;\u00a0elviskennedy via photopin cc",

When Shantibaba left GHS and found Mr. Nice Seeds, he took the original Brazilian sativa mother and South Indian indica-dominant hybrid father with him to recreate his world renowned White Widow seeds. Because GHS and others were selling seeds with the name White Widow, he changed the name to Black Widow to create a distinction between them. Black Widow is now considered by many to be the only &ldquo;true&rdquo; White Widow available in seed form, as Mr. Nice is the lone seed breeder to possess the original parental genetics.</p>\n",
