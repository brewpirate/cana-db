    "description": "<p>Blackberry Dream y Elev8 Seeds is a fruity hybrid cross that might surprise you. Not to be confused with the many <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-dream\">Blue Dream</a> &ldquo;Dream&rdquo; crosses out there, Blackberry Dream is the offspring of <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kimbo-kush\">Kimbo Kush</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/super-silver-haze\">Super Silver Haze</a>. This generous plant produces a massive yield of glittering emerald-colored buds that reek of jam and spice. The strain flowers over 9-10 weeks and generally benefits from a little extra time on the stalk. Mind your dosage while enjoying this strain. The hybrid genetics begin with a heady sativa-dominant bent, but can get heavier on the body with continued consumption. &nbsp;</p>\n",
