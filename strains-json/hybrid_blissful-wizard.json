            "text": "My first time experience with \"blissful Wizard.\" Although it's classified as a hybrid with 50% indica and 50% setiva, it's head-high happyness brought me to an energetic, social state where my anxiety was drained from my head and filled up with reason, understanding of my surroundings, willingness to learn, and a colorful insight. After inhaling the smoke I noticed a sweet, citrus flavor come on and it left a lemony and earthy flavor after the exhale (it's delicious). Soon, I became happy and wanted to take advantage of that moment so it brought me to the garden where my girlfriend and I began watering and I began picking vegetables and weeding- It was nice, it brought me closer to what was important to me and it helped me become comfortable with who I am by obliterating my idea of self worth and seeing through life's eyes in a much meaningful way. \"Awareness of awareness\"",
