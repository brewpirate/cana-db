After inhaling the smoke I noticed a sweet, citrus flavor come on and it left a lemony and earthy flavor after the exhale (it\u0027s delicious). Soon, I became happy and wanted to take advantage of that moment so it brought me to the garden where my girlfriend and I began watering and I began picking vegetables and weeding- It was nice, it brought me closer to what was important to me and it helped me become comfortable with who I am by obliterating my idea of self worth and seeing through life\u0027s eyes in a much meaningful way. \"Awareness of awareness\"","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1608899,"username":"stelfo64","text":"Probably my favorite strain right now.
