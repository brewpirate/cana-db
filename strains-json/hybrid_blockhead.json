            "text": "Because every day must be deemed a holiday (however pithy) in this digital world, July 12th was \u201cCow Appreciation Day,\u201d which sounds udderly ridiculous until you realize what our bovine buddies have contributed to the cannabis moo-vement. In addition to a number of cow-themed strains such as Alpha Cow, Madcow, Purple Cow, and Afghan Cow, our comely cattle companions have also inspired an oft-used phrase used in many a Leafly review: \u201cHoly cow!\u201d\nIn honor of these dearly beloved domesticated ungulates, here are eight cannabis strains that inspired Leafly reviewers to exclaim \u201cHoly cow\u201d that I\u2019ve helpfully paired with a corresponding gif.\n\u00a0\u00a0Durban Poison\n\u201choly cow I\u2019m flying. no such thing as stress or anxiety with this strain.\u201d \u2013 chaosanon\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Blockhead\n\u201cI hit some of this from a bong along with some crazy dank lemon skunk and then vaped some of this blockhead (all with a friend) and holy cow i was flying high as a kite.\u201d \u2013 chroniccannabisconsumsr\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Kandy Kush\n\u201cHoly cow was a privilege to try out this strain. [\u2026] Probably the smoothest that I have ever smoked. Was like a dream and to boot the exquisite candy floss flavour it brings is unbelievable!\u201d \u2013 TheBigGreenGiant\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Super Green Crack\n\u201cHoly cow. [\u2026] Never felt more energetic in my life. Just felt like an energy to just get up and start doing shit. \u2013 hkim823\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Sage N Sour\n\u201cfirst commercially grow strain I\u2019ve ever had, that being said HOLY COW! I ripped three huge hits from a bong and didn\u2019t feel much yet so I killed the bowl, then it hit me \u2026. I had to sit down for a sec and as the high progressed I got more and more energetic and super trippy I dont know how else to describe it but like being in. a 3D movie it was weird and then the world got flat and 2D like it was amazing then as I was coming down I felt like a super hero being ably to switch between reality,2D ,And more real than real 3D movie feeling\u201d \u2013 COMetalHead\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Lemon Haze\n\u201cHoly COW. [\u2026] I got it last night, after I had already been smoking so I didn\u2019t truly know its potential. I woke up this morning and loaded it up, about 2 hours before I had to go to work, with my last hit about 30 minutes before work. It is a GREAT get up and go, but be warned, you might [not] comprehend what you [are] getting up and going to. [\u2026] It was a fun experience though. :3\u201d \u2013 thewhitewidow\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0God Bud\n\u201c\u2026I tried this concentrate and HOLY FREAKNG COW! This is the best indica. I was immediately at ease and calm. Great for relaxing at home.\u201d \u2013 ariellm91\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Pandora\u2019s Box\n\u201c\u2026My new favorite strain. Holy cow man. [\u2026] After decades doing this, I\u2019m higher than I have been in recent memory. Crazy good stuff\u2026\u201d \u2013 MrFadedGlory",

            "text": "Blockhead is a cross between an unknown strain and Sweet Tooth.  I get a really nice, calming head effect with this strain and little in the way of body effects until the comedown, which leaves you a little tired.  I find this to be great for night time use.  It really helps with de-stressing after a hard day and inability to sleep at night.  \r\nI would not recommend this strain for any tasks which require full use of your mental facilities lol.  While definitely euphoric, the high left me in a bit of a mental fog.  Also leaves you very giggly when used in a social setting.  This stuff makes me dumb as a box of rocks and laughing at just about everything - very much like Beavis and Butthead.  ",
