Great for pain and anxiety and really good for ADHD-ers like me who need a break from racing thoughts.  Puts me in a light, happy mood.  If you want to sleep, it'll get you there if you decide to go with it, but if you aren't ready to hit the sack, it won't knock you out.  This strain lets you be the boss.  Oh, and NO MUNCHIES!  Great if you aren't interested in weight gain. Did I mention the aphrodisiac effects?  Yup....there's that, too!",
