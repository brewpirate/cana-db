That does mean that the come down leans toward sleepy, but for me, it's more like... coming home from the beach. Relaxed, maybe a bit yawny but definitely not sleepy... just blissfully chill. ",

            "text": "What can blue do for you? \nI read it was a creeper, and like most of us, know the parents very well. So I decided to go out on a limb and hit it like I've smoked it for a while and throw first time caution into the wind.\nIt smells like meh. If you give any random stoner a whiff, they will say meh.\nInhale was 10/10 smooth, and that surprised me. Exhale sweet and a possible berry note.\nThis burns very well also. (Smokey Point) Possibly too well? Is that even a thing?\n5 min in, feeling zero head, but feels like an angel with nice hands is rubbing my shoulders.\nJust a minutes later, realized my spirits seem lifted to a nice all is right in the world feeling.\nSlight neck and spine @ 10 min in, with head an every so slight haze that replaced a clear head... but now they seem in battle.\nI've reached the climax right at 15 min. Wow, they were spot on.\nI do have the slight haze now, but still could function @ 100% even in a place of work.\nThis is a very chill high, and really loving it. Concept of time still there. This is going into my rotation for sure. Zero bad effects. This would be great for someone with flower anxiety for sure.\n4.5/5 stars (I'm picky about heaviness in my neck area, color me strange)",
