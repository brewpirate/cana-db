Starting in the 19th¬†century, blues formed in black communities of the deep south and has strong roots in African musical traditions. Early blues songs were accompanied by lyrics recounting experiences of racial discrimination and other similar hardships faced by black Americans. The genre has persisted through the years, often being combined with elements of jazz, soul, rock, spirituals, and R\u0026B.\n\nWhatever form it takes, the blues is a genre that grabs you by the heart and demands an emotional response. Below, enjoy five impactful blues albums with our recommended strains and tune in to your emotional center.\nSouthern Avenue by Southern Avenue\n(Spotify)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Bluniverse\nSouthern Avenue released its lively self-titled album in 2017 and burst onto the blues scene with a refreshing style.

For some of us, it is. Alcohol can loosen us up, make us chatty and animated, and wash away social anxiety. It‚Äôs also often readily available at social occasions. Meanwhile, many people avoid cannabis use during social events‚Äîfor one thing, it‚Äôs generally not served, and for another, many can recall a time cannabis made them paranoid or sleepy at a party, and don‚Äôt want to have that happen again.\n\nLuckily, with the right strains you can avoid the unwanted effects mentioned above. We used the advanced filters in Leafly‚Äôs strain explorer to get started, sorting to include strains with the happiest, most talkative highs, and to exclude any strains that make users anxious, paranoid, or sleepy. (If only alcohol‚Äôs drawbacks were so easy to filter out, am I right?)\nWe‚Äôve curated the resultant list with our in-house expertise, vetting all suggestions against our own experiences and ensuring there‚Äôs a pick for every type of party. Attendees heading to any social occasion will find something below.\nAnd the awards for the best party cannabis strains go to‚Ä¶\nChocolope\nStrain type: Sativa\nBest for: All occasions.\nDNA Genetics developed Chocolope by crossing¬†Chocolate Thai¬†with¬†Cannalope Haze to create their homage to the super-popular Chocolate strains of the 1980s. The hefty¬†sativa¬†buds give¬†earthy, sweet¬†coffee¬†flavors that provide a dreamy, cerebral effect. It‚Äôs known around the Leafly office as ‚Äúthe party strain,‚Äù and for good reason‚Äîit‚Äôs basically impossible to be unhappy or introverted with such a feel-good high.\n\nWhite Russian\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Dinner parties.\nOriginally created by Dutch breeders Serious Seeds, White Russian is a cross of two legendary strains,¬†White Widow¬†and¬†AK-47. An indica-dominant hybrid, it won the¬†High Times¬†Cannabis Cup ‚ÄúBest Overall‚Äù¬†in 1996. White Russian is an extremely fragrant plant, and with a flavor that is smooth and spicy with undertones of skunk and earth, and its high is quite cerebral (especially for an indica-dominant strain), making it great for conversation with those around you.\nTangie\nStrain type: Sativa\nBest for: Cocktail parties.\nAnother fave among the Leafly crew, particularly for group gatherings after work, Tangie is a fantastic offering from DNA Genetics in Amsterdam. This strain is a remake of sorts of the popular version of¬†Tangerine Dream¬†that was sought-after in the 1990s, with genetics derived from a cross of¬†California Orange¬†and a¬†Skunk¬†hybrid. Its citrus heritage is the most evident in its refreshing tangerine aroma.\nBlue Goo\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Friends and family gatherings.\nBlue Goo is a sativa-dominant hybrid that‚Äôs a cross between the famous hybrid¬†Blue Dream¬†and indica¬†Afgoo. A moderate to high potency yields uplifting effects that are standard for sativas, but not excessively energetic thanks to Afgoo‚Äôs contribution as well as the mellow nature of Blue Dream. This strain is appropriate for day or nighttime consumption and provides smooth smoke and berry flavor.\n\nSour Lemon OG\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Birthday parties.\nBred by Emerald Triangle Seeds, Sour Lemon OG is a sativa-dominant¬†hybrid¬†cross between¬†California Sour¬†and¬†Lemon OG. This 65%¬†sativa¬†strain is named after its aromatic sour smell with recognizable notes of¬†lemon,¬†lime, and¬†apple. Sour Lemon OG elevates the mind and body simultaneously, making this a natural go-to strain for¬†celebrations, social engagements, or even just a busy day.\nBlue Diesel\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Happy hour.\nDaughter of indica-dominant¬†Blueberry¬†and sativa-dominant¬†NYC Diesel, Blue Diesel (also known as Blue City Diesel) falls slightly on the indica side of things with a pleasant,¬†moderate- to long-lasting body buzz (perfect if you want to extend the happy for more than an hour). Thanks to its Blueberry genetics, this flower emanates a light berry aroma that is smooth, expansive, and fast-acting. This strain is optimal for daytime use, and relaxes the consumer in social settings without putting you to sleep.\nPez\nStrain type: Indica\nBest for: Cannabis-focused parties.\nPez is an¬†indica¬†daughter of¬†Afghani¬†and Pakistani strains. These¬†sweet, frosty buds offer the¬†relaxation¬†typical of indicas without the drowsiness, making the strain great for daytime use.¬†We recommend this one as a shareable contribution to any 420-friendly gathering‚Äîit‚Äôs also on our list of the Top 100 Must-Try Strains, meaning it will be a particularly popular addition to any event with open cannabis consumption.\n\nOrange Bud\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Hosting.\nMatching plenty of social energy with a dose of subtle relaxation, this strain is perfect for gatherings where you‚Äôre in charge and want to stay upbeat and level-headed. First bred in 1980s by Dutch Passion, Orange Bud is a combination of two members of the 100%¬†Skunk¬†family. With bright orange hairs coating the surface, it showcases scents of orange and nectarine.\nBlueberry Headband\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Parties you don‚Äôt want to attend.\nSeveral renditions of the Blueberry Headband hybrid are known to exist, but the original Blueberry Headband from NorCal‚Äôs Emerald Triangle Seeds is the most well-known. It‚Äôs a 50/50 indica-sativa hybrid that smells of diesel, berries and pepper, and it produces a perfectly balanced high with a nice cerebral rush and relaxing body effects. This is great for staying sufficiently present while mentally floating high above any social event you wish you didn‚Äôt have to attend (think work parties, baby showers, and so on).\nBanana Kush\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Potlucks.\nThis legendary West Coast strain crosses¬†Ghost OG¬†and¬†Skunk Haze¬†to create an¬†indica-dominant¬†hybrid¬†that tastes and smells like a bushel of fresh¬†bananas (and will whet your appetite if there‚Äôs food around). Although it leans towards an¬†indica genetically, the effects are balanced by the¬†Haze‚Äôs¬†mellow¬†sativa¬†buzz that provides a¬†relaxed¬†sense of¬†euphoria.¬†Banana Kush also help its consumers remain¬†talkative¬†in social settings.\n\nDurban Cookies\nStrain type: Sativa\nBest for: Loud parties.\nDurban Cookies is the¬†Durban Poison-dominant¬†phenotype¬†of¬†GSC. Known for its invigorating mental energy and body buzz, Durban Cookies offers a more energizing experience, making this sativa-dominant strain a top choice throughout the day and into the evening, particularly if you‚Äôre headed to a high-energy event where you‚Äôll be surrounded by music, people, and movement.\nBubblegum Kush\nStrain type: Indica\nBest for: Low-key get-togethers.\nThis strain is for laid-back social situations; it‚Äôll leave you relaxed and comfy on any given couch, but also chatty and ready to hang with whoever sits down next to you. An 80% indica strain from Bulldog Seeds in the Netherlands, Bubblegum Kush is a cross between¬†Bubble Gum¬†and an undisclosed Kush, and has a satisfyingly sour smell and flavor.\nStrawberry\nStrain type: Sativa\nBest for: Being a plus-one.\nOriginally bred in the Netherlands, Strawberry is a mostly sativa cannabis strain with a pungent fruity scent and uplifting effects. Consumers prone to anxiety choose Strawberry for its stress-relieving qualities without the jarring paranoia common among high-THC strains (which makes it great for small talk with people you don‚Äôt know). Comfortable and relaxing, Strawberry brings with it a hearty dose of physical and mental ease.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22124021/best-cannabis-strains-for-parties.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/the-13-best-cannabis-strains-for-parties"}],"reviewCount":494,"flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","score":36.4057239057239},{"name":"Diesel","score":29.734848484848484},{"name":"Berry","score":24.305555555555557},{"name":"Sweet","score":11.132154882154882},{"name":"Pungent","score":9.7222222222222214}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":72.72727272727272},{"name":"Uplifted","score":62.689393939393945},{"name":"Relaxed","score":62.37373737373737},{"name":"Euphoric","score":46.170033670033668},{"name":"Energetic","score":35.774410774410775}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":36.4057239057239},{"name":"Stress","score":34.385521885521889},{"name":"Pain","score":23.863636363636367},{"name":"Fatigue","score":16.435185185185183},{"name":"Insomnia","score":16.035353535353536}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":35.858585858585862},{"name":"PTSD","score":17.697811447811446},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":11.742424242424242},{"name":"PMS","score":7.65993265993266},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.1877104377104377}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":31.902356902356903},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":9.5749158249158253},{"name":"Dizzy","score":8.9856902356902353},{"name":"Anxious","score":8.712121212121211},{"name":"Paranoid","score":7.44949494949495}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-diesel_100x100_f27f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002284/b/blue-diesel__primary_8e54.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-diesel_100x100_756a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002283/b/blue-diesel__primary_0c93.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-diesel_100x100_2984.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000745/b/blue-diesel__primary_3fb7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-diesel_100x100_cd50.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/708498/b/blue-diesel__primary_d0c6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-diesel_100x100_d573.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/665610/b/blue-diesel__primary_f143.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-diesel_100x100_b4ae.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/632112/b/blue-diesel__primary_c7a7.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":129,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Toronto, ON","Vancouver, BC","Montr√©al, QC","Los Angeles, CA","San Diego, CA","Seattle, WA","Spokane, WA","Calgary, AB","Eugene, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-diesel","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.40080971659919/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Blueberry","subtitle":null,"slug":"blueberry","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/blueberry","symbol":"Bry","applink":"leafly://strain/blueberry"},{"name":"NYC Diesel","subtitle":null,"slug":"nyc-diesel","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/nyc-diesel","symbol":"Nyc","applink":"leafly://strain/nyc-diesel"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
