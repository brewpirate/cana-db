It's very hard to describe the taste ; but my best description would be blueberry /purple kush/ cheese blend . The high is very nice body high and a powerful \"head\" high. I recommend this to patients who suffer from depression , pain, anxiety and insomnia to name a few. There's so called \"top shelf herb\" advertised everywhere but this along with a choice few others is the top of the top",
