You think about counteracting your discomfort with some cannabis, but which strains will offer the best digestive aid?\nDon\u0027t worry, we\u0027re hear to help! Here are some strains to ease your aching tummy after a huge holiday meal.\n \n   Thin Mint GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\nThis hybrid cross has some pretty impressive origins – we all know the famous GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) of legendary status. Cross that with Durban Poison from a continent away in South Africa, and you’ve got a powerhouse combination that will knock any uncomfortable indigestion out solid (although it might knock you out, too). As an added bonus, this strain tastes like a nice minty after-dinner treat!\n \n   SFV OG Kush\nSFV OG Kush is a heavy indica to top all heavy indicas. Of Afghani origins, crossed with OG Kush and SFV OG, this indica has a spicy citrus kick followed by a sleepy stone. Don’t hit this bad boy unless you’re ready to go down for the count.\n \n   Bay Dream\nLooking for something that’ll settle your tummy but won’t leave you in a coma? Check out this savory sativa. A cross of Blue Dream and Bay 11, Bay Dream has a soothing effect on the stomach, with a cerebral burst of euphoria. This is also an excellent strain if you’re looking for a creative boost to get some work done.\n \n   Ringo’s Gift\nRingo\u0027s Gift is best for those looking for a dose of pain relief with their relaxation. This peppery strain crosses Harle-Tsu and ACDC for a powerful full-body pain reliever without the stoney couchlock effect. The body buzz is strong, but the cerebral effects are subtle – you might be talking someone’s ear off for 20 minutes before you notice.\n \n   Chemo\nThis strain’s name really says it all. It was conceived to counteract the side effects of chemotherapy, and this is easily the top strain for anyone dealing with nausea, stomach cramping, or a loss of appetite. Keep in mind that Chemo is P-O-T-E-N-T, but it\u0027s the perfect choice if you’re looking for a comfy after-dinner snooze.\n \n   Blue Hawaiian\nFor a more subtle approach, this combination of the classic Blue Dream and Hawaiian Sativa will smooth out your stomach and give you a happy head high. It\u0027s a balanced hybrid, offering a tropical taste of pineapple and a sweet burst of blueberry. After a few puffs, you’ll be feeling super mellow without a care in the world.\n \n   Strawberry\nStrawberry flavors highlight another stomach-soothing sativa strain you can try. It\u0027s especially good for those who might be prone to anxiety, as Strawberry offers a calm, relaxing buzz without the paranoia that is often common in sativa strains. This one is also a great choice for those who have social anxiety, particularly if your relatives are *ahem* out-staying their welcome.\n \n   Pure Kush\nTried and true, this indica is a favorite for those looking to stop their pain dead in its tracks. This is the strain you’ll want if you’re looking to sedate yourself into a sleepy stupor. It starts with a little sativa surge for the first few minutes, followed immediately by a pleasant pressure in your head and face. Once you settle yourself after a little dose of Pure Kush, don’t make any plans because you won’t be moving from your spot for a while.\n \n   Maui Bubble Gift\nWith a name like that, this strain sounds a bit discombobulated, but that’s really just because it’s a delightful hybrid composed of the best of all worlds. With origins in Maui Waui, Bubble Gum, and God’s Gift, this strain really is a gift. It\u0027s This usually high in CBD, with a pleasantly cerebral buzz from Maui Waui, a blast of pain relief from Bubble Gum, and a gentle, caressing body stone that swoops in at the last minute. Your tummy troubles will soon be forgotten with Maui Bubble Gift!\n \n   Hashberry\nThis is a nice indica to try as an indigestion aid that won’t knock you out. Hashberry has resinous buds covered in sticky trichomes, so keep in mind that it’s not a strain for beginners. It has a soothing effect on muscles as well as offers full body relaxation while still allowing some degree of sociability. You’ll be giggly and relaxed without being comatose.\nThere you have it! By now, hopefully you\u0027ve got your feet up, a smile on your face, and are experiencing blissful satisfaction (hopefully while wearing comfy, stretchy pants). Happy Turkey Day!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12001229/10-strains-to-aid-digestion-after-a-big-meal.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/10-strains-to-aid-digestion-after-a-big-meal"}],"reviewCount":166,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":50.233446519524612},{"name":"Blueberry","score":36.389360498019236},{"name":"Tropical","score":31.932654216185625},{"name":"Berry","score":30.185342388228637},{"name":"Flowery","score":26.20967741935484}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":118.54131295981891},{"name":"Uplifted","score":86.127617430673453},{"name":"Euphoric","score":81.211092246745892},{"name":"Relaxed","score":74.434069043576685},{"name":"Focused","score":51.1601584606678}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":67.649971703452181},{"name":"Depression","score":66.037068477645732},{"name":"Pain","score":37.733446519524612},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":33.623372948500283},{"name":"Fatigue","score":20.048104131295982}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":66.70911148839842},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":57.010469722693834},{"name":"PTSD","score":32.413695529145443},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":26.612903225806452},{"name":"Migraines","score":19.376061120543294}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":46.795415959252971},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":17.954159592529713},{"name":"Dizzy","score":12.768817204301076},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.0752688172043012},{"name":"Headache","score":0.94086021505376349}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-hawaiian_100x100_206d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000173/b/blue-hawaiian__primary_e9ad.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-hawaiian_100x100_602c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/667565/b/blue-hawaiian__primary_c445.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-hawaiian_100x100_4b1d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/657165/b/blue-hawaiian__primary_cd0d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-hawaiian_100x100_09ad.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619282/b/blue-hawaiian__primary_ad5d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-hawaiian_100x100_bd8c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522938/b/blue-hawaiian__primary_9dae.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-hawaiian_100x100_670a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522997/b/blue-hawaiian__primary_3329.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":36,"popularCities":["Eugene, OR","Portland, OR","Spokane Valley, WA","Spokane, WA","Vancouver, BC","Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Bellingham, WA","Everett, WA","Gold Bar, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-hawaiian","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.30120481927711/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Blueberry","subtitle":null,"slug":"blueberry","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/blueberry","symbol":"Bry","applink":"leafly://strain/blueberry"},{"name":"Hawaiian Sativa","subtitle":null,"slug":"hawaiian-sativa","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-sativa","symbol":"Has","applink":"leafly://strain/hawaiian-sativa"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":63,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

You think about counteracting your discomfort with some cannabis, but which strains will offer the best digestive aid?\nDon\u0027t worry, we\u0027re hear to help! Here are some strains to ease your aching tummy after a huge holiday meal.\n \n   Thin Mint GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\nThis hybrid cross has some pretty impressive origins – we all know the famous GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) of legendary status. Cross that with Durban Poison from a continent away in South Africa, and you’ve got a powerhouse combination that will knock any uncomfortable indigestion out solid (although it might knock you out, too). As an added bonus, this strain tastes like a nice minty after-dinner treat!\n \n   SFV OG Kush\nSFV OG Kush is a heavy indica to top all heavy indicas. Of Afghani origins, crossed with OG Kush and SFV OG, this indica has a spicy citrus kick followed by a sleepy stone. Don’t hit this bad boy unless you’re ready to go down for the count.\n \n   Bay Dream\nLooking for something that’ll settle your tummy but won’t leave you in a coma? Check out this savory sativa. A cross of Blue Dream and Bay 11, Bay Dream has a soothing effect on the stomach, with a cerebral burst of euphoria. This is also an excellent strain if you’re looking for a creative boost to get some work done.\n \n   Ringo’s Gift\nRingo\u0027s Gift is best for those looking for a dose of pain relief with their relaxation. This peppery strain crosses Harle-Tsu and ACDC for a powerful full-body pain reliever without the stoney couchlock effect. The body buzz is strong, but the cerebral effects are subtle – you might be talking someone’s ear off for 20 minutes before you notice.\n \n   Chemo\nThis strain’s name really says it all. It was conceived to counteract the side effects of chemotherapy, and this is easily the top strain for anyone dealing with nausea, stomach cramping, or a loss of appetite. Keep in mind that Chemo is P-O-T-E-N-T, but it\u0027s the perfect choice if you’re looking for a comfy after-dinner snooze.\n \n   Blue Hawaiian\nFor a more subtle approach, this combination of the classic Blue Dream and Hawaiian Sativa will smooth out your stomach and give you a happy head high. It\u0027s a balanced hybrid, offering a tropical taste of pineapple and a sweet burst of blueberry. After a few puffs, you’ll be feeling super mellow without a care in the world.\n \n   Strawberry\nStrawberry flavors highlight another stomach-soothing sativa strain you can try. It\u0027s especially good for those who might be prone to anxiety, as Strawberry offers a calm, relaxing buzz without the paranoia that is often common in sativa strains. This one is also a great choice for those who have social anxiety, particularly if your relatives are *ahem* out-staying their welcome.\n \n   Pure Kush\nTried and true, this indica is a favorite for those looking to stop their pain dead in its tracks. This is the strain you’ll want if you’re looking to sedate yourself into a sleepy stupor. It starts with a little sativa surge for the first few minutes, followed immediately by a pleasant pressure in your head and face. Once you settle yourself after a little dose of Pure Kush, don’t make any plans because you won’t be moving from your spot for a while.\n \n   Maui Bubble Gift\nWith a name like that, this strain sounds a bit discombobulated, but that’s really just because it’s a delightful hybrid composed of the best of all worlds. With origins in Maui Waui, Bubble Gum, and God’s Gift, this strain really is a gift. It\u0027s This usually high in CBD, with a pleasantly cerebral buzz from Maui Waui, a blast of pain relief from Bubble Gum, and a gentle, caressing body stone that swoops in at the last minute. Your tummy troubles will soon be forgotten with Maui Bubble Gift!\n \n   Hashberry\nThis is a nice indica to try as an indigestion aid that won’t knock you out. Hashberry has resinous buds covered in sticky trichomes, so keep in mind that it’s not a strain for beginners. It has a soothing effect on muscles as well as offers full body relaxation while still allowing some degree of sociability. You’ll be giggly and relaxed without being comatose.\nThere you have it! By now, hopefully you\u0027ve got your feet up, a smile on your face, and are experiencing blissful satisfaction (hopefully while wearing comfy, stretchy pants).
