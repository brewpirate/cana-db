To celebrate the arrival of an extra hour of sunlight, blossoming flowers, and warmer weather, here are 10 strains that come in like a lion but stick with you like a lamb.\nPeach Spice\n\nStrain combination: Cotton Candy Kush and Green Queen\n\nThe sweet pear flavor in Cotton Candy Kush is balanced wonderfully by the spicy, nutty character of Green Queen.\nCherry Creamsicle\n\nStrain combination: Vanilla Kush and Cherry Bomb\n\nThe heavier, smooth Vanilla Kush is beautifully complemented by the sweet cherry flavor of the lighter Cherry Bomb.\nStrawberry Mojito\n\nStrain combination: Strawberry Kush and Thin Mint\n\nThe unmistakable Thin Mint flavor and hybrid effects are perfectly balanced by the more physical Strawberry Kush.\nBerry Tartlet\n\nStrain combination: Blackberry Kush and Lemon Haze\n\nThese two strong flavors coupled with contrasting effects provide a balanced, memorable experience.\nBanana Brush\n\nStrain combination: Banana Kush and Durban Poison\n\nThe distinct sweetness of Banana Kush could only be matched with an earthy, uplifting flower like Durban Poison.\nBlue Bayou\n\nStrain combination: Blue Cheese and Blue Haze\n\nBlue cheese and peppered pear is the name of the game with these two acclaimed hybrids.\nWaldorf\n\nStrain combination: SAGE and Island Sweet Skunk\n\nThe spicy sandalwood and earthy flavors of SAGE combined with Island Sweet Skunk’s buttery apple taste creates a pairing reminiscent of a classic Waldorf salad.\nRubies ‘n Roses\n\nStrain combination: White Russian and Grapefruit\n\nIn a happy synthesis of citrus, floral, and earthy undertones, this pair provides a pleasant, invigorating lift.\nTropical Vacation\n\nStrain combination: Pineapple Express and Cannalope Haze\n\nLet this fruity coalescence of sweet pineapple, mango, and berry take you far, far away.\nChocolate Peel\n\nStrain combination: Orange Kush and Chocolope\n\nOrange and chocolate, with additional sweet and earthy undertones, make this pair a no-brainer.\nPhoto credits: header strawberry mint, pear blue cheese, grapefruit, blackberry lemon, cherry vanilla, banana pine, chocolate orange, peach and spices, mango pineapple, apple
