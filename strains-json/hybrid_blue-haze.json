            "text": "After a brutal winter that ravaged most of the United States, many of you are probably thrilled that the first day of spring is finally upon us. To celebrate the arrival of an extra hour of sunlight, blossoming flowers, and warmer weather, here are 10 strains that come in like a lion but stick with you like a lamb.\nPeach Spice\n\nStrain combination: Cotton Candy Kush and Green Queen\n\nThe sweet pear flavor in Cotton Candy Kush is balanced wonderfully by the spicy, nutty character of Green Queen.\nCherry Creamsicle\n\nStrain combination: Vanilla Kush and Cherry Bomb\n\nThe heavier, smooth Vanilla Kush is beautifully complemented by the sweet cherry flavor of the lighter Cherry Bomb.\nStrawberry Mojito\n\nStrain combination: Strawberry Kush and Thin Mint\n\nThe unmistakable Thin Mint flavor and hybrid effects are perfectly balanced by the more physical Strawberry Kush.\nBerry Tartlet\n\nStrain\u00a0combination: Blackberry Kush and Lemon Haze\n\nThese two strong flavors coupled with contrasting effects provide a balanced, memorable experience.\nBanana Brush\n\nStrain combination: Banana Kush and Durban Poison\n\nThe distinct sweetness of Banana Kush could only be matched with an earthy, uplifting flower like Durban Poison.\nBlue Bayou\n\nStrain combination: Blue Cheese and Blue Haze\n\nBlue cheese and peppered pear is the name of the game with these two acclaimed hybrids.\nWaldorf\n\nStrain combination: SAGE\u00a0and Island Sweet Skunk\n\nThe spicy sandalwood and earthy flavors of SAGE combined with Island Sweet Skunk\u2019s buttery apple taste creates a pairing reminiscent of a classic Waldorf salad.\nRubies \u2018n Roses\n\nStrain combination: White Russian and Grapefruit\n\nIn a happy synthesis of citrus, floral, and earthy undertones, this pair provides a pleasant, invigorating lift.\nTropical Vacation\n\nStrain combination: Pineapple Express and Cannalope Haze\n\nLet this fruity coalescence of sweet pineapple, mango, and berry take you far, far away.\nChocolate Peel\n\nStrain combination: Orange Kush and Chocolope\n\nOrange and chocolate, with additional sweet and earthy\u00a0undertones, make this pair a no-brainer.\nPhoto credits: header\u00a0strawberry mint, pear blue cheese, grapefruit, blackberry lemon, cherry vanilla, banana pine, chocolate orange, peach and spices, mango pineapple, apple sage\u00a0",
