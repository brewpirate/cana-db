Feels like I walked into a wall face-first...I can feel the physical impact on my cheeks and forehead. Haha. Weird. Head is extremely floaty and fuzzed out. Stupefying stoniness, my hole body slumps in relaxation. There’s a permanent island of clarity in there somewhere that maintains 30% functionality. Can kind of focus and concentrate, but the ability drops off quickly and you have to restart. That short attention span makes watching stuff wonderfully compelling. Looks and “feels” good, like prescription medicine a la vicodin. The medically suppressed, yet rosy emotional state keeps things light and fun but doesn’t offer a wide range of empathy - so stick to comedy, feel-good, documentaries -nothing that requires you take it seriously. Socializing comes easy and is enjoyably similar to being drunk. There is a strange wariness that stays present and contributes to a score of 6.5 out of 10.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/kZ3iwRmPT5O6arIA05kqrPWjazc=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net%2fdZCCCxYREQnXfPfK6mXSTpqotAY%3d%2f120x120%2fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3.amazonaws.com%252Fleafly%252Fbin%252FGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1468515,"username":"kayspace","text":"Strain is good, good high, munchies are intense.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":33,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":25.373134328358208},{"name":"Pepper","score":25},{"name":"Blueberry","score":1.4925373134328357},{"name":"Sweet","score":0.74626865671641784},{"name":"Flowery","score":0.74626865671641784}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":54.477611940298509},{"name":"Focused","score":52.238805970149251},{"name":"Hungry","score":51.865671641791046},{"name":"Happy","score":31.343283582089551},{"name":"Talkative","score":28.35820895522388}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":29.850746268656717},{"name":"Headaches","score":26.119402985074625},{"name":"Spasticity","score":25},{"name":"Stress","score":5.5970149253731343},{"name":"Insomnia","score":2.9850746268656714}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":5.9701492537313428},{"name":"Migraines","score":3.3582089552238807},{"name":"PMS","score":0.74626865671641784},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":0.74626865671641784},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":0.37313432835820892}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":53.35820895522388},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":29.104477611940297},{"name":"Dizzy","score":26.119402985074625},{"name":"Paranoid","score":26.119402985074625},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.37313432835820892}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-ivy_100x100_9b3f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/283758/b/blue-ivy__primary_5f62.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-ivy_100x100_e895.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/63699/b/blue-ivy_825x550_afe3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-ivy_100x100_fd76.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/42957/b/blue-ivy_825x550_5c07.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-ivy_100x100_3bab.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/37964/b/blue-ivy_825x550_038f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-ivy_100x100_d8ef.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/28308/b/blue-ivy_825x550_443a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/Blue-Ivy_100x100_y1kahlqp.2iz.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/5713/b/blue-ivy_825x550_ydrjc33q.txd.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":9,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-ivy","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.39393939393939/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
