            "text": "I like this strain though I've only tried it from Absolute Xtracts vape cartridge. The flavor is fresh and piney. Maybe a little grassy or hoppy too? I think it's smells a little like a fresh hop beer (which I like). I didn't notice any blueberry or sweetness, so I wonder if the genetics are correct in this entry for what I purchased in concentrate? Actually if I think about blueberry when hitting the vape, I think I can taste it in there and just didn't notice before I knew to look for it. \n\nLabel on the cartridge revealed the strain to be 5:2 ratio of CBD:THC (CBD 50.1%, THC 21%), which is a desirable anxioloytic ratio that still provides the sensory enhancing psychological effects associated with THC, but not at an overwhelming level. It's quite mellow, and uplifting. Helps me focus on a task at hand rather than being easily distracted as per my usual. The effects are decidedly indica-dominant (which I also prefer). Sativas make me paranoid; even the high-CBD ones make my heart pound and wake me up too much to be able to sleep at night. In other words they don't help me get to bed on time. This isn't like that at all. It's mellow enough that I can easily drift to sleep on it if I want to, but I won't be so sedated that I have to. \n\nI didn't realize I was an anxious person until I started vaping this strain regularly and see what life is like without low-level anxiety or fear about everything. I feel so much more secure and happy. And that's not just when I'm smoking/vaping high CBD strains. The effects seem to last as I learn new ways of dealing with the world. ",
