            "text": "\ud83c\udf53\ud83c\udf32 Blue Kush is a prime example of everything a good sativa-dominant hybrid should be. The smell and taste is fantastic, with strong flavors of pine, lemon and sweet berry immediately flooding the senses. I had high expectations set for this strain, as it came highly recommended to me by more than one person. They were exceeded. The initial feeling is an uplifting relief, quite relaxing, while the euphoria slowly creeps in. This strain has just the right balance of effects, with all the best parts of a super sativa and just enough of the relaxation brought out by the indica. It will motivate you and fuel your creativity. This is exactly what I look for and this strain hits the nail on the head! I cannot recommend Blue Kush enough. If strains were women, Blue Kush would have the best tush!",
