As a student who is constantly stressed with all sorts of workloads, this is the perfect strain to dial-in on your work or get fired up for a wild night out. It helps a lot with stress and anxiety by providing such a great euphoric feeling. This is by far the best dope I have ever smoked, every time it is available it is a treat and a must-buy.",
