(I actually suggested it to leafly!) It gave the most stereotypical high I\u0027ve had. Very giggly, very relaxed, very happy, and lasted forever. The only reason it\u0027s not one of my favorites is because, focusing is virtually impossible, and if you want a high for a shorter amount of time, even if you smoke a small amount, its not happening...at all lol.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"},{"id":1570504,"username":"PaleoStoneMan","text":"Have you noticed that virtually every reviewer believes this strain is special?  It\u0027s because it is. This is one of those unique strains that has an amazing smell from a unique sweet blueberry muffin terpene profile, a powerful euphoric effect, beautiful crystal structure and a calm and focused high.  I don\u0027t feel the munchies or apprehension or anxiety or fear at all - super smooth inner calm reminds me of Gorilla Glue #4. Better than Blue Dream by a mile.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/YEN1LqXiYCOvWiFhmP-4p67iqDM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fY9fB9qHySLml8016ysgJ_goggles-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3233","title":"New Strains Alert: Blue Nightmare, Middlefork x Pineapple Express, U2 Kush, Snoop Dogg OG, and Ripped Bubba","author":"Kayla Williams","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1408118400000)\/","text":"Balance is the name of the game this week with a harmonious but diverse assortment flowers: Ripped Bubba, Snoop Dogg OG, Middlefork x Pineapple Express, U2 Kush, and Blue Nightmare.
