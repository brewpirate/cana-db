The only reason it's not one of my favorites is because, focusing is virtually impossible, and if you want a high for a shorter amount of time, even if you smoke a small amount, its not happening...at all lol.",

This is one of those unique strains that has an amazing smell from a unique sweet blueberry muffin terpene profile, a powerful euphoric effect, beautiful crystal structure and a calm and focused high.  I don't feel the munchies or apprehension or anxiety or fear at all - super smooth inner calm reminds me of Gorilla Glue #4. Better than Blue Dream by a mile.",
