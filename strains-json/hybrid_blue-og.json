The pain relief from Blue OG, alone, is enough to knock out a migraine and even depress/eliminate pain from diabetic neuropathy. The only negative side effect from this strain is possibly a dry mouth or dry eyes. I consider this a sublime, hybrid strain in every shape and form because of its potent medical benefits against rigors of the mind and pain in the body and lack of major side effects.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"},{"id":1637528,"username":"sheisblue242","text":"Head high, not sleepy, not talkative ","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":138,"flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","score":49.946524064171122},{"name":"Earthy","score":28.520499108734402},{"name":"Sweet","score":27.914438502673796},{"name":"Pungent","score":21.880570409982173},{"name":"Pine","score":20.51693404634581}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":84.509803921568619},{"name":"Happy","score":75.686274509803923},{"name":"Euphoric","score":72.201426024955438},{"name":"Uplifted","score":61.345811051693396},{"name":"Energetic","score":48.27985739750445}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Nausea","score":42.245989304812831},{"name":"Stress","score":35.401069518716575},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":33.787878787878782},{"name":"Pain","score":31.55080213903743},{"name":"Insomnia","score":28.823529411764703}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":18.333333333333332},{"name":"Anxiety","score":14.429590017825312},{"name":"Migraines","score":10.793226381461675},{"name":"Arthritis","score":10.18716577540107},{"name":"PTSD","score":7.85204991087344}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":15.035650623885918},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.0303030303030303},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.5151515151515151},{"name":"Headache","score":1.2121212121212122},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.90909090909090906}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-og_100x100_eb51.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001001/b/blue-og__primary_736c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-og_100x100_ab95.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/671381/b/blue-og__primary_370d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-og_100x100_ffb3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/640138/b/blue-og__primary_0525.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-og_100x100_0797.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/640108/b/blue-og__primary_4097.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-og_100x100_43cc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/609520/b/blue-og__primary_e150.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-og_100x100_aa30.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/595635/b/blue-og__primary_c890.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":60,"popularCities":["Denver, CO","Portland, OR","Eugene, OR","San Diego, CA","Spokane, WA","Beaverton, OR","Calgary, AB","Everett, WA","Newberg, OR","Phoenix, AZ"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.28260869565217/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Blueberry","subtitle":null,"slug":"blueberry","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/blueberry","symbol":"Bry","applink":"leafly://strain/blueberry"},{"name":"Blue Moonshine","subtitle":null,"slug":"blue-moonshine","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/blue-moonshine","symbol":"Blm","applink":"leafly://strain/blue-moonshine"},{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
