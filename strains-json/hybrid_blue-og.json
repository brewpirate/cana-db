            "text": "Blue OG gives early hints of a sickeningly-sweet scent of diluted jet fuel that turns into robust growth with progressive skunk undertones the further into flowering you go. After 8 weeks of flowering, Blue OG can be cut and put into curing. If you can go 9-10 weeks of flowering, the plant will continue to grow and amaze you with its late growth. Blue OG has a deep sea-green color to its buds once broken apart, which reveals its deep blue genetics from its Blueberry (F3) and Blue Moonshine cross. Blue OG is great medicine for anyone suffering from bi-polar disorder, anxiety, CNS pain, and depression. The pain relief from Blue OG, alone, is enough to knock out a migraine and even depress/eliminate pain from diabetic neuropathy. The only negative side effect from this strain is possibly a dry mouth or dry eyes. I consider this a sublime, hybrid strain in every shape and form because of its potent medical benefits against rigors of the mind and pain in the body and lack of major side effects.",
