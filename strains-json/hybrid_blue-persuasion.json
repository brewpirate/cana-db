Frosty nugs snow'd keif in the grinder and was really happy with the look and smell overall. \n\nMine seemed heavy on the indica side but really put a smile on my face nonetheless as the anxiety melted away and comfort washed over my body. Quite potent certainly not panic inducing, had the urge to talk a lot. Focused high as well, clear and not spacey.",
