If I want to get baked I choose something specifically for that (ah, the variety of growing your own in addition to sampling what the collectives have...what a life!). BR allows me to be completely focused, lightly buzzed, incredibly creative and energetic. I usually partake if I'm stuck. I am unstuck within an hour, completing the project better than I had originally envisioned. The 'project' doesn't have to be enormous either. Sometimes a project is just getting out of bed, if you take my meaning, for those of us who have bi-polar issues this is a familiar thought pattern.\r\n",

Initially ur greeted with a gentle rush of euphoric energy, that helps u either focus on a task or just allow u to have a good time with friends. The Indica kicks in afterwards, where u feel so relaxed, cozy and ready to be in bed and let it lull you to sleep. \n\nEnjoy",
