Killer Grape\n\nA cross between Killer Queen and Querkle, Killer Grape is a heavy-handed 50/50 hybrid strain that deals a stupefying blast of cerebral euphoria and deeply relaxing effects. Lavender and purple hues tinge leaves and buds underneath a dusty coat of snow-white resin. This strain from NorStar Genetics gets its name from the sour grape aroma its buds carry, which is accented by spicy, hashy undertones.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Killer Grape\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Mt. Cook\n\nNamed after the highest peak in New Zealand, Mt. Cook by Kiwiseeds is a former Cannabis Cup champion. After selecting their top Afghani female, a special Northern Lights and Hash Plant male was used to pollinate and create this potent indica. Known to be powerful and sedative, this is a great strain to relax and catch some sleep with.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Island Maui Haze\n\nIsland Maui Haze is a 75/25 sativa-dominant strain with effects that can creep up on you. These dense, forest green buds may not initially attract you based on its strong, ammonia smell; however, this crystal-covered strain is praised for its uplifting, energetic effects that can relieve pain and other symptoms without bringing you down into a lazy state.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Island Maui Haze\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Leda Uno\n\nA Cannabis Cup finalist in the sativa category, Leda Uno will undoubtedly raise your spirits. The team at KC Brains took its KC 33 crossed with a Brazilian female landrace and crossed it once more with its KC 606 and Leda hybrid. The result is a smooth lemony hybrid with beautiful chunky, light green buds. Best when grown in soil, this plant can shoot to 10 feet outdoors and produces considerable yields.\n\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",

            "text": "If you like light, mild hybrids, Blue Thai is the strain for you. Well-balanced and pretty middle of the road, this strain doesn't favor one effect over another.  The mental component was clear-headed and present; awake and engaged.  Physically, Blue Thai provided a light buzz without being heavy or couch-locked.  Great for the middle-of-the-day smoke session, this strain is a solid choice for gaining some momentum on of those around-the-house projects that has been sitting on your weekend to-do list since last Spring.  Those looking to use cannabis medicinally may find that Blue Thai helps relieve fatigue and some symptoms of anxiety disorders",
