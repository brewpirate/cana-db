It provides a very smooth vape.  It hits you right upfront, making you feel like you have drunk 2 or 3 glasses of wine.  That effect transitions into a warmth that surges up from your core and out through your throat.  This body high is a warm and cozy feeling.  This strain provides for a beautiful relaxation effect making areas of muscle tension fade away. You will definitely experience dry mouth and crave ice cold water/drinks.  After about 15 minutes there is a nice cerebral floating effect that goes with this strain followed by a body high that lodges inside your libido making you crave sex.  The arousal comes on strong!  Grab your lover and get on it!  Overall this strain is great for chilling by a fire or having sex, or even better both of those at the same time.   Medically this strain has helped with migraines and the nausea that comes with that.  It is also great at curbing anxiety. I would also say that this strain provides elevated mood levels, almost like an endorphin rush that makes your overall mood feel happy.
