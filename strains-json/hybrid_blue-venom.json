            "text": "The strain Blue Venom may be foreign to you, but I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ve heard of both Blueberry and White Widow, two breeding staples that happened to parent this indica-dominant hybrid. A quick whiff of the open jar and a glance at this strain\u2019s trichome coverage is all you need to piece together Blue Venom\u2019s lineage: Blueberry\u2019s sweet berry aroma is easily distinguished while White Widow reveals itself through a frosty coat of resin, oozing from every crack and crevice.\nBlue Venom\u2019s bliss begins before you even indulge as enticing blueberry notes burst from the tight, sticky buds. When smoked, its potency is immediately detected in the head with a rush of calming euphoria that trickles out to the rest of the body. In a vaporizer, this strain\u00a0tends to have a slower onset, but the creeping flood of full-body relaxation seems to hit even harder than its smoked form.\u00a0\nWhile a potent indica-dominant strain may not be your typical morning go-to, Blue Venom is remarkably conducive to engaged concentration on any one task. For consumers with a lower THC tolerance, this sense of focus may be more difficult to harness, but Blue Venom has many other merits, especially for patients treating severe pain, nausea, depression, and stress disorders. Blue Venom has a way of injecting social gatherings with fits of laughter and tomfoolery, and when your body is ready to shut down for the night, this hybrid is there to help tranquilize you.\nBlue Venom was first bred by G13 Labs, but this batch comes from the gardens of NW Flowers (via Have a Heart Cafe) in Washington state. This hybrid may express its aroma and effects differently across growers and phenotypes, so to give you an idea of what characteristics Blue Venom may potentially exhibit, here\u2019s some background on its parentage.\n\u00a0 \u00a0White Widow\n\n\u201cA cross between a Brazilian sativa landrace and a resin-heavy South Indian indica, \u00a0White Widow has blessed every Dutch coffee shop menu since its birth in the 1990s. Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity.\u201d\n\nTerpenes\u00a0Commonly Found in White Widow\n\u00a0\nMyrcene\u00a0\nAroma: Musky, cloves, earthy, herbal with notes of citrus and tropical fruit\nEffects: Sedating \u201ccouchlock\u201d effect, relaxing\nMedical Value: Antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic; good for muscle tension, sleeplessness, pain, inflammation, depression\nLimonene\nAroma: Citrus\nEffects: Elevated mood, stress relief\nMedical Value: Antifungal, anti-bacterial, anti-carcinogenic, dissolves gallstones, mood-enhancer; may treat gastrointestinal complications, heartburn, depression\nCaryophyllene\nAroma: Pepper, spicy, woody, cloves\nEffects: No detectable physical effects\nMedical Value: Gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory; good for arthritis, ulcers, autoimmune disorders, and other gastrointestinal complications\n\u00a0 \u00a0Blueberry\n\nBlueberry is an 80% indica strain that provides a pleasant and long-lasting high. This strain has a sweet fruity smell and tastes like blueberries.\n\nTerpenes\u00a0Commonly Found in Blueberry\n\u00a0\nLinalool\nAroma: Floral, citrus, candy\nEffects: Anxiety relief and sedation\nMedical Value: Anti-anxiety, anti-convulsant, anti-depressant, anti-acne\nPinene\nAroma: Pine\nEffects: Alertness, memory retention, counteracts some THC effects\nMedical Value: Asthma, antiseptic",
