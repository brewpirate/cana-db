In a vaporizer, this strain tends to have a slower onset, but the creeping flood of full-body relaxation seems to hit even harder than its smoked form. \nWhile a potent indica-dominant strain may not be your typical morning go-to, Blue Venom is remarkably conducive to engaged concentration on any one task. For consumers with a lower THC tolerance, this sense of focus may be more difficult to harness, but Blue Venom has many other merits, especially for patients treating severe pain, nausea, depression, and stress disorders. Blue Venom has a way of injecting social gatherings with fits of laughter and tomfoolery, and when your body is ready to shut down for the night, this hybrid is there to help tranquilize you.\nBlue Venom was first bred by G13 Labs, but this batch comes from the gardens of NW Flowers (via Have a Heart Cafe) in Washington state. This hybrid may express its aroma and effects differently across growers and phenotypes, so to give you an idea of what characteristics Blue Venom may potentially exhibit, here’s some background on its parentage.\n   White Widow\n\n“A cross between a Brazilian sativa landrace and a resin-heavy South Indian indica,  White Widow has blessed every Dutch coffee shop menu since its birth in the 1990s. Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity.”\n\nTerpenes Commonly Found in White Widow\n \nMyrcene \nAroma: Musky, cloves, earthy, herbal with notes of citrus and tropical fruit\nEffects: Sedating “couchlock” effect, relaxing\nMedical Value: Antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic; good for muscle tension, sleeplessness, pain, inflammation, depression\nLimonene\nAroma: Citrus\nEffects: Elevated mood, stress relief\nMedical Value: Antifungal, anti-bacterial, anti-carcinogenic, dissolves gallstones, mood-enhancer; may treat gastrointestinal complications, heartburn, depression\nCaryophyllene\nAroma: Pepper, spicy, woody, cloves\nEffects: No detectable physical effects\nMedical Value: Gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory; good for arthritis, ulcers, autoimmune disorders, and other gastrointestinal complications\n   Blueberry\n\nBlueberry is an 80% indica strain that provides a pleasant and long-lasting high.
