But when mixed with this particular sativa  strain the effects are amazing. After medicating with this I think I found a new favorite. It was able to greatly relieve my anxiety and depression without giving me lethargic feeling that comes from some high THC Indicas. The joy was there and I was still able to stay productive.",
