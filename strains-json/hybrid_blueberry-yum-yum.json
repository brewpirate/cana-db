            "text": "We're rolling into 2015 with five new strains nominated by you using the Leafly app! If you had a jarring, eventful transition into the new year, these\u00a0hybrids are just what you'll need to recover balanced equilibrium. Or, for those who had a relaxing night in, one of these new varieties should be all you need to stay on track for a blissful, stress-free 2015 launch.\nWe know many of you are no stranger to these new strains, so be sure to leave a review sharing your thoughts if you've had a chance to try one already!\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a01. White Nightmare\nCharacteristics of White Nightmare:\n\nBlue Dream\u2019s soaring\u00a0sativa\u00a0effects and\u00a0fruity\u00a0flavors collide with White Moonshine\u2019s resinous coat of milky\u00a0trichomes\u00a0to produce White Nightmare. The sativa-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0brings a forceful,\u00a0sweet\u00a0aroma of\u00a0berries\u00a0and\u00a0Haze. The flavor stays true to its Blue Dream genetics but with an\u00a0earthy, hash-like aftertaste. White Nightmare generates a stimulating stream of\u00a0euphoria\u00a0and bliss that\u00a0elevates the mood\u00a0and brings with it a comfortable,\u00a0relaxing\u00a0body high.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a02. Monkey Paw\nCharacteristics of Monkey Paw:\n\nMonkey Paw takes its name from its fingerling buds that resemble the curled paws of primates. It is a fabled old school strain whose roots sprouted in Michigan and has built a solid reputation for itself across the Midwest. This\u00a0hybrid\u00a0is a compelling mixture of\u00a0Acapulco Gold\u00a0and\u00a0Colombian Gold\u00a0sativas\u00a0that are balanced by\u00a0Afghani\u2019s\u00a0indica\u00a0influence to produce a\u00a0pungent\u00a0combination of\u00a0sweet\u00a0and\u00a0fruity\u00a0flavors. Its aroma is reminiscent of the thick musk of\u00a0Skunk\u00a0varieties with sharp notes of zesty\u00a0citrus\u00a0that cut the senses. The aftertaste of fresh fruits, like\u00a0grape\u00a0and\u00a0blueberry, serves as precursor to the\u00a0relaxing\u00a0effects that calm body\u00a0pains\u00a0and\u00a0stimulate the stomach.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a03. Lost Coast OG\nCharacteristics of Lost Coast OG:\n\nLost Coast OG is a 60/40 indica-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that marries\u00a0Chemdawg 4\u00a0genetics with those of two age-old\u00a0heirloom strains, Pakistani Kush and\u00a0Lemon Thai. Flavors of sour\u00a0citrus\u00a0and\u00a0earthy\u00a0musk burst through on the exhale in show of its signature OG\u00a0terpene\u00a0profile. This California native induces a soaring cerebral buzzing sensation that brings new vitality to\u00a0mood,\u00a0creativity, and\u00a0conversation. The potently euphoric effects can sometimes skid into anxiety with large doses, so novices should approach this OG with some degree of caution.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a04. Crazy Miss Hyde\nCharacteristics of Crazy Miss Hyde:\n\nCrazy Miss Hyde is a surprisingly balanced\u00a0hybrid\u00a0given her name. She is a lively combination of the\u00a0uplifting,\u00a0sativa-dominant\u00a0Belladona\u00a0and the powerhouse\u00a0indica\u00a0Northern Lights. The buds deliver a potent mixture of\u00a0earthy\u00a0flavors like\u00a0menthol\u00a0and chocolate with a\u00a0sweet\u00a0vanilla\u00a0influence. The effects tend to be focused in the head, with thought provoking stimulation and\u00a0creativity\u00a0that can border on\u00a0anxiety\u00a0when over-consumed. With the right dosing, the indica influence levels out the effects of Crazy Miss Hyde and induces a\u00a0relaxing\u00a0sense of\u00a0euphoria.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a05. Blueberry Yum Yum\nCharacteristics of Blueberry Yum Yum:\n\nBlueberry Yum Yum is a\u00a0hybrid\u00a0strain whose popularity was ushered in by rap artist Ludacris and his song centered on the strain. While certainly the progeny of the famed\u00a0Blueberry\u00a0indica, its other parent is suspected to have been a\u00a0Durban Poison\u00a0sativa. Because of its parents\u2019 polarity, Blueberry Yum Yum can express a wide spectrum of effects, but consumers typically report\u00a0uplifting,\u00a0happy\u00a0effects perfect for any time of the day. Though dominated by an unmistakable\u00a0blueberry\u00a0aroma, accents of\u00a0earthy\u00a0mint\u00a0and\u00a0pine\u00a0can also be detected on the palate.\u00a0",
