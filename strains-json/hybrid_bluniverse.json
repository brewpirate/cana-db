            "text": "The blues is a timeless genre full of heart and soul. Starting in the 19th\u00a0century, blues formed in black communities of the deep south and has strong roots in African musical traditions. Early blues songs were accompanied by lyrics recounting experiences of racial discrimination and other similar hardships faced by black Americans. The genre has persisted through the years, often being combined with elements of jazz, soul, rock, spirituals, and R&B.\n\nWhatever form it takes, the blues is a genre that grabs you by the heart and demands an emotional response. Below, enjoy five impactful blues albums with our recommended strains and tune in to your emotional center.\nSouthern Avenue by Southern Avenue\n(Spotify)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Bluniverse\nSouthern Avenue released its lively self-titled album in 2017 and burst onto the blues scene with a refreshing style.
