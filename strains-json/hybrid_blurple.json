            "text": "For every color in the rainbow there is a complementing strain ready to match each individual\u2019s absolute favorite hue. Only drink out of blue cups? Wear a lot of purple?\u00a0 Refuse to eat something that isn\u2019t orange-tinted? Pair your number one color with a little bit of green! Below we list a strain pairing that goes hand in hand with each letter in ROYGBIV.\nRed\n\nFiery, passionate, sensual \u2013 red is a power color that tends to\u00a0allure the sexes and could\u00a0possibly give you a promotion. Pair this magnetic color with the \u201cspeedy and intense\u201d Panama Red, a full sativa that will match that flash of red lipstick or vibrant watch band.\nOrange\n\nThis warm and fizzy hue can only pair best with a warm and fizzy strain. Enter Orange Crush \u2013 its sweet and tangy flavor perfectly complements its twin color.\nYellow\n\nIn the dead of winter, yellow reminisces sunny days and lemonade. Try Lemon Haze to melt the frost \u2013 it\u2019s a citrusy sativa whose buds appear green and yellow. The\u00a0lemony taste will bring back your sunny disposition through these chilly months.\nGreen\n\nWith 2017\u2019s color of the year being \u201cgreenery,\u201d the hybrid Green Dream is an excellent addition to any green stash.\nBlue\n\nBlue has always been a fan favorite and possibly the most popular color of the rainbow \u2013 it\u2019s calming, tranquil, and makes one think of the sky and the sea. The hybrid ArcticBlue\u00a0pairs well with this peaceful color and\u00a0its anti-anxiety effects.\nHonorable mention goes to the hybrid\u00a0Blue Dream, a strain that has become just as popular as the color itself.\nIndigo\n\nIndigo is the in-between of purple and blue \u2013 a deep, gorgeous hue that can only be complemented by the hybrid strain Blurple. It\u2019s the best mix of Blue Dream and Mendocino Purps, just as indigo is the best mix of purple and blue, aka \u201cblurple.\u201d\nViolet\n\nA color that\u00a0received its name from the violet flower, it\u2019s only logical to pair this beautiful hue with the hybrid strain Violet Delight. It releases a strong floral flavor that will\u00a0have you dreaming in shades of purple.\nIf your favorite color is outside of the rainbow spectrum, we have a couple of honorary mentions for you to pick up.\n\nPink\n\nThough pink is not technically a color of the rainbow, we couldn\u2019t leave out this bubblegum pop favorite. Pair that Pepto-Bismol toned jacket that\u2019s been collecting dust in your closet with the sweet and fruity indica Pink Berry.\nBlack\n\nFor those who live and breathe in\u00a0waves of black, don\u2019t pass up the indica Black Domina. It\u2019s a strain designed for late night,\u00a0so\u00a0grab your best black pajamas, black slippers, black robe, and pull in this heavy strain deep into the night.",

            "text": "These strains have just been added to the Leafly Explorer! For the ones you've tried, you should leave a review reminiscing over all the good times with that strain. If you haven't had the chance to test any of these varieties out, don't fret \u2014 the links below will tell you whether or not that strain is being offered at a shop near you.\n\u00a0\n 1. Strawberry Fields \n\nStrawberry Fields by Sagarmatha Seeds is an indica-dominant hybrid strain that takes the flavorful Strawberry Cough and crosses it with an undisclosed indica parent. This strain is destined for consumers who love that strawberry aroma, but would prefer something more tranquilizing than the Strawberry Cough sativa. Its heavier effects also make Strawberry Fields a better choice for patients treating pain, insomnia, and appetite loss.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Strawberry Fields\n\u00a0\n 2. Blurple\n\nBlurple, also known as Blue Dream Purple, is a balanced hybrid cross between Blue Dream and Mendocino Purps. Its effects position themselves cerebrally at first, with gentle body relaxation that keeps you feeling light and free of tension. Drawing from both sides of the family, Blurple carries a sweet, dessert-like berry and grape aroma that comes to life on the inhale. This strain earns its name as bluish purple hues swirl throughout Blurple\u2019s green buds.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Blurple\n\u00a0\n 3. Kona Gold\n\nKona Gold is a sativa strain that has traveled far from its native origin, the volcanic soils of Hawaii\u2019s Big Island. Soaring cerebral-focused euphoria captures the mind while leaving the body light and functional, making this sativa a perfect pair with or replacement for your morning cup of coffee. A tropical medley of pineapple and citrus flavors are cut by a sharp sour aroma that could almost be compared to diesel fuel. The authentic Kona Gold is unique to its mineral-rich homeland, but its replications overseas still have much to offer sativa enthusiasts.\n\nKona Gold is currently available at QPC in Everett, WA\n\u00a0\n 4. Skunk 47\n\nSkunk 47, offspring of Skunk #1 and AK-47, is a sour-smelling hybrid strain that leans far to the indica side of the family. Bred by World of Seeds Bank, Skunk 47\u2019s parents were selected for pungent aromas and fast flowering cycles. Additionally, Skunk 47 plants have a high resistance to mold and pests. Its indica tendencies come out strong in this strain\u2019s effects, delivering a crushing heaviness perfect for stubborn pain or sleepless nights.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Skunk 47\n\u00a0\n 5. Blackberry Trainwreck\n\nBlackberry Trainwreck, or Blackberry Wreck, is a hybrid strain parented by two notable varieties, Blackberry Kush and Trainwreck. Led by indica genetics, Blackberry Trainwreck typically grows into chunky, dense conic buds that offer a sweet and earthy mix of berry flavors. Tension and stress melt away from the body on the exhale while the mind elevates to lighthearted positivity.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Blackberry Trainwreck\n\u00a0\n 6. Whitaker Blues\n\nWhitaker Blues is a classic indica-dominant strain that blends genetics from Quimby (a West Coast indica) and Blueberry. Breeder DJ Short is famous for his Blueberry line, but this strain was actually developed by his son, JD. A true indica in appearance and effect, Whitaker Blues grows into stout bushy plants and delivers a sedating stone that leaves you feeling heavy with dreamy bliss. Its flavors can span the entire spectrum of sweetness, so you may find yourself detecting anything from floral vanilla to fruity citrus. Whitaker Blues\u2019 effects are initially enlivening but taper down into a deep transcendental calm conducive for meditation or lazy days.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Whitaker Blues\n\u00a0\n 7. Double Barrel OG\n\nDouble Barrel OG offers a double shot of OG genetics as this hybrid combines White Fire OG with Raskal\u2019s OG Kush. Its dense, resin-packed buds give rise to flavors both sweet and sour, a pungent fusion of sweet lemons and fuel-drenched pine. This hybrid travels straight to the head, launching you into thick euphoric lucidity that lets you forget any heaviness in mind or body. As the acute effects settle, Double Barrel OG eases you into a motivated and functional buzz perfect for afternoon productivity.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Double Barrel OG\n\u00a0\nCheck out our other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or catch up on last week's New Strains Alert!",

            "text": "COLORFUL Flowers \nGreen yeah but with hues of Blue, Purple, Silver \n\nBud density seems Indica sided.\n(and will later turn out to be surprisingly even more dense than it feels initially to the touch)\n\nAroma is predominantly Ground Black Pepper (here we go again) but with some very interesting FLORAL or FRUITY undertones BUT\nwhen ground lightly between the fingers, releases an Aroma unlike any other strain that I'm familiar with. It's Sharp, GRAPE, Floral, Fruity, and no more black pepper, but guess what LICORICE, Black Licorice. What the heck \n\nOnce properly ground in a Grinder, tons of dark looking dust still remained in the top grinding part (no complaints), and the basket part was extra full of fun, more than normal for my standard amount ground (0.5g) \nLooking at the grounds leave you speechless. So many colors, and far more hints of other colors just under the surface. Looks like the Treasure you find after you say Open Sesame to what's his name. \n\nInhale (the tropical flavor rant ends here) is clearly in the Indica camp and very similar to many Indica doms\nExhale is at least medium thick, and you can get some really cool nose exhales going looking like your head is a Waverunner or something.\nThe Ashy Larry hit will have you questioning this recommendation. \n\nNo Anxiety, not Paranoia\nOnly Happy Thoughts, content, smiling\nBut for clarity It is a little bit Stronger than it's parent Blue Dream \nBut with no Bug Out whatsoever.\nIt's just a little more tipsy feeling than Blue Dream. \nThis is a great example of what I'd call a quality \"Medium Indica\" (Dominant Hybrid)\n\nGood for what ails you \n\nThis is a feel good/worry free strain that is acceptable for most patients ",
