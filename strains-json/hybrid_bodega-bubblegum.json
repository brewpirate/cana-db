I can tell it has stardawg in it so it's Bodega for sure. \nDecent level of sedation, I could function right now if I had to. But I don't want to, I won $500 from an AZTV contest. I'm down for the count. A 150mg sativa edible + bodega bubblegum will do that to a gal.\nI truly haven't felt this chill & care free in a long time. I know it's from the Bodega I've felt like garbage until I dabbed. It has amazing nausea curing properties.",
