            "text": "Pop music is a diverse and lenient genre that often accompanies many influences such as hip-hop, soul, dance, rap, and rock. The term \u201cpop\u201d is short for \u201cpopular,\u201d so the recognized sound of this genre has continually shifted over time. From the 60s, when The Beatles and rock music was considered pop, to today\u2019s landscape where you\u2019ll find pop artists ranging from soul singers to rappers, this lively genre will always be changing and evolving as the years wane on.\n\nPop music takes many forms, which means that there\u2019s probably an album out there that speaks solely to you. Below, explore five modern pop albums\u2014paired with their perfect strains\u2014for an elevating experience of our modern-day manifestation of an evolving genre.\nSeat at the Table by Solange\n(Columbia Records)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Dream Queen\nSolange released her third album, Seat at the Table, in 2016, and it quickly shot to the number one spot on Billboard 200. The 21-song album is an infusion of Solange\u2019s neo-soul, r&b sound. It\u2019s a refreshing number one album in a world of top 40 hits that often adhere to rigid, narrow hooks and phrasing. Seat at the Table has a deep, serene beauty from each calculated note to Solange\u2019s effortlessly melodic voice. With lyrics that speak to the black American experience and touch on topics such as prejudice and racism, A Seat at the Table is poignant, meaningful, and an important contribution to the artistic landscape of our times.\n\nMore Life by Drake\n(Republic Records)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Sage N Sour\nMore Life, Drake\u2019s 13th album, dropped in 2017. With over 80 minutes of music, it delivers an expressive and vibrant soundscape that is a delight to dive into. With songs such as \u201cMadiba Riddim,\u201d \u201cLose You,\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t Have Everything,\u201d and \u201cPassionfruit,\u201d Drake explores a wide variety of sounds that keeps it fresh and engaging throughout. Yet\u2014despite the variety\u2014each track contains Drake\u2019s quintessential style, tying it together with the genuine heart he puts into his work.\nLemonade by Beyonce\n(Columbia Records)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Electric Lemonade\nReleased in 2016, Lemonade took the music scene by storm\u2014and with good reason. A modern masterpiece, Lemonade is a deeply personal musical journey through romantic tribulations and black American life in the modern age. The album moves seamlessly through each song, leading the listener along a ride of emotional ups and downs. Anger, grief, joy, triumph, self-love\u2014Lemonade has it all. Paired with the visual album, it\u2019s easy to see why it made a major, lasting impact on the musical world.\n\nRainbow by Kesha\n(Kemosabe)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Cherry Thunder Fuck\nRainbow is Kesha\u2019s first album since 2014 due to her long legal battle with producer and abuser, Dr. Luke. Having now won back the rights to her own music, Kesha\u2019s album, Rainbow, is an anthem of freedom, triumph, and a spirit that refuses to quit. With songs such as \u201cPraying\u201d and \u201cBastard,\u201d which directly addresses the trials Kesha went through over the last few years, the album is deeply personal. On the other end, songs such as \u201cBoogie Shoes\u201d and \u201cWoman\u201d (featuring Dap Kings) are bursting with joy and strength, making Rainbow a well-rounded, emotional hit.\nThe Pinkprint (Deluxe) by Nicki Minaj\n(Republic)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Boss OG\nThe Pinkprint was released in 2014, but with Minaj hinting at a new 2018 release, there\u2019s plenty of reason to get hyped about this album all over again. With 23 songs on the roster, Pinkprint gives fans plenty to unwrap during her hiatus, and for those who only know her from the hit \u201cAnaconda,\u201d it\u2019s time to take a deeper look. The Pinkprint features a wide breadth of sound; the diverse tracks range in genre from hip-hop, soul, rap, to dance. Minaj brings all her talent to the table, showing off her skills as a great rapper and soulful singer. The contrast between songs such as \u201cFeeling Myself\u201d and \u201cGrand Piano\u201d exemplify Minaj\u2019s ability to embrace any sound she wants and she packages it all into one fire album.",
