Much of society has changed in the millennia since the destruction of the temple, but in honor of Jewish traditions, we celebrate our affinity towards the brightest beacon in the cannabis landscape: concentrates.\nSimilar to the Hanukkah miracle, just a small amount of hash oil can last for days or even weeks without you needing to return to your favorite dispensary. This of course varies from person to person depending on their tolerance, dosing, and method of consumption. And while there are no rules for what strains make the best concentrates, I have compiled a list with eight of my favorite strains that make crazy-good oil.\nTo better understand my selections, you should know what qualifications I look for when selecting a strain-specific concentrate. The first thing I concern myself with is the quality of the genetics and product used in extraction. Was the concentrate derived from trim or buds? Is it a killer phenotype of your favorite strain or is it some random bag seed? These considerations are paramount to capturing the best potency and complex flavors in oil form. The other major quality I analyze is the flavor profile of the strain. Concentrates not only condense the power of the cannabinoids, they also emphasize the immense spectrum of terpenes that cannabis can exude.\nSo keeping all that in mind, here are eight strains that can be used to make some quality hash oil. Mazel tov!\n\n1. Kosher Kush\nAn obvious choice for thematic reasons, but the pungent, piney tones of skunky Kush flavors are also exactly what I look for when selecting Kush genetics. Any number of OG Kush varieties can produce a profound mixture of flavor and potency. Kosher Kush not only fits the profile, but even your rabbi will agree the resulting effects of this indica will leave you feeling blessed.\n\n2. Sour Diesel\nBesides the incredible euphoria and happy energy of its sativa effects, Sour Diesel also emits an expansive scope of flavors. The rich diesel and citrus tones provide an invigorating terpene profile that fascinates the senses. Some Sour D phenotypes exude the sugary qualities of lemon candy or subtle watermelon sweetness that makes for an extremely pleasurable dab.\n\n3. Jillybean\nJillybean is a hybrid strain with such marvelous flavor combinations that I have a hard time passing it up no matter what form it is presented in. TGA Seeds have bred a stunning mix of Romulan, Orange Skunk, and Cinderella 99, and the tropical flavors of its parent strains turn Jillybean into a fruit salad of mango and orange. The creamsicle phenotype delivers a creamy orange mouthful of flavor that is especially nice when concentrated.\n\n4. Durban Poison\nDurban Poison is a key ingredient to the unique and renowned flavor combination found in GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies). The intense sweetness and energetic effects make Durban Poison a perfect strain to help you stay active while the oversized resin glands and the thick coat of trichomes draw concentrate enthusiasts to this sativa. With crystalline trichomes that extend to almost all areas of the plant, the trim from Durban Poison can make concentrates comparable to so some lower-yielding, bud-run concentrates, supplying yet another reason to pick this poison.\n\n5. Amnesia Haze\nAmnesia Haze produces exceptional amounts of THC, making it a prime choice for concentrate production. The mellow cerebral buzz keeps one from being totally overwhelmed, even when hit with the forceful effects that cannabis oil is known to supply. Its citrus sweetness mixes with earthy Haze flavors that provide an elevated mood and will help you forget any troubles.\n\n6. Bruce Banner #3\nSpeaking of exceptional THC content, how about Bruce Banner #3? The Incredible Hulk’s alter-ego has tested at over 25% according to High Times’ list of the “Earth’s Strongest Strains 2014.” While I have yet to personally experience this strain in concentrate form, the 3rd place prize at the 2014 Cannabis Cup held in Denver is enough to make me drool over the possibilities. The sweet skunky mix of pungent flavors deliver a euphoric buzz, while the high concentration of cannabinoids points towards exceptional yields once extracted.\n\n7. Alaskan Thunder Fuck\nAlaskan Thunder Fuck is great all-purpose strain. It is relatively forgiving to grow and the smoke is an earthy mix of pungent fruit flavors. I enjoy the way that extracts emphasize ATF’s diverse range of flavors and when properly purged, the oil created from Alaskan Thunder Fuck gives off a candied mix of citrus and banana flavors that are hard to ignore. The flavor is so compelling, you will have a hard a time putting this concentrate to rest before it does the same to you.\n\n8. Sour Tsunami\nWith so much movement in our understanding of the therapeutic abilities of cannabinoids, it seems proper to highlight a high-CBD strain. While there are a number of choices for strains like Harlequin, ACDC, and Charlotte’s Web that induce CBD’s healing properties, I think Sour Tsunami brings the most intriguing and enjoyable flavor experience. With its genetic heritage of Sour Diesel and NYC Diesel, Sour Tsunami boasts an incredible mix of pungent diesel flavors to compound its ability to quell pain and epileptic seizures.\nHave you tried any of these strain-specific concentrates?

Much of society has changed in the millennia since the destruction of the temple, but in honor of Jewish traditions, we celebrate our affinity towards the brightest beacon in the cannabis landscape: concentrates.\nSimilar to the Hanukkah miracle, just a small amount of hash oil can last for days or even weeks without you needing to return to your favorite dispensary. This of course varies from person to person depending on their tolerance, dosing, and method of consumption. And while there are no rules for what strains make the best concentrates, I have compiled a list with eight of my favorite strains that make crazy-good oil.\nTo better understand my selections, you should know what qualifications I look for when selecting a strain-specific concentrate. The first thing I concern myself with is the quality of the genetics and product used in extraction. Was the concentrate derived from trim or buds? Is it a killer phenotype of your favorite strain or is it some random bag seed? These considerations are paramount to capturing the best potency and complex flavors in oil form. The other major quality I analyze is the flavor profile of the strain. Concentrates not only condense the power of the cannabinoids, they also emphasize the immense spectrum of terpenes that cannabis can exude.\nSo keeping all that in mind, here are eight strains that can be used to make some quality hash oil. Mazel tov!\n\n1. Kosher Kush\nAn obvious choice for thematic reasons, but the pungent, piney tones of skunky Kush flavors are also exactly what I look for when selecting Kush genetics. Any number of OG Kush varieties can produce a profound mixture of flavor and potency. Kosher Kush not only fits the profile, but even your rabbi will agree the resulting effects of this indica will leave you feeling blessed.\n\n2. Sour Diesel\nBesides the incredible euphoria and happy energy of its sativa effects, Sour Diesel also emits an expansive scope of flavors. The rich diesel and citrus tones provide an invigorating terpene profile that fascinates the senses. Some Sour D phenotypes exude the sugary qualities of lemon candy or subtle watermelon sweetness that makes for an extremely pleasurable dab.\n\n3. Jillybean\nJillybean is a hybrid strain with such marvelous flavor combinations that I have a hard time passing it up no matter what form it is presented in. TGA Seeds have bred a stunning mix of Romulan, Orange Skunk, and Cinderella 99, and the tropical flavors of its parent strains turn Jillybean into a fruit salad of mango and orange. The creamsicle phenotype delivers a creamy orange mouthful of flavor that is especially nice when concentrated.\n\n4. Durban Poison\nDurban Poison is a key ingredient to the unique and renowned flavor combination found in GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies). The intense sweetness and energetic effects make Durban Poison a perfect strain to help you stay active while the oversized resin glands and the thick coat of trichomes draw concentrate enthusiasts to this sativa. With crystalline trichomes that extend to almost all areas of the plant, the trim from Durban Poison can make concentrates comparable to so some lower-yielding, bud-run concentrates, supplying yet another reason to pick this poison.\n\n5. Amnesia Haze\nAmnesia Haze produces exceptional amounts of THC, making it a prime choice for concentrate production. The mellow cerebral buzz keeps one from being totally overwhelmed, even when hit with the forceful effects that cannabis oil is known to supply. Its citrus sweetness mixes with earthy Haze flavors that provide an elevated mood and will help you forget any troubles.\n\n6. Bruce Banner #3\nSpeaking of exceptional THC content, how about Bruce Banner #3? The Incredible Hulk’s alter-ego has tested at over 25% according to High Times’ list of the “Earth’s Strongest Strains 2014.” While I have yet to personally experience this strain in concentrate form, the 3rd place prize at the 2014 Cannabis Cup held in Denver is enough to make me drool over the possibilities. The sweet skunky mix of pungent flavors deliver a euphoric buzz, while the high concentration of cannabinoids points towards exceptional yields once extracted.\n\n7. Alaskan Thunder Fuck\nAlaskan Thunder Fuck is great all-purpose strain. It is relatively forgiving to grow and the smoke is an earthy mix of pungent fruit flavors. I enjoy the way that extracts emphasize ATF’s diverse range of flavors and when properly purged, the oil created from Alaskan Thunder Fuck gives off a candied mix of citrus and banana flavors that are hard to ignore. The flavor is so compelling, you will have a hard a time putting this concentrate to rest before it does the same to you.\n\n8. Sour Tsunami\nWith so much movement in our understanding of the therapeutic abilities of cannabinoids, it seems proper to highlight a high-CBD strain. While there are a number of choices for strains like Harlequin, ACDC, and Charlotte’s Web that induce CBD’s healing properties, I think Sour Tsunami brings the most intriguing and enjoyable flavor experience. With its genetic heritage of Sour Diesel and NYC Diesel, Sour Tsunami boasts an incredible mix of pungent diesel flavors to compound its ability to quell pain and epileptic seizures.\nHave you tried any of these strain-specific concentrates?

The smell right out of the jar was a floral, strawberry zest with a hint of earth in the backdrop. To me, the best of all worlds. The Kush is there but not strong. The NYC Diesel and Strawberry Cough (Strawberry Diesel’s Mom and Dad) rock on through this one right into my top five favorites. I took one toke and wanted to own all the rest. \nLook: Light green dense nug, bright orange hairs and a fair amount of kif coating. Trimmed well and just a pretty bud with looking ‘intimidating.’\nTaste: The smell translate over to taste so well. This is why I love it so. The Razzberry, Black and Blueberry strains usually smell amazing but then some of the profile just does not transfer over. This was a smell that was near identical to the flavor. Besides the next section, I would recommend this just for flavor alone, let alone how good it made me feel.\nRecommendation for medicine: This was an uplifting ride with a smile on my mug the entire time. One great pick me up and a fairly good “kick me in the pants and do something” type strain. I think the properties of the Strawberry Cough mixed with the NYC Diesel makes this a prime candidate for depression, stress, anxiety and PTSD.
