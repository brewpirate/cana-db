Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Bubble Gum is a hybrid strain so popular, it\u2019s traveled the world from Indiana to Holland. The fruity bubble gum smell that gave this strain its name transfers into the flavor when smoked. Its effects are a quality balance between sativa and indica traits, allowing you to relax without knocking you out.\nGrow Techniques: Bubble Gum grows well in a large-scale SOG (sea of green). It is easy to manage and offers uniform growth. This hybrid clones well, making it easy to rotate your garden space and keep production moving forward. In quality soils and hydroponic setups, this strain is suitable for novice and expert growers alike.\nFlowering Time: 8-9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Easy\nClimate: Prefers temperatures between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Bubble Gum grows well indoors or outdoors, but protection from weather will help prevent mold production in the buds.\nFeeding: Use increased phosphorus levels to promote a nice finish for the buds, but ensure sufficient time to flush the nutrients and build up Bubble Gum\u2019s iconic flavor.",
