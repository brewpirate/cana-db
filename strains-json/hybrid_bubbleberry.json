Im prone to anxiety, this is something i would take during a panic attack. It doesn\u0027t make me hungry or tired which is a plus, I never felt really giggly as I was hoping I would by the reviews...But Its very calming, yet you can still function and interact. As it started to wear off I got slight paranoia though. My BF said he got a bad headache, so if you\u0027re prone to that take that into consideration. I\u0027ll defiantly try it again, I take a few more hits than usual, but the calmness of this strain is probably the best compared to others.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-60063","title":"4 Springtime Activities Enhanced With Cannabis","author":"Rae Lland","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1520633843000)\/","text":"Spring is in the air, bringing fresh flowers, warmer days, and cleansing rain. But through the waxing evenings and lazy Sundays, intensive spring cleaning, an exhaustive daylight saving switch-up, and the stress of pre-summer planning tends to make spring a tiring season. Thankfully, these trying activities don’t have to be so daunting with a little cannabis on hand.\n\nEnjoy preparing your garden or tackling that over-stuffed closet with some energizing strains that will get you in tune with the changing season. Below, discover our go-to strains for springtime activities and ease yourself into the months ahead.\nDon’t Let Daylight Saving Time Leave You Exhausted\n(anyaberkut/iStock)\nAM Strain Recommendation: Grapefruit Diesel\nPM Strain Recommendation: King Louis XIII\nDaylight Saving Time is a twice-yearly event that leads to a physical and mental adjustment for most of the country. While “spring ahead” means more sunshine, it also signals the loss of an hour of coveted sleep. Make the best of this change and avoid morning grogginess by going to bed early and giving yourself a mental boost for the morning.\nTo help you transition to this shift in time, choose a relaxing indica when you’re ready for bed. We love King Louis XIII, known for its insomnia benefits, to help the body ease into sleep an hour early. In the morning, the hybrid Grapefruit Diesel will give you a burst of energy that will leave you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as you get ready for the day right on schedule.\nFind Grapefruit Diesel Nearby\nFind King Louis XVIII Nearby\n\nMake Spring Cleaning Fun by Putting Some Pep in Your Step\n(Peopleimages/iStock)\nStrain Recommendation: Super Lemon Haze\nSpring cleaning might seem like a huge undertaking, but there’s something so satisfying about throwing open your windows and clearing the dust off your shelves in the fresh spring air. Jumping into this task is well worth it—in the end you’ll feel refreshed, your place will be spotless, and you can finally breathe a big sigh of relief.\nTo help you stay motivated as you clean top to bottom, try a stimulating sativa such as Super Lemon Haze. The lively, euphoric effects encourage focus, so you’ll be happily absorbed in your work and the spring cleaning will be done before you know it.\nFind Super Lemon Haze Nearby\n\nRelieve Lingering Winter Blues and Get Hyped for Spring\n(eclipse_images/iStock)\nStrain Recommendation: Bubbleberry\nAfter months of darkness, the beginning of spring is a welcome relief, but it isn’t enough to instantly kick the winter blues.

This hybrid provides a giggly, happy high that will make you feel closer to the sun while waiting for spring showers to bring on the other kind of flowers.\nFind Bubbleberry Nearby\n\nPair the Right Greens With Your Gardening Routine\n(eclipse_images/iStock)\nStrain Recommendation: Green Crack\nOne of the most magical times of the year is the beginning of spring since it kicks off the start of the growing season. After browsing the seed catalogue and planting your share, it’s time to prepare your garden.
