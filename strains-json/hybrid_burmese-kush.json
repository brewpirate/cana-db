In the world of the Cannabis connoisseur, this has to be the most aroma therapeutic weed. And the flavor puts this strain as one of the finest Cannabis strains. It has a pleasant pine solvent smell and taste incredibly smooth from a robust Earthy Kush flavor with an undertone of black licorice. Overall pleasant experience and excellent medication. It's on top of my list, as an all time favorite strain.",
