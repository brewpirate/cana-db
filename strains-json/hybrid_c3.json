            "text": "This is probably my favorite strain. I only had the pleasure of getting it once, but it was fantastic. I\u2019m not going to lie, when I first heard the boring name and that it was Indica dominant (I used to think I prefer Sativa, but now I know either is fantastic) I wasn\u2019t very excited about it. However, it was a great high every time. It did the trick and conserved a lot. I hope to get this again soon, totally recommend!",
