I only had the pleasure of getting it once, but it was fantastic. I’m not going to lie, when I first heard the boring name and that it was Indica dominant (I used to think I prefer Sativa, but now I know either is fantastic) I wasn’t very excited about it.

I hope to get this again soon, totally recommend!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":2,"flavors":[],"effects":[{"name":"Talkative","score":100},{"name":"Euphoric","score":100},{"name":"Giggly","score":100},{"name":"Happy","score":100},{"name":"Relaxed","score":100}],"symptoms":[],"conditions":[],"negatives":[],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/c3","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Chemdawg","subtitle":null,"slug":"chemdawg","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/chemdawg","symbol":"Cd","applink":"leafly://strain/chemdawg"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
