It is so smooth and tastes great. It smells citrusy with a tiny pungent smell at the end. \nIt is so good for EVERYTHING!  It helps with my anxiety and depression mostly and then secondly it helps with my pain and insomnia. Even though it\u0027s Indica Dominate, I don\u0027t feel the lock from it. I am still able to function.  I\u0027m Pretty disappointed that I haven\u0027t been able to purchase it for a while. Unfortunately, it hasn\u0027t been available anywhere near me for a few months now. Hoping it will return to more local dispensaries sooner than later. \n\n‚Ä¢It did make me eat like a cow though!
