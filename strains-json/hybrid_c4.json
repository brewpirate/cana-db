It smells citrusy with a tiny pungent smell at the end. \nIt is so good for EVERYTHING!  It helps with my anxiety and depression mostly and then secondly it helps with my pain and insomnia. Even though it's Indica Dominate, I don't feel the lock from it. I am still able to function.  I'm Pretty disappointed that I haven't been able to purchase it for a while. Unfortunately, it hasn't been available anywhere near me for a few months now. Hoping it will return to more local dispensaries sooner than later. \n\n\u2022It did make me eat like a cow though! I would recommend this to anyone for anything!\u2022\n\nI LOVE C4! \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udca8\ud83c\udf41\ud83d\udc9a",
