It took it\u0027s time hitting, but when it hit, I was done.  Major high for me - my mind was a little absent, all I could do was giggle and smile... maybe nod here and there.  Almost felt like I was in a lucid dream - aware of what was happening... but then not feeling like I\u0027m in my body.  Helped with muscle pain, felt like cool gel on my back muscles and spine.  Also took my headache away from a previous strain I tried.  Helped a LOT with my depression, it was like an anti-depressant on steroids.  I was not jittery, but I was able to feel energetic.  I had double vision for about the first 30 minutes, making it hard to focus.  It\u0027s really smooth when you inhale, no coughing/choking in the slightest.  I didn\u0027t experience munchies, didn\u0027t make me hungry, \u0026 nothing tasted better or worse - didn\u0027t effect my taste buds.  Coming down from the high, I did just want to lay down - not fall asleep, but just relax.  My muscles were like jello.\n\nThe taste was sweet indeed, I kept getting sour notes here and there, like licking sour patch kids candy and then it would go sweet.  I really love the taste of it, reminds me of Candy Jack, but better.  Even before vaping it, smells sweet.  Definitely worth a try, I\u0027m getting more today.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1584794,"username":"Mongo80","text":"Nice clever onset that speaks to those that like a nice little energy boost in your smoke.
