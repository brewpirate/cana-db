            "text": "Well cackle my berries! I LOVE this strain! I am simultaneously sad that my local dispensary is almost out, and happy I snagged myself a couple more grams before it was ALL gone. \n\nTaste is mostly citrus and berry up front with a sweet, piney, earthy back note. Smoke is smooth, and even though this is the last bits of the harvest, it still burns fairly long. \n\nThis is the giggliest weed I've smoked since I was a teen, and I am sure that was more circumstance than product! A fun, gregarious and uplifted mental feel with a nice body mellow. \n\n10/10 will smoke again (as soon as I can find more!)",
