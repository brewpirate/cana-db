I LOVE this strain! I am simultaneously sad that my local dispensary is almost out, and happy I snagged myself a couple more grams before it was ALL gone. \n\nTaste is mostly citrus and berry up front with a sweet, piney, earthy back note. Smoke is smooth, and even though this is the last bits of the harvest, it still burns fairly long. \n\nThis is the giggliest weed I\u0027ve smoked since I was a teen, and I am sure that was more circumstance than product! A fun, gregarious and uplifted mental feel with a nice body mellow. \n\n10/10 will smoke again (as soon as I can find more!)","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"},{"id":1571745,"username":"NL7","text":"Just da way it looked wit that purple color with white and orange hairs; I knew i had to buy it. smoked it and it feels so good. time feels to slow down...defintly make me get da giggles for sure. really good strain and da taste does hav a hint of berry/grape. dis also helps if u hav trouble talking wit ppl, makes u talkative for sure. one of my fav. strain 9/10","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":2,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":100},{"name":"Berry","score":100},{"name":"Earthy","score":100},{"name":"Grape","score":50},{"name":"Pungent","score":50}],"effects":[{"name":"Talkative","score":100},{"name":"Uplifted","score":100},{"name":"Euphoric","score":100},{"name":"Giggly","score":100},{"name":"Happy","score":100}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":100},{"name":"Stress","score":100},{"name":"Spasticity","score":50}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":50},{"name":"Migraines","score":50}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":50},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":50}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":["Caguas, Caguas, Puerto Rico"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cackleberry","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Cherry OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"cherry-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-og","symbol":"Cog","applink":"leafly://strain/cherry-og"},{"name":"Stardawg","subtitle":null,"slug":"stardawg","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/stardawg","symbol":"Sta","applink":"leafly://strain/stardawg"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
