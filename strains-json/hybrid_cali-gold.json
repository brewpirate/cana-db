Wow,\nthis \"task\" soon turned into a treat. I was loving the Christmas lights and not even minding the other shoppers. For me shopping involves the following: knowing exactly what you want, finding it, then leaving as soon as possible. But it was completely different with Cali Gold. What a great time. It kind of seems to be a slight bit hallucinatory, which made for a very cautious and slow ride home on back country roads.\nIf this strain can make shopping enjoyable, I guess it can do wonders. Very recommended.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/YEN1LqXiYCOvWiFhmP-4p67iqDM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fY9fB9qHySLml8016ysgJ_goggles-green.png"},{"id":1588451,"username":"dylkize","text":"When I first had a whiff of this Cali instant lemon citrus hit my nose.
