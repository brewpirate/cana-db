    "description": "<p>Calyx OG (also known as Calyx OG #3) is a balanced 50/50 hybrid from Calyx Garden. This strain was bred by crossing <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/platinum-calyx\">Platinum Calyx</a> with <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/true-og\">True OG</a>, creating a dense flower with a pungent aroma. The <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/terpenes-the-flavors-of-cannabis-aromatherapy\">terpene profile</a> of Calyx OG is a mixture of citrus and earthy aromas. It offers up over 1% in <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-limonene-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-this-cannabis-terpe\">limonene</a>, nearly half a percent in <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-pinene-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-this-cannabis-terpene\">pinene</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/humulene-caryophyllene-and-trans-nerolidol-what-are-the-benefits\">humulene</a>, and almost a full percent of <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/humulene-caryophyllene-and-trans-nerolidol-what-are-the-benefits\">caryophyllene</a>. This harmony of terpenes and upwards of 27% THC make for a potent flower in both effect and aroma. Calyx OG has a 60-day flowering cycle and happens to be one of Calyx Garden&rsquo;s highest yielding strains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n",
