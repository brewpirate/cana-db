            "text": "I\u2019m new to Cannabis and this was my very first trial of herb. I\u2019d had some hard candies and a couple of gummies but this was my first time smoking. My friend (a horticulturist for a local dispensary) gave me a bowl worth as I\u2019d read the reviews on Leafly and thought this would be a great strain for me. I\u2019m NOT a fan of swirly highs, being couch locked or even being drunk. I do though have pretty bad PTSD and panic attacks. I\u2019m looking for something to help smooth those out so I can deal with being in public without hyperventilating in my car. \nCannelope Kush sounded perfect. It really WAS NOT.\n\nI had one really good hit and a second kind of weak one. I very quickly felt like I had warm molasses pour down my head, shoulders and arms and then up the inside of my legs to all meet in the middle. That was pleasant enough, then it wasn\u2019t. I got tunnel vision, my vision turned pink; I saw psychedelic colors and felt like I was not here. Like I was throwing my voice and I was actually somewhere else and so was everyone else. I felt like I could take off my glasses and show him how odd everything looked because it was like a film or tv show. \n\nI also felt like I'd been shot but all over my face and shoulders. The concussion, stinging pain and gasping breaths all hit me. It felt like I had wet balloons pushed onto my body and popped or I had a MASSIVE, blistery sunburn and someone slapped me on it with all their might all over my skin. \n\nI felt like someone had hit me in the mouth with a baseball bat and broke out my teeth. I don't know if you know that sort of wet crunch when your teeth get broken but it's EXACTLY what it felt like.\n\nThere was also the sensation of an epidural albeit a really weird one. It didn\u2019t stop the use of my legs but it felt like I had slipped on a burning bikini all round my bits and that my bladder and bowels were filled with fire. Like I was scrubbing my bits inside and out with summer hot beach sand. \n\nI have to say all of this was definitely a novel experience but one I NEVER want to experience again. It put me off slightly to having more herb but being able to not have fear when I leave the house is much more stressful than having a super weird reaction to one strain. There are almost 3,000 more and I\u2019m sure I will find something to fit my needs.",
