I don\u0027t know if you know that sort of wet crunch when your teeth get broken but it\u0027s EXACTLY what it felt like.\n\nThere was also the sensation of an epidural albeit a really weird one. It didn’t stop the use of my legs but it felt like I had slipped on a burning bikini all round my bits and that my bladder and bowels were filled with fire. Like I was scrubbing my bits inside and out with summer hot beach sand. \n\nI have to say all of this was definitely a novel experience but one I NEVER want to experience again. It put me off slightly to having more herb but being able to not have fear when I leave the house is much more stressful than having a super weird reaction to one strain. There are almost 3,000 more and I’m sure I will find something to fit my needs.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/1/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/ZtQxS6XT_MjOwMadRkRsU9ZNU-I=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fX2q7eTOS7WxMAnwrLSBM_wide-brim-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":132,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":13.452380952380953},{"name":"Earthy","score":12.678571428571429},{"name":"Woody","score":11.964285714285714},{"name":"Pungent","score":7.916666666666667},{"name":"Honey","score":7.3809523809523814}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":59.3452380952381},{"name":"Happy","score":56.071428571428569},{"name":"Relaxed","score":49.345238095238095},{"name":"Tingly","score":29.94047619047619},{"name":"Focused","score":24.642857142857142}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":21.488095238095237},{"name":"Stress","score":18.86904761904762},{"name":"Fatigue","score":12.321428571428571},{"name":"Pain","score":10.952380952380953},{"name":"Insomnia","score":8.2738095238095237}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":14.285714285714285},{"name":"PTSD","score":8.6309523809523814},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":5.1190476190476186},{"name":"Asthma","score":3.8690476190476191},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":3.6904761904761907}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":38.928571428571431},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":33.63095238095238},{"name":"Paranoid","score":25.892857142857142},{"name":"Anxious","score":25.535714285714285},{"name":"Dizzy","score":25.357142857142858}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cannalope-kush_100x100_670c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/587536/b/cannalope-kush__primary_0716.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cannalope-kush_100x100_f105.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/520815/b/cannalope-kush__primary_be8f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cannalope-kush_100x100_e0ce.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/519356/b/cannalope-kush__primary_ecc5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cannalope-kush_100x100_35c9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/514379/b/cannalope-kush__primary_0f50.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cannalope-kush_100x100_0d79.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/509069/b/cannalope-kush__primary_0b4b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cannalope-kush_100x100_37ed.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/507402/b/cannalope-kush__primary_5f54.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":39,"popularCities":["Vancouver, BC","Lynnwood, WA","Spokane, WA","Chicago, IL","Seattle, WA","Wenatchee, WA","Airway Heights, WA","Everett, WA","Montréal, QC","Mount Vernon, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cannalope-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.48484848484848/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Cannalope Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"cannalope-haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/cannalope-haze","symbol":"Cah","applink":"leafly://strain/cannalope-haze"},{"name":"OG #18","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-18","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-18","symbol":"O18","applink":"leafly://strain/og-18"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":73,"outdoorFinish":"September/Early October","height":null,"averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
