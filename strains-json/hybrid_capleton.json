            "text": "Capleton strain had me taking \"Hit Pon Toppa Hit.\" I received super chunky green and purple flower that was ensconced in tricomes. Capleton is rumored to have two strain variants; one favors florals tones, whereas the other is skunky. I received the skunky version which was quite potent, and onset quickly. I experienced a crisp cerebral head change that lasted about 20 mins, then slowly migrated into my body. The physical effects included warming of the extremities, also tingling and increased tolerance to pain. This is an ideal strain for those looking to decrease physical pain and elevate sensitivity to external stimuli, such as massages, stretching, exercise, or coitus. I'd say this strain is a 60/40 sativa leaning hybrid, with a short lived head change and physical effects that increase steadily but wane after about 45 minutes. Arthritis, migraine, and anxiety suffers should rejoice, Capleton provided me with much needed relief from my symptoms. ~Thanks for reading and remember to like/follow",
