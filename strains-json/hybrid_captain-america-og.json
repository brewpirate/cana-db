Nice balance of body soothing and pain killing with an overall euphoric feeling. There was a nice amount of cerebral stimulation that brought about some deep thinking, left me feeling like I was laying on a marshmellow. Very tasty and smooth flower, little bit sweet an the smoke wasnt too heavy. Overall a very relaxing strain that combats stress and pain.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":16,"flavors":[{"name":"Berry","score":10},{"name":"Orange","score":10},{"name":"Pineapple","score":10},{"name":"Diesel","score":6.7857142857142856},{"name":"Sweet","score":5}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":25.357142857142858},{"name":"Uplifted","score":20.357142857142858},{"name":"Euphoric","score":20.357142857142858},{"name":"Creative","score":18.571428571428569},{"name":"Happy","score":15.357142857142858}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":6.7857142857142856},{"name":"Pain","score":6.7857142857142856},{"name":"Stress","score":6.7857142857142856},{"name":"Inflammation","score":5},{"name":"Insomnia","score":5}],"conditions":[{"name":"Arthritis","score":6.7857142857142856},{"name":"Anxiety","score":5.3571428571428568},{"name":"Cancer","score":5},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.7857142857142856}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":13.571428571428571},{"name":"Anxious","score":5},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.7857142857142856}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/captain-america-og_100x100_da4a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/609421/b/captain-america-og__primary_7a7a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/captain-america-og_100x100_0639.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/606540/b/captain-america-og__primary_1e71.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Calgary, AB","Hamilton, ON","MontrÃ©al, QC","Toronto, ON","Vancouver, BC","Winnipeg, MB"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/captain-america-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.5625/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
