            "text": "If you see Captain's Cake...TRY IT! This unique strain is both beautiful and powerful. \n\nA 70/30 indica lean, this strain's sativa shines when smoked in low doses. When smoked in higher doses, this will provide for a cerebral body high (if that makes sense). \n\nLast night I cheefed a 1g joint of cake after dinner and felt like it was laced with coke or some crazy sh*t. I was manic almost as if I had taken stimulants. I have NEVER experienced this type of high with captains cake and cake is consistently relaxation but, goes to show, over consumption of THC in general will make you hella crazy. Doesn't matter what strain it is. If you smoke too much, you'll be high....too much? ha, you know.\n\nBasically, it's great. Smoke a lot of it and it may not be. I guess it depends on the high you're looking for.\n\nDid I mention it's beautiful?! It's BEAUTIFUL!",
