Smell is classic indica - earthy and dank with an animalic note, yet there's a strong sweet/minty/spicy aspect that seems to really carry. The vapor from this one is thick, sweet and permeating. Overall, very pleasant aroma though problematic if you're trying to keep the smell down. The buzz is fairly long-lasting and mostly body. I find it works really well for back/leg pain as well as insomnia. No unusual or severe side effects, making it very desirable for those who want to avoid anxiety-inducing, intense mental highs. As might be expected, it makes one lazy, sleepy and hungry. ",
