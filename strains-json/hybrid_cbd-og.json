Never had a mold or insect problem,(also had pots of marigolds and tons of wild flowers nearby to help diversify the insect population plus added a couple of containers of lady bugs) At harvest 2017 one OG CBD produced over two pounds trimmed and dried. The effects on pain are good, but not long lasting unless made into an edible. This season I will try screen and topping to keep plant from getting to eleven foot again and hope to get four pound yield.",
