For all my aromatic stoners this will be a very nice scent for you to want to continuously smell! Once smoked you get a sweet light smoke. Not to dense ( used roll up ) and the high was very smooth it gradually pulled me up into the sky off of my seat. \n\nYes this one is a good one to try. If you see it you must give it a try! 5 Stars !   ",
