            "text": "Well folks, the \u201cwe have to call it the \u2018Big Game\u2019 because that other name is trademarked but we all know what the \u2018Big Game\u2019 actually refers to\u201d is taking place this Sunday in sunny Houston, Texas. For those of you who are football fans, absurdly expensive commercial fans, or just fans of hanging out with your friends so you can chow down on food and vape your favorite strain while they shake their fists and scream obscenities at the television, here\u2019s a list of some cannabis-infused recipes and strains to make Sunday even more \u201cSuper.\u201d\nCannabis-Infused Recipes for the Big Football Game\n1. Cannabis-Infused Chipotle Avocado Baked Macaroni and Cheese\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love mac and cheese? This homey dish of cannabis-infused cheesy, creamy deliciousness\u00a0will warm the bellies of your friends as they watch the Patriots and Falcons\u00a0face off.\n2. Cannabis-Infused Cucumber Avocado Dip\n\nDips are their own genre of food when it comes to watching sports. This recipe for infused cucumber avocado dip is deceptively healthy but definitely delicious.\n3. Cannabis-Infused Guacamole\n\nSpeaking of dips, guacamole is a must-have at any championship viewing party. But what\u2019s better than guacamole? Cannabis-infused guacamole, of course!\n4. Cannabis-Infused Hummus\n\nThree infused dip recipes? Why the heck not? Pair this infused hummus\u00a0with\u00a0some pita chips or\u00a0crudit\u00e9, or smear it onto chicken feta sliders.\n5. Cannabis-Infused Pesto Pizza\n\nWhip up a few pizzas with different topping combinations for instant viewing party MVP status.\n6. Cannabis-Infused Coleslaw\n\nIf you\u2019re going the BBQ route, this side dish of cannabis-infused coleslaw\u00a0makes a pairing as perfect as Brady and\u00a0Belichick.\n7. Cannabis-Infused Bacon\n\nHonestly, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do with this \u2013 it\u2019s cannabis-infused bacon,\u00a0for crying out loud. Wrap it around dates and roast them so they look like little footballs (laces out!). Make some bacon cheeseburgers. Or just put out a tray of cannabis-infused bacon \u2013 after all, bacon is pretty damn delicious.\nNote: Dosing homemade edibles can be tricky (click here to learn why), so the best way to test for potency is to start with one portion of a serving, wait one to two hours, then make an informed decision on whether to consume more. Always dose carefully and listen to your body, and never drive under the influence of cannabis.\nCannabis Strains to Pick Up for the Big Game\n1. Peaches and Cream\n\nWith\u00a0this guaranteed good-mood hybrid strain, notes reminiscent of sweet Georgia peaches come through in a flavor profile that\u00a0Atlanta fans will absolutely appreciate.\n2. American Kush\n\nFor Patriots fans, this star-spangled indica delivers happy, tingly effects to match how you\u2019ll feel if\u00a0Brady and Belichick do it again.\n3.\u00a0Southern Lights\n\nFor all you Falcons fans, this smoothly smokable sativa relaxes your body and sharpens your mind, letting you take it all in from the comfort of any given couch.\n4. Kaboom\n\nWhenever anyone takes a big hit, take an equally big hit of this\u00a0lemony sativa.\n5. Super Silver Haze\n\nSilver is a tertiary color for both teams headed to Houston, and come\u00a0Sunday those silver accents are going to be looking pretty super.\u00a0Even better,\u00a0this popular sativa will deliver the energy needed to pump you up for the opening kickoff.\n6. Champagne Kush\n\nTreachoself! When the fourth quarter clock reaches zero and the Gatorade is dumped on the winning coach, bust out this uplifting flowery hybrid and celebrate in style.\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\u201dhttp://polldaddy.com/poll/8622212/\u201d&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Who do you think will win the 2015 NFL Championship?&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;",
