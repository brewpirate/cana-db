            "text": "When cultivating cannabis, growers aim to produce a potent, fragrant bud\u2013and ideally, lots of it. Genetics, nutrients, grow mediums, climate, and many other factors are responsible for determining the yield of your garden. The first of those factors, the plant\u2019s genetics, dictate which attributes the plant is capable of expressing, while environmental factors are what help coax them out in the growing process.\nBelow are five strains with genetics that predispose them to heavy yields. Consider sowing these strains if you\u2019re looking to achieve a bigger harvest this year.\n\nWhite Widow\nWhite Widow is a famous Amsterdam hybrid that was created by crossing landrace strains from Southern India and Brazil. Now famous worldwide, White Widow is known for its impressive resin production and powerful euphoria. Consumers may celebrate its effects, but growers celebrate White Widow\u2019s large yields.\nThere\u2019s a reason why this award-winning hybrid remains popular since its birth in the 90s. Not only is this strain a heavy yielder, White Widow is resilient toward mold and pests, and flowering wraps up in just eight to nine weeks. White Widow fares best in indoor gardens, so find some seeds and watch this plant take off.\n\nCheese Quake\nCheese Quake combines the power of a quality strain with high yields. Created by TGA Subcool Seeds, this indica-dominant hybrid combines genetics from Cheese and Querkle. Its effects strike a balance between cerebral and physical, elevating the mind while saddling the body with relief. The aroma is sour and funky like cheese, with sweet fruity undertones.\nGenerally grown indoors, Cheese Quake will grow fast and big. Top this plant early on in vegetation to help it grow into a bushy shape. Low stress training (LST) and pruning will help keep this plant headed towards an epic yield of quality buds.\n\nPurple Trainwreck\nAnother outdoor California classic, Purple Trainwreck is famous for its high yields and ease of growing. This strain was created by the Humboldt Seed Organization by crossing the longtime favorite Trainwreck with Mendocino Purps. The resulting hybrid holds onto both Trainwreck\u2019s wonderful aroma and effects and Mendo Purp\u2019s weight and resilience. Purple Trainwreck offers a euphoric and uplifting high, making it a perfect strain for entry-level consumers looking for a mellow experience.\nThis strain will thrive either indoors or outdoors, with a favorable flowering time of just eight weeks. For this reason, Purple Trainwreck is a hit for light-deprivation greenhouses or growers looking to harvest early in the fall.\n\nCritical Kush\nCritical Kush was created by breeding two legendary strains, Critical Mass and OG Kush. Its parent strain Critical Mass is known for its sweet citrus flavor while OG Kush brings to the table earthy flavors and potency. With their forces combined, Critical Kush inherits potency, flavor, and heavy yields.\nAny moisture influx will cause Critical Kush\u2019s buds to mold from the inside out, which is why this strain needs to be grown in a space where humidity can be precisely regulated. For this reason, growing indoors or in a greenhouse is recommended. Heavy feeding is necessary to ensure the buds grow dense, healthy, and heavy.\n\nBlue Dream\nBlue Dream is regarded as the most popular strain in the United States. This hybrid is heavy-yielding, mildew-resistant, flavorful, easy to find, and calming in effects. Due to its overwhelming presence and pacifying, mellow euphoria, Blue Dream is popular among novice consumers. However, many connoisseurs and heavy consumers have moved past the Blue Dream hype.\nHaving been bred for outdoor farming in California, Blue Dream reaches its full potential under the sun. It responds well to a Mediterranean climate and takes off vertically. Blue Dream grows lanky and tall, but produces dense buds which help to make its yields exceptional.\n\nThe quality of Blue Dream varies widely depending on how it was grown, hence why so many connoisseurs steer toward other genetics. As a popular high-yielding strain, many cultivators grow Blue Dream as a cash crop without putting enough attention towards the quality of the product. Try finding a quality Blue Dream and see if this changes your opinion.\nWhile this is a short list of popular, high-yielding strains, there are so many others out there begging to be discovered, grown, and celebrated. As farming tactics and technology improve, yields will continue to increase. But don\u2019t forget that behind any high-yielding crop is a capable farmer who pays attention to his or her plant\u2019s needs.\nWhich heavy yielders would you add to this list? Drop a comment below for other curious growers.",

This was the same knee cap I dislocated twice before and destroyed the MCL last year in it with meniscus tearing, so pretty impressive anti inflammatory and pain relief med and the very strong relaxing sensation that comes with is fantastic great for deep sleep too but doesn't really make me tired for such a strong indica I tasted smooth thick smoke with very chemically taste and slight tea tree very nice nug structure and density I will be using this strain for any and all pain or would mix it with grape ape if I had knee pain with vertigo. the overall high was very overpowering and strong but I wanted that anyway. great high, taste, and medicinal benefits  try it out regardless of the fact it's indica it's really nice and should get more recognition ",
