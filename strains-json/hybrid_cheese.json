I was scared to smoke it lol, but it did the trick and I went from puking and dry heaving, to eating everything in sight! I\u0027m now cancer free and I think I owe most of it to Marijuana.

I mean, sure, you can have a good time while being sober, but you can have a great time while being lifted.\nSo with that said, I curated a list of suggested strains for you to indulge in, depending on which sport you’re going to see. Peep the list, use Leafly’s Finder to locate the dispensaries stocking these strains, purchase, and enjoy some good ol’ sportsball.\nStrains to Pair With Exciting Sports (Basketball, Football, Soccer, Hockey)\nSports that fall under this category are the types of sports that include constant back and forth action, which keeps you engaged from start to finish. A big play is always looming, so you’re stuck to the edge of your seat because you don’t want to miss that big dunk or the chance to yell “GOOOOAAALLLLL” in the face of whoever’s sitting next to you. For that reason, you should indulge in strains that’ll have you uplifted and energetic, feeling hyped and ready for that big moment.\n  Candyland\nCandyland’s a high-THC, sativa-dominant hybrid that’ll have you super smacked without the paranoia. As a mix of Grandaddy Purple and Platinum GSC, it’s got an earthy type of scent and a sweet flavor, with effects that will have you uplifted, engaged, and in a whole entire world of euphoria. Smoke these before an exciting sport and those big plays will feel that much bigger.\nFind Candyland Nearby\n  Green Crack\nEveryone knows how good, energized, and focused Green Crack can make you feel. It’s one of those strains that you can smoke and power through the day like you drank 84 cold brews, so it’s perfect to smoke before a sporting event that you want to be locked into.\nFind Green Crack Nearby\n  Cotton Candy Kush\nCotton Candy Kush is another high-THC strain that leaves you feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good, like Outkast on “GhettoMusick.” As a mix of Power Plant and Lavender, its powerful effects are relaxing yet still energetic while inducing happiness, freedom, and overall euphoria, so you’ll be that much more excited when you see that Ronaldo bicycle kick for the game-winning goal live and in person.\nFind Cotton Candy Kush Nearby\n  Stardawg\nStardawg is one of the best smelling, best tasting, most euphoric, most energetic, most everything strains I’ve ever come across. Gifted to me by LTRMN in Portland, I smoked this and walked around the city for hours, falling in love with everything and everybody. It’s definitely a strain I’d recommend smoking before a sporting event, because every single dunk, touchdown, and goal will likely feel like the greatest moment in sports history for you.\nFind Stardawg Nearby\nStrains to Pair With Chill Sports (Baseball, Golf, Tennis)\nSports that fall under this category tend to be a lot more laid-back and reserved. Baseball games can be long and boring, and golf and tennis matches require damn near complete silence, with light clapping being the most excited you can get, so if you’re overly hyped at any of them, you may feel a bit uncomfortable or out-of-place. These strains will help you lean a little more towards the indica side of things.\n  Obama Kush\nObama Kush is a great indica with a relatively mild THC percentage that’ll chill you out without knocking you out. I smoked a gram joint of Obama Kush a few weeks ago and knocked out the entire first season of Girls Incarcerated on Netflix, which is still shorter than one full-length baseball game.\nFind Obama Kush Nearby\n  Larry OG\nLarry OG is a hybrid of OG Kush and SFV OG, whose indica effects will overtake your body and have you with your feet in the air like your Cares-to-Give Meter is at zero. Smoke a little of this and you’ll have no problem sitting through an entire round of golf, where the most exciting thing possible is a fox running across the course.\nFind Larry OG Nearby\n  Cheese\nCheese is an indica-dominant hybrid that:\n\nactually smells like Cheese, which is wild; and\nwill have you feeling relaxed while avoiding the sleepy sleepy nap nap state of mind.\n\nYou can smoke some Cheese and kick back in comfort for hours, so if you’re going to see one of the chill sports where everything’s deathly silent and calm, Cheese is a good strain to indulge in beforehand.\nFind Cheese Nearby","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/15152818/strains-before-sports-event.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/try-these-strains-before-attending-your-next-sporting-event"},{"id":"contentitems-32474","title":"Tips for Growing Blue Cheese Cannabis","author":"Leafly Staff","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1498601692000)\/","text":"Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and General Hydroponics are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Blue Cheese is a heavy indica strain that was created by crossing UK Cheese and Blueberry. The strain offers a funky cheese-like aroma combined with a unique blueberry scent. It’s a potent strain commonly used by medical patients for pain management.\nGrow Techniques: Grow Blue Cheese indoors or outdoors in any medium. You can train the plants to increase yields or top them to help round out the growth. Blue Cheese is a vigorous grower and strong plant that easily resists mold and infections, making it a good choice for novice growers.\nFlowering Time: 7-8 weeks\nYield: Moderate\nGrow Difficulty: Easy to moderate\nClimate: Prefers cool to moderate temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Growing Blue Cheese indoors allows you to easily train the plant.
