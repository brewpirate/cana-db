One legendary strain and the other making its way to the annals of cannabis royalty, Chem Jack is a potent sativa dom hybrid. With THC levels reaching 25-27%, and a 65/35 sat/ind ratio, Chem Jack provides cloudless cerebral effects, that may gradually fade south if consumed throughout the day and into the night. Look for Liiiight-green flowers contrasted by brown pistols, and ensconced in trichomes. Concerning the terpene profile of this strain, the main aroma is sweet  pine. Both Chem Dawg and Jack Herer are renowned for their alpha-pinene and beta-pinene content. Pinene is known to support alertness, information retention, promote lung health, and act as an antiseptic; moreover, Chem Jack is loaded with it. I enjoyed this strain for almost a month. I administered early mornings upon waking, and often didn\u0027t not require coffee to feel alert. The effects could be described as mood enhancing; providing unabated optimism and lucid and coherent thinking. Anxiety suffers: the pinene content counteracts some of the effects of THC, so rejoice and partake in this soon to be cannabis connoisseurs\u0027 treat. ~remember to like/share...T H A N K Y O U.......................................................","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1435401,"username":"mortymcfly","text":"Great cerebral high and hits fast.
