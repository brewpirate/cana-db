According to chemdog, one ounce was seedless and the other had 13 seeds.\r\n\r\nIn \u201991, chemdog popped the first 4 seeds. From these seeds, one male was found and disposed of (chemdog was young, you can\u2019t blame him). The 3 females were labeled \u2018chemdawg\u2019 (now \u201991 chemdawg), \u2018chemdawg a\u2019 (now chemdawg\u2019s sister), and \u2018chemdawg b\u2019. In \u201801, chemdog and his girlfriend attempted to germ 3 more seeds, labeled \u2018c\u2019, \u2018d\u2019, and \u2018e\u2019. the \u2018e\u2019 seed never germinated, \u2018c\u2019 turned out to be junk (according to chemdog), and chemdawg \u2018d\u2019 was the keeper. In \u201806, \u2018chemdog\u2019 and \u2018joebrand\u2019 reunited and joe was given 4 of the last 6 beans: Chemdawg phenos 1-4, \u20184\u2032 being the chosen keeper. Joe thought the \u20184\u2032 was the best representation of the original and thus dubbed it the \u2018reunion pheno\u2019. Chemdog still has two seeds left in his stash.",

It\u2019s good! \ud83d\ude1c. Suuuuper feeling vape making you feel like the whole world is absolutely still for a moment. But also your head is going faster then warp speed. Perhaps into flannel or beyond kinda speeds. When you listen with your ears for the first time. That\u2019s how good your hearing becomes. I hear the crickets and also someone who just farted like ten km from hear. So good. But the next 3 hours will be led completely by the music your playing in the background of your life.                    - \ud83e\udde0LeVvels",
