According to chemdog, one ounce was seedless and the other had 13 seeds.\r\n\r\nIn â€™91, chemdog popped the first 4 seeds. From these seeds, one male was found and disposed of (chemdog was young, you canâ€™t blame him). The 3 females were labeled â€˜chemdawgâ€™ (now â€™91 chemdawg), â€˜chemdawg aâ€™ (now chemdawgâ€™s sister), and â€˜chemdawg bâ€™. In â€˜01, chemdog and his girlfriend attempted to germ 3 more seeds, labeled â€˜câ€™, â€˜dâ€™, and â€˜eâ€™. the â€˜eâ€™ seed never germinated, â€˜câ€™ turned out to be junk (according to chemdog), and chemdawg â€˜dâ€™ was the keeper. In â€˜06, â€˜chemdogâ€™ and â€˜joebrandâ€™ reunited and joe was given 4 of the last 6 beans: Chemdawg phenos 1-4, â€˜4â€² being the chosen keeper. Joe thought the â€˜4â€² was the best representation of the original and thus dubbed it the â€˜reunion phenoâ€™. Chemdog still has two seeds left in his stash.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1614996,"username":"Levvels","text":"Ooooooookay.
