In true family spirit, this hybrid has a very strong diesel smell with a piney-lemon aftertaste. Most Chemdawg 91 crops tend to lean sativa, though you may find indica variants on some dispensary and retail shelves. Consumers should expect a cerebral buzz from this strain.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n","aka":"Chem 91, Chem ‘91, Chemdawg ‘91, Chemdog 91, Chemdog ‘91, Chem Dog 91, Chem Dog ‘91, Chem Dawg 91, Chem Dawg ‘91, Chem91, 91 Chemdawg, 91 Chemdog, 91 Chem Dawg, 91 Chem Dog, ‘91 Chemdawg, ‘91 Chemdog, ‘91 Chem Dawg, ‘91 Chem Dog, Skunk VA","rating":4.55,"highlightedReviews":[{"id":1414358,"username":"GhostOfJack","text":"One of my top 10, love the musky lemon aged socks dipped lightly in diesel and rubbed on a skunk funk.  Funked, Chunked, and gunked.  Always brings the gunk to the grinder, stickiest of the ickiest, divinity to infinity, the buzz has legs and goes the distance.  Happy mellow high with a punch of light body stone.  Reminds me of Sour D and Kush mixed into 0ne.  Higher doses give the silly willys n get ya lost in oblivion and creativity without direction.  Smoke too much and you may end up stacking bannanas thinkin ur picasso while those around you think.. wtf?..:)","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/ZtQxS6XT_MjOwMadRkRsU9ZNU-I=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fX2q7eTOS7WxMAnwrLSBM_wide-brim-green.png"},{"id":1639672,"username":"michaelwilliam90","text":"in my opinion a more mild strain, PERFECT  for daytime/afternoon.
