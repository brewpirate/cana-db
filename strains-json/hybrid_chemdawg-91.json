Always brings the gunk to the grinder, stickiest of the ickiest, divinity to infinity, the buzz has legs and goes the distance.  Happy mellow high with a punch of light body stone.  Reminds me of Sour D and Kush mixed into 0ne.  Higher doses give the silly willys n get ya lost in oblivion and creativity without direction.  Smoke too much and you may end up stacking bannanas thinkin ur picasso while those around you think.. wtf?..:)",
