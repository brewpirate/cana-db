Whether your sunny days are spent loafing beachside or adventuring mountainside, we’re here to help you build up your summer arsenal of cannabis necessities. The following are just a few of our favorites—and don’t forget to chime in with your own faves by leaving a comment down below!\n1. Chernobyl\n(Leafly)\nA versatile sativa-dominant hybrid that radiates with the smell of fresh lime, lemon, and orange peel, Chernobyl’s aroma alone will awaken the senses while letting your body melt like an ice cream cone in the sun. With upbeat effects that put a spring in your step, Chernobyl elevates the senses to help you appreciate the sound of music, the beauty of nature, and the company of good friends.\n\n2. Cannabis-Infused Beverages\n(Courtesy of Sprig)\nCracking an ice-cold beer in the sun is great, but a cooler full of cannabis-infused beverages is better. Brands vary from state to state, but some names to look out for include:\n\nLegal Sodas (WA, OR): With Legal Sodas, you have the ability to choose your flavor (think lemon ginger, Rainier cherry, and pomegranate), effect (indica, sativa, CBD, etc.), and strength (10mg, 20mg, and more). Functional, creative, and social, these infusions are destined to be enjoyed under the summer sun.\nSprig (CA): Light in flavor but heavy in effect (unless, for you, 45mg of THC ain’t no thang), Sprig offers a citrusy, bubbly flavor that could easily be made into the perfect summer mocktail.\nDixie Elixirs (CO, NV, AZ): With flavors like Cherry Limeade, Berry Lemonade, and classic Fruit Punch, these 100mg sparkling coolers are perfect for sharing with friends while out and about.\n\n\n3. Super Lemon Haze\n(Leafly)\nLooking for a strain that’ll leave your mind floating lazily along with the clouds above? Super Lemon Haze is a dreamy sativa-dominant strain that’ll do just that. Its flavor is loud with lemon zest—we suggest packing this one into a pre-roll and hitting the trail with a few of your loved ones. You’ll relish the heightened appreciation it brings to the natural beauty surrounding you.\n4. Vape Cartridges\n(Courtesy of Select)\nA no-brainer for the mobile consumer, vape cartridges are a great way to enjoy your favorite herb without the burden of clunky or messy equipment. As small and discreet as a ballpoint pen, vape cartridges are perfect for outdoor activities. Brands vary between states, but a few of our favorites include:\n\nEvolab (CO)\nSelect Cannabis Oil (OR)\nTimeless Vapes (CA)\nMarley Natural (WA, OR, CA)*\n\n\n5. Chocolope\n(Leafly)\nA buzzy sativa that stays light on the limbs, Chocolope is the strain for anyone looking to stay active for dancing, summer sports, or whatever else you do under the sun. Imbuing the mind with warm feelings of comfort and creativity, Chocolope offers flavors of sweet earth and spice with fruity undertones.\n6. Tinctures\n(mphillips007/iStock)\nYet another portable and discreet way to enjoy cannabis on the go, tinctures are liquid concentrates that are dropped or sprayed under the tongue for fast-acting euphoria. They come in a variety of flavors and potencies, so the experience is really up to you. Mix them into a fruity drink to create a mocktail, or cut the fluff and go straight under the tongue. Some tinctures we recommend personally are Ethos Innovates Journey Tincture (WA) and Cascadia Herbals (OR).\n*Editor’s note: Marley Natural and Leafly are both owned by Privateer Holdings.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/10141439/summer-products-header.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/cannabis-products-for-summer-july-2017"},{"id":"contentitems-3802","title":"Which Cannabis Strains Give You the Best Bud for Your Buck?","author":"Rebecca Kelley","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1466725500000)\/","text":"With thousands of cannabis strains to choose from, it can often feel overwhelming choosing a variety you\u0027ll enjoy that won\u0027t cost a lot of money. Do some cannabis strains give you a better bang for your buck than their high-priced alternatives? We dove into our data to find out. \nAfter analyzing all of the strains in our database, we came up with a list of the best reasonably priced options. The criteria for our list included the following requirements: \n\nThe strains must be equal to or lower than a median price of $12.88 per gram\nStrains must have at least 100 user reviews and a median rating of 4.3 or higher to indicate popularity and general quality\nStrains must be available on at least 50 dispensary menus, indicating decent availability\n\nWith those parameters in mind, we charted the results of our data dive.\n\nClick on the graph for an enlarged version\n \nAccording to our research, the best budget-friendly strains are: \n\nBlue Magoo\nPennywise\nG13\nBlue Diesel\nObama Kush\nMK Ultra\nCritical Kush\nWhite Widow\nDeath Star\nLSD\nACDC\nAlaskan Thunder Fuck\nChernobyl\nCherry Pie\nBruce Banner\nAlien OG\nPineapple Express\n\nThese are all strains that are priced somewhat lower than other options on dispensary menus (both recreational and medical) across the country. Generally, solid mid-shelf strain options are priced at about $13 – $15 per gram, with prices occasionally creeping past $15 depending on the dispensary (although going above $15/gram won\u0027t necessarily bring you more potent or higher-quality cannabis).\n\n \nPrice-Conscious Hybrids are Popular\n\nThe most popular varieties on this list are ones I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve heard of: White Widow, Chernobyl, Cherry Pie, and Pineapple Express all enjoy strong menu availability and a large number of user reviews. These varieties, like many of the other options we pulled, are hybrid strains, which is not terribly surprising. Pure strains can be hard to come by these days with the increasing availability of so many hybrid crosses. Jeremiah, our resident strain researcher and former budtender, argues that hybrid popularity isn\u0027t necessarily a bad thing, pointing out that hybrids can breed fantastic combinations such as Cherry Pie, which, in his words, \"encapsulates disparate elements in one helluva package.\"\n \nBe on the Lookout for These Crowd-Pleasers\n\nSome of the strains on this list are crowd-pleasers that are on a lower number of menus compared to the popular hybrids listed above, but have a high rating and disproportionately large number of reviews. If you pop into a dispensary and see G13, MK Ultra, Critical Kush, Alaskan Thunder Fuck, Bruce Banner, or Alien OG on display, you may want to give them a try. \n \nWant a Reasonably Priced CBD Strain?\n\nIf you\u0027re looking for a budget-friendly high-CBD strain, ACDC is the one most likely to leave you thunderstruck. It\u0027s the lone CBD option on this list, indicating that it could be friendlier to your wallet than other higher-priced CBD-specific strains.\n\n \nBusiness Takeaways\n\nIf you\u0027re a dispensary manager, you might want to look into procuring some of these budget strains, as they\u0027re all consumer favorites. Despite being lower-priced than mainstays like Blue Dream or the latest big Cannabis Cup winner, stocking what people like at attractive prices will keep them coming back for repeat transactions. Plus, if you can get your hands on some of the crowd-pleasers we outlined above, you\u0027re potentially widening your clientele, as those strains have a growing fan base. \n\nOf course, for you consumers out there, our data suggests these strains tend to trend on the cheaper side, but pricing is ultimately determined by the dispensary, so you may end up seeing some of these varieties priced differently than what we\u0027ve charted. Let us know what are some of your favorite budget buds in your area and we\u0027ll see how your picks compare to our data!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/16214755/which-cannabis-strains-give-you-the-best-bud-for-your-buck.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/which-cannabis-strains-give-you-the-best-bud-for-your-buck"}],"reviewCount":684,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":26.007827513851609},{"name":"Lemon","score":21.835828161129363},{"name":"Sweet","score":16.169038458195086},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":14.727173763318341},{"name":"Earthy","score":13.47658365730655}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":79.94468717360283},{"name":"Uplifted","score":68.28432611565141},{"name":"Relaxed","score":63.828607804511421},{"name":"Energetic","score":57.7506496181195},{"name":"Euphoric","score":55.639106542721}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":29.997579395169758},{"name":"Stress","score":29.113289655458328},{"name":"Depression","score":24.254493832807086},{"name":"Fatigue","score":14.66705984778274},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":11.364104436393594}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":32.315642857811532},{"name":"Migraines","score":12.515964624398359},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":12.103893429194635},{"name":"PTSD","score":9.2058543865772791},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":6.5133995856887426}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":34.359883757474122},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":11.9979752509873},{"name":"Anxious","score":7.6266437712220858},{"name":"Paranoid","score":6.0636150997596792},{"name":"Dizzy","score":2.9671800756138103}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/chernobyl/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/chernobyl/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chernobyl_100x100_6bb1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1005325/b/chernobyl__primary_d0cd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chernobyl_100x100_0166.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/676399/b/chernobyl__primary_047c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chernobyl_100x100_8af5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/644171/b/chernobyl__primary_33b1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chernobyl_100x100_7565.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/624471/b/chernobyl__primary_71b1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chernobyl_100x100_2f75.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/624404/b/chernobyl__primary_d120.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chernobyl_100x100_0825.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619115/b/chernobyl__primary_75da.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":162,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Seattle, WA","Eugene, OR","Las Vegas, NV","Salem, OR","Medford, OR","Spokane, WA","Springfield, OR","Everett, WA","Beaverton, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/chernobyl","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.39327485380117/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Trainwreck","subtitle":null,"slug":"trainwreck","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck","symbol":"Tw","applink":"leafly://strain/trainwreck"},{"name":"Trinity","subtitle":null,"slug":"trinity","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/trinity","symbol":"Tri","applink":"leafly://strain/trinity"},{"name":"Jack the Ripper","subtitle":null,"slug":"jack-the-ripper","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/jack-the-ripper","symbol":"Jtr","applink":"leafly://strain/jack-the-ripper"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":63,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Jeremiah, our resident strain researcher and former budtender, argues that hybrid popularity isn\u0027t necessarily a bad thing, pointing out that hybrids can breed fantastic combinations such as Cherry Pie, which, in his words, \"encapsulates disparate elements in one helluva package.\"\n \nBe on the Lookout for These Crowd-Pleasers\n\nSome of the strains on this list are crowd-pleasers that are on a lower number of menus compared to the popular hybrids listed above, but have a high rating and disproportionately large number of reviews. If you pop into a dispensary and see G13, MK Ultra, Critical Kush, Alaskan Thunder Fuck, Bruce Banner, or Alien OG on display, you may want to give them a try. \n \nWant a Reasonably Priced CBD Strain?\n\nIf you\u0027re looking for a budget-friendly high-CBD strain, ACDC is the one most likely to leave you thunderstruck. It\u0027s the lone CBD option on this list, indicating that it could be friendlier to your wallet than other higher-priced CBD-specific strains.\n\n \nBusiness Takeaways\n\nIf you\u0027re a dispensary manager, you might want to look into procuring some of these budget strains, as they\u0027re all consumer favorites. Despite being lower-priced than mainstays like Blue Dream or the latest big Cannabis Cup winner, stocking what people like at attractive prices will keep them coming back for repeat transactions. Plus, if you can get your hands on some of the crowd-pleasers we outlined above, you\u0027re potentially widening your clientele, as those strains have a growing fan base. \n\nOf course, for you consumers out there, our data suggests these strains tend to trend on the cheaper side, but pricing is ultimately determined by the dispensary, so you may end up seeing some of these varieties priced differently than what we\u0027ve charted.

Whether your sunny days are spent loafing beachside or adventuring mountainside, we’re here to help you build up your summer arsenal of cannabis necessities. The following are just a few of our favorites—and don’t forget to chime in with your own faves by leaving a comment down below!\n1. Chernobyl\n(Leafly)\nA versatile sativa-dominant hybrid that radiates with the smell of fresh lime, lemon, and orange peel, Chernobyl’s aroma alone will awaken the senses while letting your body melt like an ice cream cone in the sun. With upbeat effects that put a spring in your step, Chernobyl elevates the senses to help you appreciate the sound of music, the beauty of nature, and the company of good friends.\n\n2. Cannabis-Infused Beverages\n(Courtesy of Sprig)\nCracking an ice-cold beer in the sun is great, but a cooler full of cannabis-infused beverages is better. Brands vary from state to state, but some names to look out for include:\n\nLegal Sodas (WA, OR): With Legal Sodas, you have the ability to choose your flavor (think lemon ginger, Rainier cherry, and pomegranate), effect (indica, sativa, CBD, etc.), and strength (10mg, 20mg, and more). Functional, creative, and social, these infusions are destined to be enjoyed under the summer sun.\nSprig (CA): Light in flavor but heavy in effect (unless, for you, 45mg of THC ain’t no thang), Sprig offers a citrusy, bubbly flavor that could easily be made into the perfect summer mocktail.\nDixie Elixirs (CO, NV, AZ): With flavors like Cherry Limeade, Berry Lemonade, and classic Fruit Punch, these 100mg sparkling coolers are perfect for sharing with friends while out and about.\n\n\n3. Super Lemon Haze\n(Leafly)\nLooking for a strain that’ll leave your mind floating lazily along with the clouds above? Super Lemon Haze is a dreamy sativa-dominant strain that’ll do just that. Its flavor is loud with lemon zest—we suggest packing this one into a pre-roll and hitting the trail with a few of your loved ones. You’ll relish the heightened appreciation it brings to the natural beauty surrounding you.\n4. Vape Cartridges\n(Courtesy of Select)\nA no-brainer for the mobile consumer, vape cartridges are a great way to enjoy your favorite herb without the burden of clunky or messy equipment. As small and discreet as a ballpoint pen, vape cartridges are perfect for outdoor activities. Brands vary between states, but a few of our favorites include:\n\nEvolab (CO)\nSelect Cannabis Oil (OR)\nTimeless Vapes (CA)\nMarley Natural (WA, OR, CA)*\n\n\n5. Chocolope\n(Leafly)\nA buzzy sativa that stays light on the limbs, Chocolope is the strain for anyone looking to stay active for dancing, summer sports, or whatever else you do under the sun. Imbuing the mind with warm feelings of comfort and creativity, Chocolope offers flavors of sweet earth and spice with fruity undertones.\n6. Tinctures\n(mphillips007/iStock)\nYet another portable and discreet way to enjoy cannabis on the go, tinctures are liquid concentrates that are dropped or sprayed under the tongue for fast-acting euphoria. They come in a variety of flavors and potencies, so the experience is really up to you. Mix them into a fruity drink to create a mocktail, or cut the fluff and go straight under the tongue. Some tinctures we recommend personally are Ethos Innovates Journey Tincture (WA) and Cascadia Herbals (OR).\n*Editor’s note: Marley Natural and Leafly are both owned by Privateer Holdings.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/10141439/summer-products-header.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/cannabis-products-for-summer-july-2017"},{"id":"contentitems-3802","title":"Which Cannabis Strains Give You the Best Bud for Your Buck?","author":"Rebecca Kelley","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1466725500000)\/","text":"With thousands of cannabis strains to choose from, it can often feel overwhelming choosing a variety you\u0027ll enjoy that won\u0027t cost a lot of money. Do some cannabis strains give you a better bang for your buck than their high-priced alternatives? We dove into our data to find out. \nAfter analyzing all of the strains in our database, we came up with a list of the best reasonably priced options. The criteria for our list included the following requirements: \n\nThe strains must be equal to or lower than a median price of $12.88 per gram\nStrains must have at least 100 user reviews and a median rating of 4.3 or higher to indicate popularity and general quality\nStrains must be available on at least 50 dispensary menus, indicating decent availability\n\nWith those parameters in mind, we charted the results of our data dive.\n\nClick on the graph for an enlarged version\n \nAccording to our research, the best budget-friendly strains are: \n\nBlue Magoo\nPennywise\nG13\nBlue Diesel\nObama Kush\nMK Ultra\nCritical Kush\nWhite Widow\nDeath Star\nLSD\nACDC\nAlaskan Thunder Fuck\nChernobyl\nCherry Pie\nBruce Banner\nAlien OG\nPineapple Express\n\nThese are all strains that are priced somewhat lower than other options on dispensary menus (both recreational and medical) across the country. Generally, solid mid-shelf strain options are priced at about $13 – $15 per gram, with prices occasionally creeping past $15 depending on the dispensary (although going above $15/gram won\u0027t necessarily bring you more potent or higher-quality cannabis).\n\n \nPrice-Conscious Hybrids are Popular\n\nThe most popular varieties on this list are ones I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve heard of: White Widow, Chernobyl, Cherry Pie, and Pineapple Express all enjoy strong menu availability and a large number of user reviews. These varieties, like many of the other options we pulled, are hybrid strains, which is not terribly surprising.
