I will (shamelessly I might add) get baked and munch on nothing but straight up maraschino cherries. Yeah. I\u0027m that guy. \n\nSo this strain has an AMAZING smell. Unmistakably cherry, with some earthy/woody undertone. It was the first bud to impress me that much on smell alone in quite a while. Very unique.\n\nAs far as taste goes, I really expected this to be sweeter than it was. Which is to say that it\u0027s mildly sweet on the inhale, but very heavy earthy taste on the exhale. \n\nEffects wise, I\u0027d rate this about a 60/40, slightly Sativa dominant strain. Pleasant effects, fairly alert mentally, nice body buzz without too much drowsiness. Good for daytime, but also an alright as just a relax and unwind at the end of the day strain.\n\n4/5 only because it wasn\u0027t too special effects wise.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"},{"id":1638625,"username":"lisamh","text":"Great for relaxing but doesnt make you pass out","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/tAHHcVjF5EvieYWgrsxPA0WBCr8=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fRAbBXkNBSHOIMMxhio7k_wide-brim-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":25,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":38.368983957219257},{"name":"Tree Fruit","score":15.441176470588236},{"name":"Rose","score":15.441176470588236},{"name":"Berry","score":13.368983957219253},{"name":"Citrus","score":12.5}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":94.6524064171123},{"name":"Uplifted","score":88.502673796791441},{"name":"Euphoric","score":82.620320855614978},{"name":"Relaxed","score":70.120320855614978},{"name":"Focused","score":43.582887700534762}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":42.713903743315505},{"name":"Depression","score":36.096256684491983},{"name":"Headaches","score":25},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":17.713903743315509},{"name":"Cramps","score":14.772727272727273}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":48.596256684491983},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":27.941176470588236},{"name":"PTSD","score":27.941176470588236},{"name":"Arthritis","score":15.441176470588236},{"name":"Cancer","score":12.5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":21.323529411764707},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":5.88235294117647}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cherry-cookies_100x100_9241.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/647598/b/cherry-cookies__primary_a73d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cherry-cookies_100x100_7b8a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/647597/b/cherry-cookies__primary_5595.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cherry-cookies_100x100_c7d2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/646156/b/cherry-cookies__primary_9329.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cherry-cookies_100x100_c622.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/552281/b/cherry-cookies__primary_b273.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cherry-cookies_100x100_9d4f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/529259/b/cherry-cookies__primary_f963.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":5,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA","Detroit, MI","San Francisco, CA","Spokane, WA","San Diego, CA","Anaheim, CA","Caguas, Caguas, Puerto Rico","Fremont, CA","Hayward, CA","Irvine, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cookies","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.68/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Cherry Pie","subtitle":null,"slug":"cherry-pie","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-pie","symbol":"Cp","applink":"leafly://strain/cherry-pie"},{"name":"Girl Scout Cookies","subtitle":null,"slug":"girl-scout-cookie","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/girl-scout-cookie","symbol":"Gsc","applink":"leafly://strain/girl-scout-cookie"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
