Tasted even better just amplified from the smell. Caped in the volcano. Little goes a long way. Felt relaxed, not lazy. Felt happy, good, general sense of well being. Troubles melted away. I felt very sexual and making love was amazing. Touch was so sensitive. No let down, just a trail of good feelings the rest of the day, or until the next session. Always pick this up if u see it.

            "text": "A great Indica don hybrid that knocks me out. A darker shatter, but still potent and flavorful, the fist thing that comes to mind when I smell the oil is a spicy/sweet cherry cigar. The initial high is definitive hybrid, but after about 20 minutes the indica begins to drag down. I cannot use this during the day as it will definitely make me take a nice nap. Medically it helps with pain quite well, but no other relief really. A great nighttime strain to cash out with.",
