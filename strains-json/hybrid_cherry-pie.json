            "text": "Psychedelic rock was born out of 1960s psychedelia culture that embraced mind-altering hallucinogens in an increasingly globalized world. The resulting music was eclectic, experimental, and mentally stimulating\u2014the kind of music that is candy for the mind.\n\nToday, these influences continue to thrive in the music of modern psychedelic rock musicians, who often incorporate other genres such as world, jazz, electronic, and pop for a fresher feel. Enjoy the following psychedelic rock albums with a loaded pipe in hand and get lost in a groovy mind-altering experience.\nSpace Is Still the Place by The Bright Light Social Hour\n(Courtesy of The Bright Light Social Hour)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Headband\nSpace Is Still the Place, released in 2015, is The Bright Light Social Hour\u2019s latest album and an excellent illustration of their modern psychedelic sound. Hailing from Austin, Texas, the band features bass, guitar, synth, drums, and two vocalists: Together, they create a landscape of tight beats and instrumentation that veers into the otherworldly. The album invites you to explore different dimensions with a touch of grunge, a little grime, and lots of spacey, psychedelic mind-melting sounds.\n\nSketches of Brunswick East by King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard\n(Courtesy of King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Cherry Pie\nKing Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard is an eclectic psychedelic rock band with a wide range of sounds and genres represented in their extensive catalogue of music (in 2017 alone, the band released four distinct concept albums). Of those, Sketches of Brunswick East stands out for its jazzy space themes. The vocals are light and airy, and whispered harmonies flow into each other, creating a musical journey that grabs the listener and pulls them swiftly along a river of psychedelic tunes. If there\u2019s one album from the King Gizzard collection to give a listen, Sketches of Brunswick East is it.\nHarsh Toke by Earthless\n(Courtesy of Earthless)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Kushberry\nHarsh Toke features only two songs, but combined they present listeners with a half hour of mostly instrumental psychedelic rock. The first track, \u201cAcid Crusher,\u201d starts off slow\u2014the melodic tune takes its time to build and bend. Its trance-like vibes encourage a surrendering to the music; close your eyes and you\u2019ll feel as if you\u2019re drifting away. The second track, \u201cMount Swan,\u201d picks up a heavier rock feel and vocals before plunging into an eclectic space and then back into trance-like homeostasis. In its journey through the soundscape, Harsh Toke is sure to delight all the senses.\n\nThe Desaturating Seven by Primus\n(Courtesy of Primus)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Sour Alien\nPrimus\u2019s 2017 album\u00a0The\u00a0Desaturating Seven\u00a0hits hard with Les Claypool\u2019s famous brand of psychedelic rock. The album features Claypool\u2019s distinctive bass and vocals at its epicenter, snatching the listener up before pulling them down the rabbit hole like Alice on her way to Wonderland. The tight grooves encourage movement and emotional release that is unique to bands creating a heavier rock tone. Claypool once described Primus as \u201cpsychedelic polka,\u201d and The\u00a0Desaturating Seven is a keen example of this description, as well as an example of Primus\u2019s unique niche in the musical world.\nPainting With by Animal Collective\n(Courtesy of Animal Collective)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Mother\u2019s Helper\nPainting With, released in 2016, is the latest album by Animal Collective. As per their unique style, Painting With is a distinctive representation of psychedelic rock, featuring elements of pop, indie, and experimental music combined for an eclectic listening experience. Working with a wide array of instruments from synthesizers to drums, the band creates an intensely rich sound that listeners can practically swim in. Rising above the wildly intricate instrumentation are shifting harmonies by all four band members, their voices as bubbly, playful, and trippy as their music. Overall, Painting With provides a soundscape that takes the listener on an experimental journey worth the ride.",

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and\u00a0General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: The combination of Durban Poison and Granddaddy Purple, two highly popular strains, resulted in this sweet and tart-tasting hybrid. Cherry Pie offers a well-balanced high that will allow you to function throughout the day without feeling bogged down.\nGrow Techniques: Cherry Pie can be grown indoors or out, ideally in soil. It is a clone-only strain, which can make it difficult to acquire, and it is known to have problems self-pollenating. Closely regulating the grow space will help lower the odds of this happening. Prune the plant slowly in cycles so that the plant does not feel shocked or stressed, which often causes hermaphroditic formations. Grown right, Cherry Pie proves to be resistant to diseases and pests.\nFlowering Time: 8-9 weeks\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Prefers warmer temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, but keep the humidity low during flowering (40-50% RH).\nIndoor/Outdoor: Does well in indoors and out. When nights are warm, try growing Cherry Pie outdoors in soil.\nFeeding: Organics will help the plant get its nutrients without stressing it too much. If you have a solid understanding of nutrients, start slow and observe the plant\u2019s response.",
