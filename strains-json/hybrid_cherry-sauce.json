It tends to be a more euphoric, uplifting, motivating, and cerebral high, so while it is also nice to smoke while relaxing, I wouldn't recommend it before sleeping. Not to mention that doing so would be such a waste of a strain meant to be enjoyed more actively.\n\nThe taste is sweet and spicy, and a little floral with an almost syrupy consistency after smoked that makes the name \"Cherry Sauce\" quite apt. It's not as harsh of a strain as some others can be, which is also a definite bonus.\n\nAs for the bud itself, its a light green, rather dense, soft/fuzzy, and of course just soaked in trichomes. It's not very pungent and some of the flavor notes when smoked are not present when smelled, but it still has that addictingly sweet smell that cannabis always has.\n\nDefinitely a strain I would recommend and would continue to get in the future.",
