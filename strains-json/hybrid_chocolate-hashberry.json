About 10 minutes later I got really hungry and went downstairs and made some beer cheese popcorn and ate a whole bowl full. Then I waited like an hour and vaped some more and I was starving so I went down and ate 400 calories worth of hummus, a bunch of cheddar cheese, some prosciutto, an apple, and then I decided to eat bunch of flourless chocolate torte. I'm regretting that right now. I'm not really regretting it that much though. It tasted good and I'm very relaxed",
