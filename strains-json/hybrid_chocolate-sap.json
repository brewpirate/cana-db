            "text": "Tangie and Gorilla Glue #4 are a match made in cannabis heaven. Chocolate Sap has the Chocolate Diesel genetics sneaking through that gives it a warm cocoa aroma, a little skunk, and some citrus. Tangie's presence manifests in Chocolate Sap's effects. You may expect a nice cerebral buzz accompanied by somatic effects including pain relief, greater awareness of mind/body connection, and increased mobility in joints and muscles. This strain is a must have for sufferers of chronic pain, and decreased mobility because of stiff and achy joints and muscles. \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf",

            "text": "I rolled up some  chocolate sap in a cone and went on a short hike. This strain is great for doing any kind of physical activity because it puts your mind in an uplifted and euphoric state, but it doesn't weigh your body down with that couch lock effect. Once I smoked it, I noticed that it definitely helped me  feel an immense sense of appreciation and happiness for the nature that was around me. Also made me talkative and put me in a state of general calmness. I'd definitely recommend trying this strain especially in the day time.",
