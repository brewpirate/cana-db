It was so worth the drive I can\u0027t begin to tell you! Lol don\u0027t know what that other person had but it surly was not Chong star, since there is only one place to buy it in all of Colorado, and that\u0027s at Marisol Therapeutics in pueblo, Colorado. So the actual bud structure was a bit small but the way it burns make up for it. My wife and I smoked one regular sized joint from a rolling machine, it was still going 30 mins later with plenty to hold on to and the high was seriously the best high I have ever experienced!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"},{"id":1612474,"username":"kimbo5068","text":"Chn....Chong Star available in Pueblo Colorado @\nMarisol Therapeutic Gardens","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3145","title":"How Would You Describe 2015 Using Strain Names?","author":"Rebecca Kelley","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1452039720000)\/","text":"Before 2015 drew to a close, we turned to Facebook to ask our followers to sum up the year in one strain. Some of you opted to share your laundry lists of strains consumed, with one Leafly fan rattling off 17 strains he tried last year (and they say cannabis consumers have poor memories). Others simply responded by naming their favorite strain, with Super Lemon Haze, White Rhino, Dr. Who, Jack Herer, Blue Dream, GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), Dutch Treat and many others cracking the list. \nOur favorite responses, however, were the strains that could truly summarize 2015. Without further ado…\n \nSkywalker\nThis indica-dominant hybrid basically sums up the last month of 2015, when Star Wars fever eclipsed the globe. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is the seventh film in the iconic series (fourth if, like most of us, you conveniently choose to forget that episodes 1-3 ever existed) and picks up about 30 years after the conclusion of \"Return of the Jedi.\" Since its release date on Dec. 18, the movie has made over $750 million domestically and $1.5 billion worldwide. The relaxing and happy Skywalker could be the perfect chaser to seeing the film, helping you drift off to sleep dreaming of galaxies far, far away.\n\n \nSnoop Dogg OG / Chong Star\n2015 was a big year for cannabis-positive celebrities, with several announcing their own line of cannabis products. Snoop Dogg and Tommy Chong are two cannabis veterans-turned-entrepreneurs, with Snoop launching Leafs by Snoop and Chong debuting pre-rolled cones. Naturally, both legends have their own strain, which is why we feel both Snoop Dogg OG and Chong Star exemplify last year\u0027s growing trend of celebrity product lines. \n\n \nTrainwreck\nWhether you attribute this hybrid to the madness known as the 2016 presidential election, the continuing implosion of celebrities like Justin Bieber and Shia LaBeouf, hot-button topics like gun control or Amy Schumer\u0027s hit comedy of the same name, Trainwreck is an apt description of 2015\u0027s many milestones. Considering the strain can deliver euphoric and happy effects, we\u0027ll go with the latter and suggest pairing it with an evening viewing of the summer hit that grossed over $110 million and introduced people to LeBron James\u0027 more humorous side. \n \nLiberty Haze\nSpeaking of the 2016 election, this past year had us all in a bit of a Liberty Haze, making us want to reach for this potent hybrid as we ponder the possibility of a Trump presidency. With so many candidates and an excruciatingly long election cycle, expect to see even more craziness in 2016 as we march towards the November election. One thing\u0027s for sure: Cannabis is shaping up to be a hot topic for the politicians. \n\n \nGame Changer\nIndeed, last year was a Game Changer for cannabis, with the introduction of the CARERS Act (even though it\u0027s now stalled in committee), the debut of recreational cannabis in Oregon, Canada\u0027s election of a cannabis-positive prime minister who intends to legalize cannabis nationwide, and many more milestones. This year is destined to be an even bigger one for the movement, with a number of states eyeing legalization. You better pick up some of this hybrid and buckle up for what\u0027s bound to be a wild ride for the industry this year.\n\n \nHonorable Mention: Rosin Tech\nOkay, so it\u0027s not technically a strain, but interest in rosin gained momentum in 2015 as cannabis consumers started to get concentrate-curious. Since rosin is a safer, DIY-version of solventless concentrate that can resemble shatter, people are reaching for their hair straighteners in an attempt to \"press\" their luck in making a batch of their own.\n\nWhich strain do you think best sums up 2015?
