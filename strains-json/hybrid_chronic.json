Nathan Deal, a Republican in the final year of his last term. Georgia law gives Deal 40 days to decide whether to sign or veto legislation, or allow it to become law without his name.\n\nThe House and Senate adjourned a few minutes after midnight, which used to be considered a hard deadline to end the session. But in recent years, lawmakers have worked beyond it.\n\nSenators voted 38-14 in favor of widening the cannabis oil program and establishing a joint study commission to analyze medical marijuana.\nThe Senate had weeks ago stripped PTSD and intractable pain from the bill, but the House added it back Thursday afternoon as Rep. David Clark gave a fiery speech accusing Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of being “corrupt” and “playing games” with people’s lives by blocking the program’s expansion, which could save the lives of soldiers suffering after serving their country.\n“If you can’t lead the Senate, then you sure can’t lead a state,” said Clark, who served in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report. “There are lives at stake. This isn’t a game. … People are dying.”\nCagle’s spokesman declined to comment.\n\nHours later, while introducing the new version of the bill, Sen.

David Clark, the bill’s sponsor, accused Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, a leading Republican gubernatorial candidate and the president of the Senate, of “playing politics” and stifling the proposal by instead calling for another study committee on medical marijuana. He and other lawmakers who support the measure joined the news conference.\n“This is what, our third study committee? I think we have enough evidence from the states that have passed this to know that it’s helping people,” Clark, a Buford Republican and Army veteran, told The Associated Press after the news conference.\nThose suffering from PTSD who have access to cannabis oil are less likely to turn to highly addictive opioid painkillers, Clark said.\nThere are currently nearly 4,000 Georgians who are legally allowed to have low-THC cannabis oil, although many have complained that it’s difficult to get access to it because it cannot be cultivated in the state, Rep. Allen Peake said.\n\nIn a statement, Cagle said he has supported previous legislation that expanded cannabis oil access. He also said he wants the study committee to examine how to make the medication more accessible to those with prescriptions.\n“I’m committed to supporting responsible legislation that ensures Georgians who can benefit from this medication have safe, secure and reliable access,” Cagle said.\nSen. Renee Unterman is the chairwoman of the Health and Human Services committee, where Clark’s proposal has languished. Unterman said the bill is likely dead for this legislative session, which ends March 29. She said she is instead focused on expanding accessibility through the study committee.\n\nTwo of Cagle’s Republican rivals in the race, Clay Tippins and Sen. Michael Williams, attended the news conference in support of the bill.\nTippins, a businessman and former Navy SEAL, also used it as an opportunity to blast Cagle.\n“(Proposing a study committee) is taking an important issue in an election year, giving it lip service and quietly killing it and acting like something is being done,” Tippins said.\nAfter the news conference, a group of advocates filed into Cagle’s office to confront him about the issue. Cagle’s personal assistant told the group that Cagle was busy the rest of the day, but that they could call to schedule a meeting later on the issue.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20110804/medical-marijuana-advocates-fuming-over-georgia-ptsd-bill.jpg","urlslug":"/news/politics/medical-marijuana-advocates-outraged-over-georgia-ptsd-bill"}],"reviewCount":161,"flavors":[{"name":"Woody","score":9.27353896103896},{"name":"Sweet","score":6.412337662337662},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":6.2094155844155843},{"name":"Earthy","score":6.1891233766233764},{"name":"Pungent","score":4.3425324675324681}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":76.3961038961039},{"name":"Uplifted","score":72.966720779220779},{"name":"Focused","score":66.412337662337663},{"name":"Relaxed","score":29.03409090909091},{"name":"Giggly","score":28.384740259740262}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":80.470779220779221},{"name":"Pain","score":72.556818181818187},{"name":"Headaches","score":65.275974025974023},{"name":"Inflammation","score":62.211850649350652},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":12.637987012987011}],"conditions":[{"name":"Migraines","score":64.565746753246756},{"name":"Arthritis","score":60.426136363636367},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":14.991883116883116},{"name":"Hypertension","score":10.568181818181818},{"name":"Multiple Sclerosis","score":10}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":96.3961038961039},{"name":"Dizzy","score":13.348214285714285},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":8.6241883116883109},{"name":"Paranoid","score":6.5543831168831161},{"name":"Headache","score":3.9975649350649349}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chronic_100x100_bc1a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/671882/b/chronic__primary_95af.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chronic_100x100_20a6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/589903/b/chronic__primary_8c80.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chronic_100x100_cf94.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/555123/b/chronic__primary_107d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chronic_100x100_fa85.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/521882/b/chronic__primary_7d88.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chronic_100x100_940f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/501006/b/chronic__primary_0f7d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chronic_100x100_a71d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/485302/b/chronic__primary_327f.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":34,"popularCities":["Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Toronto, ON","Amsterdam, NH, Netherlands","Bend, OR","Brampton, ON","Corvallis, OR","Edmonton, AB","Eugene, OR","Hamilton, ON"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/chronic","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.41614906832298/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Northern Lights","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights","symbol":"Nl","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights"},{"name":"AK-47","subtitle":null,"slug":"ak-47","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47","symbol":"Ak","applink":"leafly://strain/ak-47"},{"name":"Skunk #1","subtitle":null,"slug":"skunk-1","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1","symbol":"Sk1","applink":"leafly://strain/skunk-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":63,"outdoorFinish":"Mid October","height":null,"averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tA 33-day veg cycle is recommended\n\tPrefers a pH level between 6.2 and 6.8\n\tYields typically fall around 600 grams per meter squared\n\tCan be grown outdoors, but should be somewhat sheltered for protection\n\n"}}
