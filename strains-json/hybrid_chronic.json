            "text": "Before the gavel fell on this year\u2019s legislative session early Friday, Georgia lawmakers OK\u2019d an expansion to the state\u2019s medical cannabis oil program that will add post-traumatic stress disorder and intractable pain as qualifying conditions.\nAttention now turns to Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican in the final year of his last term. Georgia law gives Deal 40 days to decide whether to sign or veto legislation, or allow it to become law without his name.\n\nThe House and Senate adjourned a few minutes after midnight, which used to be considered a hard deadline to end the session. But in recent years, lawmakers have worked beyond it.\n\nSenators voted 38-14 in favor of widening the cannabis oil program and establishing a joint study commission to analyze medical marijuana.\nThe Senate had weeks ago stripped PTSD and intractable pain from the bill, but the House added it back Thursday afternoon as Rep. David Clark gave a fiery speech accusing Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of being \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cplaying games\u201d with people\u2019s lives by blocking the program\u2019s expansion, which\u00a0could save the lives of soldiers suffering after serving their country.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t lead the Senate, then you sure can\u2019t lead a state,\u201d said\u00a0Clark, who served in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report.\u00a0\u201cThere are lives at stake. This isn\u2019t a game. \u2026 People\u00a0are dying.\u201d\nCagle\u2019s spokesman declined to comment.\n\nHours later, while introducing the new version of the bill, Sen. Matt Brass took to the Senate floor to denounce the comments Clark had made in the House. Brass said Clark had acted like a \u201cchild pitching a fit.\u201d\nClark, a former Army Ranger, says those suffering from PTSD who have access to cannabis oil are less likely to turn to highly addictive opioid painkillers.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Medical marijuana advocates expressed outrage Monday over the apparent stalling of a proposal that would expand Georgia\u2019s low-THC medical cannabis oil program to include those with post-traumatic stress disorder or chronic, intractable pain.\n\nMembers of the Georgia\u2019s Hope advocacy group held a news conference inside the state Capitol and questioned why the bill, which passed the House overwhelmingly last month, hasn\u2019t gotten a Senate committee hearing.\n\nRep. David Clark, the bill\u2019s sponsor, accused Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, a leading Republican gubernatorial candidate and the president of the Senate, of \u201cplaying politics\u201d and stifling the proposal by instead calling for another study committee on medical marijuana. He and other lawmakers who support the measure joined the news conference.\n\u201cThis is what, our third study committee? I think we have enough evidence from the states that have passed this to know that it\u2019s helping people,\u201d Clark, a Buford Republican and Army veteran, told The Associated Press after the news conference.\nThose suffering from PTSD who have access to cannabis oil are less likely to turn to highly addictive opioid painkillers, Clark said.\nThere are currently nearly 4,000 Georgians who are legally allowed to have low-THC cannabis oil, although many have complained that it\u2019s difficult to get access to it because it cannot be cultivated in the state, Rep. Allen Peake said.\n\nIn a statement, Cagle said he has supported previous legislation that expanded cannabis oil access. He also said he wants the study committee to examine how to make the medication more accessible to those with prescriptions.\n\u201cI\u2019m committed to supporting responsible legislation that ensures Georgians who can benefit from this medication have safe, secure and reliable access,\u201d Cagle said.\nSen. Renee Unterman is the chairwoman of the Health and Human Services committee, where Clark\u2019s proposal has languished. Unterman said the bill is likely dead for this legislative session, which ends March 29. She said she is instead focused on expanding accessibility through the study committee.\n\nTwo of Cagle\u2019s Republican rivals in the race, Clay Tippins and Sen. Michael Williams, attended the news conference in support of the bill.\nTippins, a businessman and former Navy SEAL, also used it as an opportunity to blast Cagle.\n\u201c(Proposing a study committee) is taking an important issue in an election year, giving it lip service and quietly killing it and acting like something is being done,\u201d Tippins said.\nAfter the news conference, a group of advocates filed into Cagle\u2019s office to confront him about the issue. Cagle\u2019s personal assistant told the group that Cagle was busy the rest of the day, but that they could call to schedule a meeting later on the issue.",
