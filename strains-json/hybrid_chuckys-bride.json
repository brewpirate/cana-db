Here are five of the most popular submissions we received, so give them a rating and review if you\u0027ve tried them.\nRemember, you can check to see if these strains are available near you by clicking the \"Availability\" tab on our website and app, so go out there and find these new additions to try!\n   1. Spirit of \u002776\nCharacteristics of Spirit of \u002776:\n\nSpirit of 76 is a hybrid bred by Kindman out of Denver, CO, who closely guard the genetic heritage of their proprietary strains. It is known for having hints of purple coloring and a fruity bouquet of flavors ranging from sweet notes of fruit punch to the piney musk associated with Kush strains. Spirit of 76’s earthy taste finishes with notes of grape and lavender flavors that usher in balanced effects, which are great for relaxing, calming anxieties, and stimulating the appetite.\n\n   2. Blue Knight\nCharacteristics of Blue Knight:\n\nBlue Knight is a rare indica-dominant strain with a noble lineage that stems from Blueberry and Kryptonite genetics. Hues of royal purple twist with deep blues and vivid greens in a visual display as multifaceted as its berry, vanilla aroma. Earthy, woody, and blueberry flavors are unleashed on the exhale, and the relaxing full-body effects that follow are often enough to soothe pain and stimulate the appetite.\n\n   3. Alpha Blue\nCharacteristics of Alpha Blue:\n\n​Alpha Blue, also known as Dream Diesel (or DD), is a high-flying sativa that combines Blue Dream and Sour Diesel. In 2011 this compelling blend claimed two 2nd place prizes for a sativa at the High Times’ Medical Cup in Denver and San Francisco. Its buds are glazed with sugary trichomes and take on hues of deep red and violet. The aroma is a combination of tart blueberry and sour candy that create a pungent mixture of earthy berry and Haze upon exhale. The sweet fragrance of Alpha Blue brings with it uplifting effects that produce a calming, relaxed mood without putting you to sleep. The cerebral and happy buzz is a great tool when coping with stress and anxiety.\n\n   4. Sugar Black Rose\nCharacteristics of Sugar Black Rose:\n\nSugar Black Rose is a cross of Critical+ and Black Domina bred by Delicious Seeds. An indica-dominant hybrid, Sugar Black Rose has a sweet taste with hints of fruit and fresh flowers. The aroma takes on a pungent, earthy musk that resembles exotic hash imported from overseas, and brings with it a relaxing body buzz that helps keep nausea, anxiety, and muscle pains at bay.\n\n   5. Chucky\u0027s Bride\nCharacteristics of Chucky\u0027s Bride:\n\nChucky’s Bride is a cross of Exodus Cheese and Cinderella 99 bred by Eskobar Seeds. This sativa-dominant hybrid gives off an exotic mixture of sharp flavors. Cinderella 99’s tropical aroma of sweet citrus and pineapple blend with the pungent notes of skunky cheese that have become synonymous with Cheese strains.

Spirit of \u002776\nCharacteristics of Spirit of \u002776:\n\nSpirit of 76 is a hybrid bred by Kindman out of Denver, CO, who closely guard the genetic heritage of their proprietary strains. It is known for having hints of purple coloring and a fruity bouquet of flavors ranging from sweet notes of fruit punch to the piney musk associated with Kush strains. Spirit of 76’s earthy taste finishes with notes of grape and lavender flavors that usher in balanced effects, which are great for relaxing, calming anxieties, and stimulating the appetite.\n\n   2. Blue Knight\nCharacteristics of Blue Knight:\n\nBlue Knight is a rare indica-dominant strain with a noble lineage that stems from Blueberry and Kryptonite genetics. Hues of royal purple twist with deep blues and vivid greens in a visual display as multifaceted as its berry, vanilla aroma. Earthy, woody, and blueberry flavors are unleashed on the exhale, and the relaxing full-body effects that follow are often enough to soothe pain and stimulate the appetite.\n\n   3. Alpha Blue\nCharacteristics of Alpha Blue:\n\n​Alpha Blue, also known as Dream Diesel (or DD), is a high-flying sativa that combines Blue Dream and Sour Diesel. In 2011 this compelling blend claimed two 2nd place prizes for a sativa at the High Times’ Medical Cup in Denver and San Francisco. Its buds are glazed with sugary trichomes and take on hues of deep red and violet. The aroma is a combination of tart blueberry and sour candy that create a pungent mixture of earthy berry and Haze upon exhale. The sweet fragrance of Alpha Blue brings with it uplifting effects that produce a calming, relaxed mood without putting you to sleep. The cerebral and happy buzz is a great tool when coping with stress and anxiety.\n\n   4. Sugar Black Rose\nCharacteristics of Sugar Black Rose:\n\nSugar Black Rose is a cross of Critical+ and Black Domina bred by Delicious Seeds. An indica-dominant hybrid, Sugar Black Rose has a sweet taste with hints of fruit and fresh flowers. The aroma takes on a pungent, earthy musk that resembles exotic hash imported from overseas, and brings with it a relaxing body buzz that helps keep nausea, anxiety, and muscle pains at bay.\n\n   5. Chucky\u0027s Bride\nCharacteristics of Chucky\u0027s Bride:\n\nChucky’s Bride is a cross of Exodus Cheese and Cinderella 99 bred by Eskobar Seeds. This sativa-dominant hybrid gives off an exotic mixture of sharp flavors. Cinderella 99’s tropical aroma of sweet citrus and pineapple blend with the pungent notes of skunky cheese that have become synonymous with Cheese strains. The unique terpene profile leads a charge of uplifting and creative effects that stimulate the appetite and ward off depression.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12002401/new-strains-alert-spirit-of-76-blue-knight-alpha-blue-sugar-black.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-spirit-of-76-blue-knight-alpha-blue-sugar-black"}],"reviewCount":5,"flavors":[{"name":"Pungent","score":30},{"name":"Lemon","score":25},{"name":"Flowery","score":25},{"name":"Ammonia","score":5},{"name":"Citrus","score":5}],"effects":[{"name":"Giggly","score":60},{"name":"Happy","score":60},{"name":"Energetic","score":55},{"name":"Euphoric","score":55},{"name":"Talkative","score":30}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":50},{"name":"Stress","score":30},{"name":"Headaches","score":25},{"name":"Depression","score":10},{"name":"Insomnia","score":5}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":5},{"name":"Migraines","score":5},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":5},{"name":"Tinnitus","score":5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":10},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":5}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chucky-s-bride_100x100_6242.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/470417/b/chucky-s-bride__primary_fdeb.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chucky-s-bride_100x100_1687.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/394704/b/chucky-s-bride__primary_5407.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/chuckys-bride","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.6/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Exodus Cheese","subtitle":null,"slug":"exodus-cheese","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/exodus-cheese","symbol":"Exo","applink":"leafly://strain/exodus-cheese"},{"name":"Cinderella 99","subtitle":null,"slug":"cinderella-99","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderella-99","symbol":"C99","applink":"leafly://strain/cinderella-99"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\t7-8 weeks flowering time\n\n"}}
