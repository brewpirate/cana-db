            "text": "Chunky Diesel is one of the best sativa-dominant hybrid strains in Illinois! Its strong diesel aroma blends with chocolatey undertones   to create a smooth yet distinct flavor suitable for any palate. Although it's certainly sativa-leaning, its Deep Chunk lineage mitigates the mental stimulation associated with a traditional Sativa, producing an effect suitable for both day and nighttime usage. I highly recommend Chunky Diesel to any licensed medical cannabis patient seeking a flavorful medicine with a well-balanced high.",
