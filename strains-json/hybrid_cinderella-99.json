            "text": "It\u2019s important to celebrate our heroes. Real or imaginary, these men and women help us define our ideal selves. Sometimes these heroes are imbued with superhuman abilities, like the power of flight or telepathy, but much of the time, the attributes that make a superhero are inherently human. Heroes are characters that stand up for the weak and defenseless. They go beyond the call to raise up their fellow man. Heroes are not indestructible, but simply willing to give more of themselves without the need of thanks or admiration.\nYes, heroes are among us and within us, and on this day devoted to Superman, the \u00dcbermensch, I\u2019ve curated a shortlist of strains that will imbue you with superhuman sensations that will hopefully enable you to do something heroic\u2026or at least conquer the villainous forces of laziness and depression. Up, up, and away!\n\u00a0\nAllen Wrench\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis strain is pow!!! Gets you a super uplifting high with a great taste and smooth smoke not very harsh at all even when the bowl is almost ass and still tastes good and the smell is unbelievable super earthy citrus and could smell it from across my house, great strain won\u2019t regret.\u201d \u2013 sillbillybro\n\u00a0\nMaui\n\u00a0\n\u201cBeautiful strain came on subtle and took over my whole body for a wonderful ride. I have permanent nerve damage due to an IED this stuff makes me feel like superman.\u201d \u2013 Dungy51\n\u00a0\nKryptonite\n\n\u201cYup. So that\u2019s what Superman feels like when he is flying. I got a top shelf, frosty, extra strength dose of this stuff. I hit in a vape\u2026 Pure, tasty and then BOOM! This stuff is no joke. . .tread lightly.\u201d \u2013 Rhobert\n\u00a0\nSuperman OG\n \n\u201cFaster than a speeding bowl-hit, more powerful than locomotive, it\u2019s Superman OG! This wax is dank. Be sure to get it while it lasts at Delta-9 Association in San Jose.\u201d \u2013 tgigrass\n\u00a0\nIncredible Hulk\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery tasty, high energy strain. Perfect morning smoke to get your day started and the creative juices flowing, but smoke any more than a bowl and it hits you like a train with an incredibly strong cerebral high. Oh, and have some snacks ready because this shit is guaranteed to give you some extreme munchies.\u201d \u2013 absentia882\n\u00a0\nChemdawg\n\u00a0\n\u201c8/10: I like this one a lot. She\u2019s very much like an OG Kush but more leaning on the lighter side in terms of effects. She\u2019s not gonna get ya stoned out ya brains, but what she does offer you is a nice full body high and the ability to eat 1,467,279 cheeseburgers and fries. So smile, relax, and just know everything\u2019s gonna be just fine J\u201d \u2013 beelzebub\n\u00a0\nCinderella 99\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2018I am, I am, I am Superman, and I can do anything\u2019\u2026 are not just lyrics from the R.E.M. song, but that\u2019s how you will feel after smoking Cinderella 99. I felt like Superman flying over Market Street in San Francisco. It was an uplifting feeling. When I came back down to earth, I got wobbly legs and a pretty bad case of paranoia, all the people on the sidewalk with their shopping bags, the street performers were making me feel dizzy. That lasted maybe five minutes, then I felt like that first time you got baked, I mean really high. Time slows down, and you feel like everyone in the world knows you\u2019re high. Fun times. I highly recommend for absolutely eliminating anxiety, stress, and aches and pains, just don\u2019t overdo it. Go easy with this one.\u201d \u2013 blackhawks15\n\u00a0\nWhile these strains might not make you leap over a building in a single bound, shoot lasers out of your eyes, or tear a phone book in half, they should pack a physical stimulation that encourages a sense of wellbeing that traverses the sativa/hybrid/indica continuum. Each strain is suited for a series of semi-heroic deeds that may include making a cape out of bed sheets or other household objects, jumping on a trampoline while wearing said cape, and donning a fist-forward flying motion while walking/running anywhere. Go forth, do good, and live on!\n\u201cI\u2019m not a prophet or a stone aged man, just a mortal with potential of a superman. I\u2019m living on.\u201d \u2013 David Bowie",

Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Bred by Mr. Soul of Brothers Grimm, Cinderella 99 is the powerhouse cross between Shiva Skunk and Jack Herer. Also known as \u201cCindy 99,\u201d this hybrid strain offers an uplifting cerebral high paired with a fruity flavor.\nGrow Techniques: Cinderella 99 is a great option for growing indoors because of its size and stature. It\u2019s popular for either hydroponic or soil-based growing, but the strong aromas and flavors are best realized in soil. The strain needs to be topped and trained if you want a bushy, even canopy.\nFlowering Time: 8 weeks\u00a0\nYield: High\u00a0\nGrow Difficulty: Easy to moderate\nClimate: A consistent climate will help this strain hold onto its flavor. Try to keep it between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Though popularly grown indoors where conditions are better controlled, Cindy 99 can also be cultivated outdoors.\u00a0\nFeeding: Feed with organic nutrients through compost teas and top dressing. If Cindy 99 is planted into a quality soil, this plant will do well without much help.",
