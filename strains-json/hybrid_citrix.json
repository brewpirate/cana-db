Her buds tend to bloom in dark purple hues illuminated by fiery orange hairs and a shining white coat of crystal resin. Novice consumers may want to approach this THC powerhouse with caution, but those armed with a high tolerance will delight in Gelato’s heavy-handed euphoria. Physical relaxation comes on strong, but many find themselves still mentally agile enough to stay productive and creative when enjoying Gelato during the day.\n\nClick here for a full list of dispensaries and recreational shops carrying Gelato\n \n 5.

Lemon Marmalade took home the prize for Best BHO – THC at the 2015 DOPE Cup in Seattle and rumor has it the flower has tested upwards of 30% THC.

The effects from Lemon Marmalade come on quick with a euphoric burst of heady energy that quickly levels off into a more relaxing full-bodied experience.\n\n ","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12002031/new-strains-alert-citrix-cannasutra-gelato-lemon-alien-dawg-and-m.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-citrix-cannasutra-gelato-lemon-alien-dawg-and-m"}],"reviewCount":81,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":103.06493506493507},{"name":"Lime","score":50.974025974025977},{"name":"Grapefruit","score":41.81818181818182},{"name":"Lemon","score":37.922077922077925},{"name":"Orange","score":33.545454545454547}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":76.714285714285708},{"name":"Energetic","score":68.818181818181813},{"name":"Tingly","score":58.5974025974026},{"name":"Uplifted","score":50.090909090909093},{"name":"Relaxed","score":47.168831168831169}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":71.1948051948052},{"name":"Fatigue","score":59.246753246753244},{"name":"Stress","score":50.519480519480517},{"name":"Pain","score":45.272727272727273},{"name":"Headaches","score":6.64935064935065}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":41.220779220779221},{"name":"PTSD","score":34.298701298701296},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":27.324675324675326},{"name":"PMS","score":27.324675324675326},{"name":"Migraines","score":6.9740259740259738}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":6.64935064935065},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":6.2727272727272734},{"name":"Anxious","score":5.2987012987012987},{"name":"Headache","score":2.3246753246753249},{"name":"Paranoid","score":0.32467532467532467}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrix_100x100_51c2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/462975/b/citrix__primary_e965.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrix_100x100_fc1f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/459523/b/citrix__primary_a516.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrix_100x100_5576.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/428178/b/citrix__primary_f884.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrix_100x100_3e1c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/416236/b/citrix__primary_b9bc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrix_100x100_5d7f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/416171/b/citrix__primary_5321.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrix_100x100_468e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/415725/b/citrix__primary_c813.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":19,"popularCities":["Chicago, IL","Phoenix, AZ","Tucson, AZ","Addison, IL","Effingham, IL","Elmwood Park, IL","Englewood, CO","Fountain Hills, AZ","Gunnison, CO","Homewood, IL"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/citrix","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.24691358024691/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Grapefruit","subtitle":null,"slug":"grapefruit","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit","symbol":"Grf","applink":"leafly://strain/grapefruit"},{"name":"LA Confidential","subtitle":null,"slug":"la-confidential","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/la-confidential","symbol":"La","applink":"leafly://strain/la-confidential"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":74,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tRapid vegetative growth\n\tMay be pinched or topped during vegetative period for improved yields\n\n"}}
