            "text": "Absolutely the best strain i have found for someone with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). My girlfriend, who suffers BPD, is cognitive and sharp while feeling its effects. while smoking otjer strains, she is normally reckless, disorganized and in a state of stupor. this strain brings out her intelligence and is a perfect replacement for Limictol and Vistril, medications prescribed for BPD. This strain has actually given her hope that she can be happy by herself, without my full support. she has been finding herself and enjoying life, rather than dreading it. it.has helped to greatly curb her clinically diagnosed depression. i personally greatly enjoy this strain, as it brings out my happy and productive side, and lets me forget about helping her for a while, because i finally know she can handle herself while high on Citrus. this couldn't be rated higher, and is honestly a totally life saver. not to get too religious, but its the strain that made me believe that marijuana is a medical gift from god. it makes that much of a difference. Thank you to the team that created this absolute godsend.",
