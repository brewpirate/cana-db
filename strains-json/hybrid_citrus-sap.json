You can stay functional if you need to, but if you\u0027re tired and aren\u0027t looking for sleep or don\u0027t smoke often, you should probably steer clear as it can be a little heavy toward the end.

Hood Magic, Kid N\u0027 Cookies, Logic Diesel, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1460746260000)\/","text":"It\u0027s time to start stocking up for 4/20! Did you know you can search strains on Leafly by effects, flavors, benefits, and more? Use the advanced search filters at the top of our strain Explorer to \"customize\" your 4/20 experience! Or, allow us to recommend the following seven strains that were just added to our database. Who knows, maybe they\u0027re just what you\u0027re looking for.\n \n  1. Kid N\u0027 Cookies\n\nA cross of GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) (Forum cut) and Snowman OG, Kid n’ Cookies is a collaboration between Fresno, CA breeders Loud Seeds, and Christopher “Kid” Reid, better known as one half of the famous ‘90s rap duo “Kid n’ Play.” As a potent indica-dominant hybrid testing at over 22% THC, Kid n’ Cookies has a heavy, sedating high that can provide relief from pain, nausea, migraines, and insomnia. The flavor is much like the “cookie” taste of GSC with undertones of pine.\n\n \n  2. Tigermelon\n\nTigermelon is a mysterious strain of unknown origin that has been used by the breeder Bodhi Seeds to create some spectacular hybrids such as Snow Leopard. It is thought to be a three-way cross of Chemdawg, Apollo 11 (Genius cut) and an Uzbekistani indica, and the smell has been described by Bodhi as “sandalwood mango lassi.”\n\n \n  3. Logic Diesel\n\nCreated by GroundSwell Cannabis Boutique in Denver, CO at the request of world-renowned electronic/acid jazz musician DJ Logic, Logic Diesel is a cross between Mystic Kush and NYC Diesel. It has a sweet and sour, skunky diesel odor and flavors ranging from sweet sandalwood to spicy fuel. Logic Diesel will provide an intense, exciting sense of euphoria along with a mildly relaxing body high that is perfect for hitting the dance floor.\n\n \n  4. Haze Berry\n\nA cross between Super Silver Haze and DJ Short’s famous Blueberry, Haze Berry is an 80% sativa hybrid that has become quite popular for its combination of sweet berry, indica-like flavors, and sativa highs. As you might expect from a plant with two extremely potent parents, Haze Berry routinely tests at well over 20% THC, and some cultivars have a significant amount of CBD as well. In addition, it provides higher than average yields and a relatively short flowering time of 9-10 weeks, making this a very attractive strain for sativa enthusiasts. Haze Berry gives the consumer a euphoric, creativity-inducing high that gradually gives way to a profound sensation of relaxation and well-being.\n\n \n  5. Mt. Hood Magic\n\nThought to be exclusive to Portland, Oregon dispensary Five Zero Trees, Mt. Hood Magic is a cross between Northern Lights #5 and Durban Poison. There a few different phenotypes available: two are indica-dominant and more resemble the NL5 portion of its genetics, testing at 17% and 14% THC; and one is sativa-dominant and similar to Durban Poison, testing at 19% THC.\n\n \n  6. Citrus Sap\n\nFrom Crockett Family Farms and DNA Genetics, Citrus Sap is a hybrid cross between GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4) and Tangie. Growers can expect high yields, heavy resin production, and a sweet mandarin orange aroma, as well as a high calyx-to-leaf ratio. Its flowering time averages between 65 to 70 days.\n\n \n  7. Skins Skunk\n\nThis 60% indica-dominant hybrid from Loud Seeds is a result of years of work that started by pollinating an elite clone-only Afgoo found in Sonoma with a male Michigan Skunk. Selected and bred to the f4 generation, Skins Skunk produces generous yields of hashy smelling flowers with THC levels ranging from 17% to 21% and CBD levels up to 2%.\n\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12002442/new-strains-alert-tigermelon-mt-hood-magic-kid-n-cookies-logic-di.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-tigermelon-mt-hood-magic-kid-n-cookies-logic-di"}],"reviewCount":92,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":80.4542042042042},{"name":"Orange","score":49.076576576576571},{"name":"Pungent","score":23.104354354354356},{"name":"Lemon","score":15.975975975975976},{"name":"Lime","score":15.536786786786786}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":100.99099099099098},{"name":"Euphoric","score":91.801801801801787},{"name":"Uplifted","score":90.788288288288271},{"name":"Relaxed","score":83.62987987987988},{"name":"Creative","score":61.775525525525524}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":80.247747747747738},{"name":"Stress","score":70.285285285285283},{"name":"Inflammation","score":48.397147147147145},{"name":"Fatigue","score":43.873873873873869},{"name":"Pain","score":43.400900900900893}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":57.349849849849846},{"name":"PTSD","score":41.475225225225223},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":17.563813813813812},{"name":"Arthritis","score":13.712462462462462},{"name":"PMS","score":13.611111111111111}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":23.003003003003002},{"name":"Anxious","score":15.3003003003003},{"name":"Paranoid","score":13.374624624624625},{"name":"Headache","score":12.124624624624625},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":7.3648648648648649}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrus-sap_100x100_8f29.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/706219/b/citrus-sap__primary_3083.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrus-sap_100x100_73c0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/666480/b/citrus-sap__primary_ce5c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrus-sap_100x100_9428.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/637482/b/citrus-sap__primary_458a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrus-sap_100x100_dc17.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619118/b/citrus-sap__primary_709b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrus-sap_100x100_5016.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/613806/b/citrus-sap__primary_e90e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/citrus-sap_100x100_c9c3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/605944/b/citrus-sap__primary_f31f.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":15,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA","Portland, OR","Seattle, WA","Eugene, OR","San Diego, CA","Everett, WA","West Hollywood, CA","Las Vegas, NV","Medford, OR","Denver, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/citrus-sap","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.40217391304348/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Gorilla Glue #4","subtitle":null,"slug":"gorilla-glue-4","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-glue-4","symbol":"Gg4","applink":"leafly://strain/gorilla-glue-4"},{"name":"Tangie","subtitle":null,"slug":"tangie","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/tangie","symbol":"Tg","applink":"leafly://strain/tangie"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
