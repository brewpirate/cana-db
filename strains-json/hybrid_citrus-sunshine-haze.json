This genetic combination yields three distinct <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/cannabis-genotypes-and-phenotypes-what-makes-a-strain-unique\">phenotypes</a> ranging from 75/25 sativa-dominant to an even 50/50 split. All phenotypes&nbsp;share a magnificent citrus aroma that runs the gamut from lemon and lime candy, orange, and tangerine with a hint of herbaceous spice. With an average THC content of 28%, Citrus Sunshine Haze is not for the unseasoned consumer.

Being a long time smoker from my years in medical and now as a bud tender, I have been able to experience too many kinds of cannabis to name. This super lemony, sweet tangerine like bud has placed itself up there with the best of them. The effects are immediate and the onset rush of energy without the anxiety which was ever so pleasing. Smoking the citrus sunshine haze felt to me like a ray of sunshine as it poke's it's way through the clouds and warms your soul.  But then it was also clear minded and talkative, it gave me focused energy that elevated my mood, I think it's the perfect social bud in my opinion.",
