            "text": "When I first stumbled upon this strain, I thought what the heck is that smell. It wasn't pungent, but it had a very strong pine smell.  It finally hit me the smell as turpentine like. The bud was gold with orange leaves. The buds were dense, and gave a good amount of flower when I used it in a grinder.\n\nI first smoked a joint and before lighting I pulled on the joint to get a taste of the bud. The taste was piney, sweet and savory. The effect went straight to the head at first. I was able to do some programming and solved an issue I had with the code - I got a little creative. The munchies did kick in fiercely. \n\nI vaped this medicine and the effect was greater and the bud tasted a little more salty (earthy) sweetness with the pine flavor being dominant.\n\nOverall this is some decent medicine. My pain diminished and I was functional and creative. I also recommend watching a movie with this bud - I was able to concentrate on the movie better critically watching and evaluating each scene. This bud will also make a little more social as it uplifts you emotionally.",
