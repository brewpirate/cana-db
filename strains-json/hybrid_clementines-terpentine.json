It wasn\u0027t pungent, but it had a very strong pine smell.  It finally hit me the smell as turpentine like. The bud was gold with orange leaves. The buds were dense, and gave a good amount of flower when I used it in a grinder.\n\nI first smoked a joint and before lighting I pulled on the joint to get a taste of the bud. The taste was piney, sweet and savory. The effect went straight to the head at first. I was able to do some programming and solved an issue I had with the code - I got a little creative. The munchies did kick in fiercely. \n\nI vaped this medicine and the effect was greater and the bud tasted a little more salty (earthy) sweetness with the pine flavor being dominant.\n\nOverall this is some decent medicine. My pain diminished and I was functional and creative. I also recommend watching a movie with this bud - I was able to concentrate on the movie better critically watching and evaluating each scene. This bud will also make a little more social as it uplifts you emotionally.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":2,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":50},{"name":"Earthy","score":50},{"name":"Pine","score":50}],"effects":[{"name":"Aroused","score":50},{"name":"Uplifted","score":50},{"name":"Creative","score":50},{"name":"Focused","score":50},{"name":"Happy","score":50}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":50},{"name":"Pain","score":50},{"name":"Stress","score":50}],"conditions":[{"name":"Arthritis","score":50},{"name":"Multiple Sclerosis","score":50},{"name":"PTSD","score":50}],"negatives":[],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/clementine-s-terpentine_100x100_052d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1004802/b/clementine-s-terpentine__primary_406e.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Portland, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/clementines-terpentine","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"24k Gold","subtitle":null,"slug":"24k-gold","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/24k-gold","symbol":"24k","applink":"leafly://strain/24k-gold"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
