There are a lot about being misinformed on how Colorado Chem \"knocks them out\". \nMy advice for you is to do a lot of research on your Primary Strains if you will. The Chem itself is unbelievable. A very heavy high, no matter what it\u0027s crossed with. Get your tolerance up and grab an oz of the \"Chem Dawg\", then, do another oz. after that, you will find yourself non functional. And see that you will have to keep trying in order to hang with \"The Chem\" \nJust picked up myself an oz of Colorado Chem, it\u0027s 10 at night and I\u0027m ready to work 8 hoursü§òüèΩ\n\nMy Favorite Strain!!!!\n\nOne Happy Native!!\n","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3513","title":"The 2014 Denver Cannabis Cup Winning Flowers","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1398115440000)\/","text":"Another 4/20 has come and gone, and with it passes another High Times¬†Cannabis Cup.
