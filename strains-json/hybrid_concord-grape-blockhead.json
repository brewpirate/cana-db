I got a vape pen to try to find relief for my ADHD (clearly knowing nothing about weed whatsoever!) and I will say that this is not the strain for that. \nIt\u0027s a great, subtle grape taste. Nothing overpowering. Great for any kind of anxiety, but if you\u0027re looking for clear focus, this isn\u0027t for you. My mental faculties were definitely impaired. (I played Monopoly and could NOT for the life of me count my money.) \nIt really helped my with my chronic back pain and pain from PCOS, but other than that, it wasn\u0027t what I personally needed it to be. \nHowever, I did enjoy it! If you\u0027re looking for something to help you sleep, this is a great strand. It may leave you a little hazy the following day, but it\u0027s great for a good night\u0027s sleep.
