            "text": "Let me preface this by saying this is the first strain I've smoked, so take that into consideration. I got a vape pen to try to find relief for my ADHD (clearly knowing nothing about weed whatsoever!) and I will say that this is not the strain for that. \nIt's a great, subtle grape taste. Nothing overpowering. Great for any kind of anxiety, but if you're looking for clear focus, this isn't for you. My mental faculties were definitely impaired. (I played Monopoly and could NOT for the life of me count my money.) \nIt really helped my with my chronic back pain and pain from PCOS, but other than that, it wasn't what I personally needed it to be. \nHowever, I did enjoy it! If you're looking for something to help you sleep, this is a great strand. It may leave you a little hazy the following day, but it's great for a good night's sleep. ",
