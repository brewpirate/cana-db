Focused + creative, I just lost an unplanned-hour after a mere-3 water bong hits.. stress and the day's anxieties melted away within minutes..\ud83d\udd06\ud83d\udd06\n\nBuds are bouncy + beautiful -- I uploaded a pic of the \ud83c\udf4ay buds, dense (but no need for grinder!), 4.5\u2728on my first medication. Great strain for newbies, as it's so smooth + easy on the uptake & exhale, and so far a lovely, mellow evening buzz that I would highly recommend to any & all! \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\u270c\ufe0f\ufe0f\ud83c\udf08\ud83e\udd84\ud83d\udd06",
