The nugs are fantastic; covered in deep, deep purples, with orange hairs and crystals shimmering all over it. I had perhaps some of the stickiest nugs I had ever felt before.The smell; that famous cookie smell found throughout GSCs family just smacks you in the face! The taste...

I was very euphoric and giggly. Everything cracked me up. Performing terribly in an old video game I had zero idea how to play was hilarious. No matter how bad I sucked, I never once got frustrated. I just laughed the whole time.\nFair warning, the stuff is very potent!
