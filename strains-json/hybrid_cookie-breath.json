I had perhaps some of the stickiest nugs I had ever felt before.The smell; that famous cookie smell found throughout GSCs family just smacks you in the face! The taste... Definitely earthy, but with a sweet undertone to it, if that makes sense. And the high... Lord! I smoked two bowls of Cookie Breath, then one bowl of Grand Daddy Purple and I was off! I was very euphoric and giggly. Everything cracked me up. Performing terribly in an old video game I had zero idea how to play was hilarious. No matter how bad I sucked, I never once got frustrated. I just laughed the whole time.\nFair warning, the stuff is very potent! So novice smokers should probably stay away. :)",

It vegs well and looks great in flower, but appears to be a low yielder. Not too much of a surprise with these genetics though. 5 stars to smoke, 4.5 stars to grow...if yields dent matter to you, then 5 stars all around!",
