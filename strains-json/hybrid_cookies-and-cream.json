I have a lot of stress/anxiety and I also smoke for my PMDD. It really helps with muscle cramps/soreness. I\u0027ve also had it help a headache. I have high blood pressure, and it lowered my blood pressure down to around 110/60. This strain completely relaxed and de-stressed me, completely. It took away any anger/frustration/irritation I had, and replaced it with a very peaceful, calm and serene feeling. I was able to relax, watch some tv, surf the net via my phone in bed, without couch locking and passing right out. I was still alert, so it didn\u0027t give me an overly stony feeling either. The other times I smoked more, it def helped me go to sleep. I also have pretty bad insomnia. It didn\u0027t just knock me out, but more like, let me slip into a nice relaxing sleep. I always wake up feeling refreshed, and rejuvenated after smoking this strain. I also found that it made me feel somewhat... How to put this, erotically charged? Subtly though. It did not give me the munchies either.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"},{"id":1638833,"username":"Blotterfall","text":"Looks nice, smells better, and tastes great!
