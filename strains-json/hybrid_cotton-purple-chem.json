Wow. Imbibed a bowl of this and I\u0027m flying high. I have a high tolerance (smoke several bowls per day), but just a bowl of this stuff and I\u0027m feeling great. \u0027Bout to hid the hay, and this seems like a good strain for nighttime so far—very relaxed body-wise and my mind isn\u0027t racing like with most sativas.\n\nThe nose—top notch. Here\u0027s what the flower smells like: buttered popcorn JellyBelly. It tastes just as good.\n\nMakes your entire body tingle... It\u0027s great. It\u0027s definteily good on the body, but my mind is mostly clear. I can enjoy a TV show. I can write this review. I can have a conversation. So you can do all those things and still be really bonkers high on this strain. It\u0027s that type of strain.\n\nThis is Green Life\u0027s most popular strain, according to their dispensary page, and the guy I spoke to on the phone suggested it. I totally see why. From the physicalities to the effects, this bud is really freaking dank, straight up.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"},{"id":1562566,"username":"DrippingAnus","text":"I smoked this one of my first times smoking alone and it was one of the best strains I’ve ever smoked.

The celebration was sponsored by Leafly and showcased some of the region’s best cannabis flower, concentrates, edibles, topicals, glass artists, and accessories. Even a last-minute venue change couldn’t stop the stream of cannabis lovers from overflowing the state fair-themed event that came complete with infused cotton candy, a mechanical joint to ride, magicians, performers, artists, and more. Honestly, the only thing missing was a medicated corn dog to combat my munchies.\nAs expected, the dab bar was the hive that everyone was buzzing around, with a variety of solvent and solventless concentrates to sample from some of the best extract artists in the area. The highlight had to be local artist Scott Deppe’s crystal skull piece that sat at the X-Tracted bar and captured every passer-by with its intricate design and whopping 6-figure price tag. Those who weren’t concentrated around the dab rigs were busy sampling edibles, entering raffles, and relaxing with a massage at one the topical company booths.\n\nA judge’s pass to the event allowed visitors to join the action by sampling each of the strains entered into the People\u0027s Choice category of the Cup. For $99, the judge’s pass gave ticket-holders a half gram sample of all 10 anonymous strains and the opportunity to vote for their favorite. The mystery strains all had amazing flavors, ranging from sweet and tropical to earthy and piney, which made it all the more difficult to choose a favorite.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the
