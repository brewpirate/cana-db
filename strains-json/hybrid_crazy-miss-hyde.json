If you had a jarring, eventful transition into the new year, these hybrids are just what you\u0027ll need to recover balanced equilibrium. Or, for those who had a relaxing night in, one of these new varieties should be all you need to stay on track for a blissful, stress-free 2015 launch.\nWe know many of you are no stranger to these new strains, so be sure to leave a review sharing your thoughts if you\u0027ve had a chance to try one already! \n   1. White Nightmare\nCharacteristics of White Nightmare:\n\nBlue Dream’s soaring sativa effects and fruity flavors collide with White Moonshine’s resinous coat of milky trichomes to produce White Nightmare. The sativa-dominant hybrid brings a forceful, sweet aroma of berries and Haze. The flavor stays true to its Blue Dream genetics but with an earthy, hash-like aftertaste. White Nightmare generates a stimulating stream of euphoria and bliss that elevates the mood and brings with it a comfortable, relaxing body high.\n\n   2. Monkey Paw\nCharacteristics of Monkey Paw:\n\nMonkey Paw takes its name from its fingerling buds that resemble the curled paws of primates. It is a fabled old school strain whose roots sprouted in Michigan and has built a solid reputation for itself across the Midwest. This hybrid is a compelling mixture of Acapulco Gold and Colombian Gold sativas that are balanced by Afghani’s indica influence to produce a pungent combination of sweet and fruity flavors. Its aroma is reminiscent of the thick musk of Skunk varieties with sharp notes of zesty citrus that cut the senses. The aftertaste of fresh fruits, like grape and blueberry, serves as precursor to the relaxing effects that calm body pains and stimulate the stomach. \n\n   3. Lost Coast OG\nCharacteristics of Lost Coast OG:\n\nLost Coast OG is a 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid that marries Chemdawg 4 genetics with those of two age-old heirloom strains, Pakistani Kush and Lemon Thai. Flavors of sour citrus and earthy musk burst through on the exhale in show of its signature OG terpene profile. This California native induces a soaring cerebral buzzing sensation that brings new vitality to mood, creativity, and conversation. The potently euphoric effects can sometimes skid into anxiety with large doses, so novices should approach this OG with some degree of caution. \n\n   4. Crazy Miss Hyde\nCharacteristics of Crazy Miss Hyde:\n\nCrazy Miss Hyde is a surprisingly balanced hybrid given her name. She is a lively combination of the uplifting, sativa-dominant Belladona and the powerhouse indica Northern Lights. The buds deliver a potent mixture of earthy flavors like menthol and chocolate with a sweet vanilla influence. The effects tend to be focused in the head, with thought provoking stimulation and creativity that can border on anxiety when over-consumed. With the right dosing, the indica influence levels out the effects of Crazy Miss Hyde and induces a relaxing sense of euphoria.\n\n   5. Blueberry Yum Yum\nCharacteristics of Blueberry Yum Yum:\n\nBlueberry Yum Yum is a hybrid strain whose popularity was ushered in by rap artist Ludacris and his song centered on the strain. While certainly the progeny of the famed Blueberry indica, its other parent is suspected to have been a Durban Poison sativa. Because of its parents’ polarity, Blueberry Yum Yum can express a wide spectrum of effects, but consumers typically report uplifting, happy effects perfect for any time of the day. Though dominated by an unmistakable blueberry aroma, accents of earthy mint and pine can also be detected on the palate. ","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12002449/new-strains-alert-white-nightmare-monkey-paw-lost-coast-og-crazy.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-white-nightmare-monkey-paw-lost-coast-og-crazy"}],"reviewCount":21,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":20.238095238095234},{"name":"Vanilla","score":17.857142857142854},{"name":"Butter","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Pine","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Earthy","score":4.7619047619047619}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":41.666666666666657},{"name":"Happy","score":40.476190476190467},{"name":"Creative","score":38.095238095238088},{"name":"Euphoric","score":26.19047619047619},{"name":"Energetic","score":23.809523809523807}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":4.7619047619047619},{"name":"Depression","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Inflammation","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Nausea","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":2.3809523809523809}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":5.9523809523809517},{"name":"Arthritis","score":4.7619047619047619},{"name":"Anxiety","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Asthma","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":1.1904761904761905}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.1904761904761905},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.1904761904761905}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_e942.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619503/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_6c60.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_600c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/589554/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_9f2a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_3afa.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/568751/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_e2a6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_db31.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/521290/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_ad06.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_8562.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/521194/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_9968.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_cd26.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/507735/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_cd9a.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":18,"popularCities":["Bozeman, MT","Seattle, WA","Washington, DC"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/crazy-miss-hyde","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.85714285714286/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Belladonna","subtitle":null,"slug":"belladonna","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/belladonna","symbol":"Bel","applink":"leafly://strain/belladonna"},{"name":"Northern Lights","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights","symbol":"Nl","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

If you had a jarring, eventful transition into the new year, these hybrids are just what you\u0027ll need to recover balanced equilibrium. Or, for those who had a relaxing night in, one of these new varieties should be all you need to stay on track for a blissful, stress-free 2015 launch.\nWe know many of you are no stranger to these new strains, so be sure to leave a review sharing your thoughts if you\u0027ve had a chance to try one already! \n   1. White Nightmare\nCharacteristics of White Nightmare:\n\nBlue Dream’s soaring sativa effects and fruity flavors collide with White Moonshine’s resinous coat of milky trichomes to produce White Nightmare. The sativa-dominant hybrid brings a forceful, sweet aroma of berries and Haze. The flavor stays true to its Blue Dream genetics but with an earthy, hash-like aftertaste. White Nightmare generates a stimulating stream of euphoria and bliss that elevates the mood and brings with it a comfortable, relaxing body high.\n\n   2. Monkey Paw\nCharacteristics of Monkey Paw:\n\nMonkey Paw takes its name from its fingerling buds that resemble the curled paws of primates. It is a fabled old school strain whose roots sprouted in Michigan and has built a solid reputation for itself across the Midwest. This hybrid is a compelling mixture of Acapulco Gold and Colombian Gold sativas that are balanced by Afghani’s indica influence to produce a pungent combination of sweet and fruity flavors. Its aroma is reminiscent of the thick musk of Skunk varieties with sharp notes of zesty citrus that cut the senses. The aftertaste of fresh fruits, like grape and blueberry, serves as precursor to the relaxing effects that calm body pains and stimulate the stomach. \n\n   3. Lost Coast OG\nCharacteristics of Lost Coast OG:\n\nLost Coast OG is a 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid that marries Chemdawg 4 genetics with those of two age-old heirloom strains, Pakistani Kush and Lemon Thai. Flavors of sour citrus and earthy musk burst through on the exhale in show of its signature OG terpene profile. This California native induces a soaring cerebral buzzing sensation that brings new vitality to mood, creativity, and conversation. The potently euphoric effects can sometimes skid into anxiety with large doses, so novices should approach this OG with some degree of caution. \n\n   4. Crazy Miss Hyde\nCharacteristics of Crazy Miss Hyde:\n\nCrazy Miss Hyde is a surprisingly balanced hybrid given her name. She is a lively combination of the uplifting, sativa-dominant Belladona and the powerhouse indica Northern Lights. The buds deliver a potent mixture of earthy flavors like menthol and chocolate with a sweet vanilla influence. The effects tend to be focused in the head, with thought provoking stimulation and creativity that can border on anxiety when over-consumed. With the right dosing, the indica influence levels out the effects of Crazy Miss Hyde and induces a relaxing sense of euphoria.\n\n   5. Blueberry Yum Yum\nCharacteristics of Blueberry Yum Yum:\n\nBlueberry Yum Yum is a hybrid strain whose popularity was ushered in by rap artist Ludacris and his song centered on the strain. While certainly the progeny of the famed Blueberry indica, its other parent is suspected to have been a Durban Poison sativa. Because of its parents’ polarity, Blueberry Yum Yum can express a wide spectrum of effects, but consumers typically report uplifting, happy effects perfect for any time of the day. Though dominated by an unmistakable blueberry aroma, accents of earthy mint and pine can also be detected on the palate. ","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12002449/new-strains-alert-white-nightmare-monkey-paw-lost-coast-og-crazy.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-white-nightmare-monkey-paw-lost-coast-og-crazy"}],"reviewCount":21,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":20.238095238095234},{"name":"Vanilla","score":17.857142857142854},{"name":"Butter","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Pine","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Earthy","score":4.7619047619047619}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":41.666666666666657},{"name":"Happy","score":40.476190476190467},{"name":"Creative","score":38.095238095238088},{"name":"Euphoric","score":26.19047619047619},{"name":"Energetic","score":23.809523809523807}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":4.7619047619047619},{"name":"Depression","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Inflammation","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Nausea","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":2.3809523809523809}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":5.9523809523809517},{"name":"Arthritis","score":4.7619047619047619},{"name":"Anxiety","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Asthma","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":1.1904761904761905}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.1904761904761905},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.1904761904761905}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_e942.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619503/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_6c60.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_600c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/589554/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_9f2a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_3afa.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/568751/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_e2a6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_db31.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/521290/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_ad06.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_8562.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/521194/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_9968.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_cd26.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/507735/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_cd9a.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":18,"popularCities":["Bozeman, MT","Seattle, WA","Washington, DC"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/crazy-miss-hyde","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.85714285714286/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Belladonna","subtitle":null,"slug":"belladonna","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/belladonna","symbol":"Bel","applink":"leafly://strain/belladonna"},{"name":"Northern Lights","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights","symbol":"Nl","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Crazy Miss Hyde\nCharacteristics of Crazy Miss Hyde:\n\nCrazy Miss Hyde is a surprisingly balanced hybrid given her name. She is a lively combination of the uplifting, sativa-dominant Belladona and the powerhouse indica Northern Lights. The buds deliver a potent mixture of earthy flavors like menthol and chocolate with a sweet vanilla influence. The effects tend to be focused in the head, with thought provoking stimulation and creativity that can border on anxiety when over-consumed. With the right dosing, the indica influence levels out the effects of Crazy Miss Hyde and induces a relaxing sense of euphoria.\n\n   5. Blueberry Yum Yum\nCharacteristics of Blueberry Yum Yum:\n\nBlueberry Yum Yum is a hybrid strain whose popularity was ushered in by rap artist Ludacris and his song centered on the strain. While certainly the progeny of the famed Blueberry indica, its other parent is suspected to have been a Durban Poison sativa. Because of its parents’ polarity, Blueberry Yum Yum can express a wide spectrum of effects, but consumers typically report uplifting, happy effects perfect for any time of the day. Though dominated by an unmistakable blueberry aroma, accents of earthy mint and pine can also be detected on the palate. ","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12002449/new-strains-alert-white-nightmare-monkey-paw-lost-coast-og-crazy.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-white-nightmare-monkey-paw-lost-coast-og-crazy"}],"reviewCount":21,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":20.238095238095234},{"name":"Vanilla","score":17.857142857142854},{"name":"Butter","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Pine","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Earthy","score":4.7619047619047619}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":41.666666666666657},{"name":"Happy","score":40.476190476190467},{"name":"Creative","score":38.095238095238088},{"name":"Euphoric","score":26.19047619047619},{"name":"Energetic","score":23.809523809523807}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":4.7619047619047619},{"name":"Depression","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Inflammation","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Nausea","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":2.3809523809523809}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":5.9523809523809517},{"name":"Arthritis","score":4.7619047619047619},{"name":"Anxiety","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Asthma","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":1.1904761904761905}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.1904761904761905},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.1904761904761905}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_e942.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619503/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_6c60.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_600c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/589554/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_9f2a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_3afa.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/568751/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_e2a6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_db31.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/521290/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_ad06.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_8562.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/521194/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_9968.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/crazy-miss-hyde_100x100_cd26.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/507735/b/crazy-miss-hyde__primary_cd9a.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":18,"popularCities":["Bozeman, MT","Seattle, WA","Washington, DC"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/crazy-miss-hyde","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.85714285714286/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Belladonna","subtitle":null,"slug":"belladonna","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/belladonna","symbol":"Bel","applink":"leafly://strain/belladonna"},{"name":"Northern Lights","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights","symbol":"Nl","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
