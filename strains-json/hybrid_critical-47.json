It is like the first time you become medicated. I noticed I had a lot of anxiety and a lot of stress going to a party so I brought my cannabis and medicated before going in and had a good time, not one of the best but a great time. If you have stress anxiety, mood disorders or even a severe amount of pain and nerve damage I highly suggest this. It is a wondrous strain if you\u0027re looking for a powerful CBD strain, but still holding a lot of the THC to become medicated, but not to much.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1307908,"username":"trollette","text":"its not a bad flavor but it is a bit like leafy home grown like the buzz as far as a down and relaxed but would rather it be cleaned yup a bit more,,it would be nicely suited at 10 a g if so.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3391","title":"New Strains Alert: Santa Maria, White Elephant, Critical Sensi Star, Critical 47, and Iced Widow","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1414785600000)\/","text":"Happy Halloween, Leafly friends!
