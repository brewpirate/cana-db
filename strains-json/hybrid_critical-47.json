I noticed I had a lot of anxiety and a lot of stress going to a party so I brought my cannabis and medicated before going in and had a good time, not one of the best but a great time. If you have stress anxiety, mood disorders or even a severe amount of pain and nerve damage I highly suggest this. It is a wondrous strain if you're looking for a powerful CBD strain, but still holding a lot of the THC to become medicated, but not to much.",
