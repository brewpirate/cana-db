You feel the haze roll in over your eyes and your and you get a thousand thoughts on your mind and become extremly relaxed. Smoking it makes you feel like all your problems go away.  It\u0027s a super effective strain if you want to get the munchies! You just never feel full, you just keep on eating and eating until you eventually look like a pregnant women!\n\nDownside is that you sort of forget what you are talking about while you are talking about it so you need the person that you are talking with to remind you what you are talking about.\n\nIt\u0027s not a great strain if you want to be social because this makes you really introverted and you just want to sit and think for yourself about things and focus on what is going on in your own head. But in smaller amounts it works great, just makes you happier and think a littlebit more and random, so the right amount is the key!\n\nWithout this strain i would probably have killed myself.\n\nThe strain has genetics of some of the most powerful indicas and a very respected sativa.\n5/5 this strain defines a cough locker.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"},{"id":1627936,"username":"vitormolica","text":"It is a Haze: Taste and vibe.
