Its aroma falls on the border between sweet and sour, blending\u0026nbsp;pine, lemon, and cheese flavors.\n","aka":"NorCal Crypt","rating":4.45,"highlightedReviews":[{"id":1383119,"username":"cds2224","text":"Was very close to giving this one a 5th star! \n\nAesthetics: The Crypt I picked up has very nice bud structure... not too dense but also not too loose and fluffy--right in between. It almost looks like it has a slight white fuzz covering it at first glance. Closer examination shows that it\u0027s just the tightly packed trichomes.\n\nSmell: This bud has an amazing nose. Aside from the name, the smell is what attracted me to this bud. I would say that the first thing you notice is a sweet smell, which is immediately followed by a cheese type aroma. IMO, very nice!\n\nSmoke: Smokes very nice. As long as your bud is not too dry, you won\u0027t have to worry about any type of harshness. My Crypt has consistently held its perfect grey/white ash when burnt.\n\nTaste: Taste so far hasn\u0027t been anything \"Amaazzzinngg\", but it definitely is better than a lot of other strains out there. You may get a slightly lemony sweet taste on the inhale, which is followed by a cheesy, earthy taste on the exhale.\n\nEffects: The few bowls of this I\u0027ve had have been pretty consistent in terms of the high. I would have to say that an Indica dominant Hybrid is such an accurate title for this strain. it had me feeling relaxed, tired, but not too tired, and fairly clear headed compared to some other hybrids out there. \n\nVerdict: Overall, I really do like this strain. Out of the 3 strains I\u0027m currently smoking on--Crypt, Great White Shark, and Cypress OG, this has been my go-to. Like I said... almost a five. Only things that could make it better would be a slightly more flavorful smoke, and more of a \"sleepy\" inducing effect.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1543717,"username":"nster1","text":"i really enjoy this weed for indoors if your not allowed to snoke inside its got the buzz and kick of my fav purplu kush or any kush great dominate for sure love my idicas not a fan of hybirds but this almost tast like sour dieseil kush shatter when smoke in a join with i love and as for medication its amazing in this criteria \nrelaxed first.            90%\ndepression secound 70%\nhappy.                       50%\n...
