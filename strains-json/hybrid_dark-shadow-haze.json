But the taste and small are dank, hints of that classic purple flavor with earthy limes and citrus tones!! I am excited to try the dark ghost train which is Grape Ape and Ghost train... no still keeping the wreck aspect! You can't go wrong here!! Melts physical pain yet stimulates focus for me. Mmm.. mmmmm...Delicious!",
