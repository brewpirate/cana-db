The effects I felt were an elevated mood, mild-to-strong body tingles and pain replacement (where any mild ache is replaced by a more enjoyable tingling sensation), and a classic, spacey head high. When conversing with others there was a tendency during the peak of the high to train wreck a story or forget the point being made. The high I got, from two big hits using a Mobius Ion Matrix Bubbler, lasted around two hours. My experience level is 16+ years of using MJ.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sPaGuIbcIjKwcF8O7kQXXoAFJ6s=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fkfmswExdS0yqeEmdLkUQ_nerd-green.png"},{"id":1640616,"username":"theORherb","text":"I told my budtender that I wanted \"a positive cerebral-high\". She suggested Deadhead right away. I really like this strain! It delivers a very happy, yet mellow head-high! It smells kinda dank \u0026 earthy, but in a good way. The smoke is smooth. An early morning moring bowl of Deadhead with a strong cup of coffee is a great way to start the day!
