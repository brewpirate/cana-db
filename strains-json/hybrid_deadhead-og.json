            "text": "This is a fun strain to consume in casual situations with friends, but in my experience would prefer not to use when work is needed to be done or focus is required. The effects I felt were an elevated mood, mild-to-strong body tingles and pain replacement (where any mild ache is replaced by a more enjoyable tingling sensation), and a classic, spacey head high. When conversing with others there was a tendency during the peak of the high to train wreck a story or forget the point being made. The high I got, from two big hits using a Mobius Ion Matrix Bubbler, lasted around two hours. My experience level is 16+ years of using MJ.",

It smells kinda dank & earthy, but in a good way. The smoke is smooth. An early morning moring bowl of Deadhead with a strong cup of coffee is a great way to start the day! I'll get it again for sure!",
