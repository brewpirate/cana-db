While many strains are great for exploring the outdoors, they are usually very high-energy Sativas. Well, this one is more  for getting a chair or hammock and just hanging out in a rather meditative at-one-with-nature sort of feeling. The sun was bright, the sky was blue and the weed was extremely pungent and cheesy. Deep Cheese is excellent for getting in touch with your surroundings.",
