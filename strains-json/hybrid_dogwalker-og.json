            "text": "April is a great month. The hours of light are stretching longer into the evening, the trees start to bud, and that sweet, sweet tax return arrives in the mail, which basically feels like free money even though it\u2019s definitely not. Maybe you\u2019ll prematurely stuff your peacoat far into the depths of your closet and find yourself going for walks, taking deep inhalations of that springy, earthy smell, and turning to your friends and yelling, \u201cThis is life! This is living!\u201d Hey, when spring grabs hold, there\u2019s not much you can do to stop it.\n\nThis month\u2019s new-to-Netflix lineup is further proof that April rocks and that T.S. Eliot was very incorrect when he said, \u201cApril is the cruelest month.\u201d Poor guy probably always owed to the IRS at the end of the year. Here are some of the best new things for your eyeballs.\n\u00a0\nFor the Lover of Both Dogs and Mockumentaries\n\nWatch: Best in Show\nWho are the types of people who breed dogs for kennel club shows? This mockumentary by writer and director Christopher Guest shows you the seedy and hilarious underbelly of the high-brow world of dog breeding and showing. Guest, who is known for popularizing the \u201cmockumentary\u201d style of shooting, relies largely on improvisation for Best in Show, as well as his other popular mockumentary films, including A Mighty Wind, This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman. If you love The Office or Parks and Rec, you will absolutely love this movie, as Guest\u2019s style arguably laid the foundation for the success of the mockumentary sitcom. It\u2019s got a Portlandia-style sense of self-aware humor to it, plus it has people who look like their dogs.\nAvailable: April 1st\nStrain Pairing: Dogwalker OG\nMunchies: In the spirit of canines, why not whip up a batch of Puppy Chow?\n\u00a0\nFor Fans of Post-Bunker Humor\n\nWatch: Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Season 2\nThe brains behind 30 Rock, Tina Fey and Robert Carlock, bring us season two of their wacky Netflix original Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt on April 15. The jokes are just as fast and funny in this sitcom starring Ellie Kemper as a cult survivor who strikes out on her own to start a life in New York City after spending years underground in a bunker. While in season one we see Kimmy navigate some of the basics of life \u2013 getting a job, dating, and finding a roommate \u2013 we can expect that no matter what new life troubles are thrown her way in season two, she\u2019ll face them with the same combination of na\u00efvet\u00e9, grit and determination that makes her such a strange yet lovable character.\nAvailable: April 15th\nStrain Pairing: NYC Diesel\nMunchies: Since Kimmy still has the palate of a child, load up on plenty of chocolate and candy.\n\u00a0\nFor Those of You Yearning for Zihuatanejo\n\nWatch: The Shawshank Redemption\nThe Shawshank Redemption was selected by the Library of Congress in 2015 to be preserved in the National Film Registry due to its cultural and aesthetic significance. In short: this is a really good movie. Based on a novella by Stephen King, the movie takes place in his home state of Maine and tells the story of Andy Dufresne, who is sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife and child. The movie takes us inside the walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary to learn about the alliances, betrayal and oppression that inmates face in a high-security facility. If you\u2019re a fan of Orange Is the New Black but have never sat down to watch Shawshank, you\u2019re in for a treat.\nAvailable: April 1st\nStrain Pairing: Star Killer\nMunchies: To celebrate your freedom, why not go for the least prison-type food possible: sushi.\n\u00a0\nFor Folks Who Want to Learn About Law as Salaciously as Possible\n\nWatch: How to Get Away with Murder Season 2\nThis TV drama series on ABC centers around law school professor Annalise Keating (Viola Davis), who teaches a class on criminal defense that she refers to as \u201cHow to Get Away with Murder 101.\u201d The second season of this murder- and betrayal-filled show has earned Viola Davis the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance in a Drama Series and secured executive producer Shonda Rhimes as an unstoppable creator of salacious and ensnaring dramas (she\u2019s also behind Grey\u2019s Anatomy and Scandal). Of course, this is nothing like the boring Torts classes you heard so much about from your friends slogging through law school.\nAvailable: April 16th\nStrain Pairing: Outlaw\nMunchies: Rhimes\u2019 one controversial opinion might be that she hates thin crust pizza. Order in a deep dish in her honor.\n\u00a0\nFor Those of You Who Have Never Caught a Glimpse of Dirk's \"Diggler\"\n\nWatch: Boogie Nights\nFrom a nightclub dishwasher to a wealthy porn star, Boogie Nights tracks the rise of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlburg), a baby-faced high school dropout who takes on the porn star persona of Dirk Diggler after a director (Burt Reynolds) takes him under his wing based on his good looks and natural charm. The film, set in southern California\u2019s San Fernando Valley, helped director Paul Thomas Anderson get on the map during his twenties. (He then went on to create well-regarded classics including Magnolia, There Will Be Blood and The Master.) Watching young Eddie succumb to the addiction to money, power and sex feels like witnessing a slow-motion trainwreck in a similar vein as The Wolf of Wall Street. For many reasons, you can\u2019t look away.\nAvailable: April 1st\nStrain Pairing: Money Maker\nMunchies: It\u2019s set in Los Angeles \u2013 what better excuse do you need for chips and guac?\n\nImage Sources: IMDb",

            "text": "To make a truly informed cannabis-buying decision, you have to smell the product. And I don\u2019t mean taking a dainty whiff. You\u2019ve got get in there and really inhale, because smelling it \u2014 really focusing on the fragrance \u2014 may just be the best way to choose your cannabis.\n\u201cDepending on what the scent is, it can make or break a strain for people,\u201d said Tyson Dieter, a manager at the Southwest Portland outlet of Nectar, an Oregon cannabis retailer.\nI\u2019m a home perfumer trained by a world-class nose. Years ago I trained at home using natural perfumer Mandy Aftel\u2019s workbooks, and later I studied with her at her studio in Berkeley, Calif. For me scent is the ultimate in pleasure experiences. On a recent Tuesday morning, I stopped in at Nectar to talk scent and learn about the role it plays in the burgeoning cannabis industry.\nWhat Do Cannabis and Perfumes Have in Common?\nIt turns out perfume and pot have a lot in common.\nBoth products come with outlandish, sometimes arbitrary titles. Burberry Weekend, meet Blackberry Kush. Practically no one buys the product without smelling it first. (Where it\u2019s allowed, that is. In Washington state, pre-purchase smelling for recreational cannabis is against the law.) We don\u2019t talk about them using the same language, although that\u2019s changing as consumers learn more about scent\u2019s connection to the cannabis experience.\n\nAs I stepped through Nectar\u2019s front door, the first thing I noticed was the air, which smelled lightly of sweet herb. The employees \u2014 perhaps the happiest service professionals I\u2019ve ever encountered \u2014 were all eager to talk to me about their favorite-smelling strains.\nCommercial perfumes are composed of top notes, middle notes (also called heart notes) and base notes, so named based on their relative evaporation rates. A perfume with a top note of essential oil of bergamot (citrus) might be paired with a middle note of lavender oil and a base note of thick, resiny oakmoss. Together they make up the full scent experience of the perfume.\nIn the cannabis world, the language hasn\u2019t yet evolved to describe the plant\u2019s fragrance notes with such specificity. But budtenders and growers are expanding their vocabulary to describe the scent experience. So you may see two main, often contrasting odors: sweet and fruity paired with earthy, like in an Afgooey.\nAt Nectar the jars open dozens of times a day for olfactory sampling. Some strains are more fragrant than others. A Blackberry Kush may not remind anyone of blackberries, but it does have a subtle sweetness to balance the hashy, diesel-fume center it\u2019s known for. GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), another potent strain, smells oily and pungent in the middle and slightly sweet on top.\nAll cannabis strains carry their own scent signature, a fact that often surprises cannabis consumers who come to a shop for the first time.\n\n\u201cFirst-timers generally know about THC content and little else,\u201d Dieter said. \u201cBut then they usually stand there smelling all day to find a perfect match.\u201d\nSome strains share some of their scent identity with the world of aromatherapy. An activating hybrid sativa like Orange Crush has much in common with a bitter orange essential oil \u2014 one often used by aromatherapists for energizing. In the same vein, the citrus-scented J1, a sativa hybrid, smells like a traditional foug\u00e8re-style perfume, opening with a citrus note and moving into an herby heart.\nBecause scent is deeply personal, no one really agrees on which strains smell best. A savory, cheesy strain like OG99 might send some running for the hills, but for consumers who like to \u201csmoke savory,\u201d the associated mellow vibe is well worth it.\nOther consumers prefer the so-called \u201cauthentic-smelling\u201d pot strains. For them, something like The Perps, which gives off the odor of a grape Jolly Rancher, might feel like spraying your face with Britney Spears\u2019 Curious.\nWhy Consumption Methods Matter When It Comes to Scent Preservation\nWhen it comes to harnessing the scent of cannabis, consumption methods matter.\n\nA cannabis flower\u2019s scent comes directly from its terpenes, volatile aromatic organic compounds found in the oils of all flowers. Terpenes in the cannabis flower evolved to attract pollinators or repel enemies. More than 100 possible terpenes are thought to exist in various strains of the cannabis flower.\nThe unique combination of terpenes in a particular strain produces its aromatic properties and, some believe, is thought to influence the body\u2019s high. To heighten the experience of the terpenes, therefore, consumers should reach for consumption methods involving less combustion. The higher the burn temperature, the more likely the most volatile and aromatic terpenes will combust before being consumed.\nIn other words, to get the full scent experience, vape it, don\u2019t smoke it.\n\u201cWhen you have a vaping machine, it can hinder the effect of the flavor,\u201d said Myles Hyde, a budtender at Nectar who specializes in medicinal use. For flower, Hyde suggested using a vaporizer in at least the $250 range. \u201cWith a lower-quality machine, you may end up smelling some of the machine itself.\u201d\n\nThose who do want to smoke it would be advised to do it indoors, according to Hyde, where the scent lingers, affecting the high.\nOther methods, like using hash oil, produces a concentrated scent experience so aromatic it feels like smelling an aged perfume. Dieter pulled a Dogwalker resin with a smell reminiscent of jasmine concentrate: dirty, floral, even slightly fecal. In this way, fragrance obsessives are much like cheese hounds or any other aficionados who move with passion into a sensual pursuit \u2014 as they explore their olfactory world, they become more and more enamored with scents that might repel the layperson.\nEmphasizing Fragrance as Part of the Purchasing Decision\nThe importance of scent is beginning to take on a bigger role in the purchasing decision at some of Portland\u2019s leading retail shops. During a recent visit to Oregon\u2019s Finest, a store tucked into the city\u2019s swanky Pearl District, manager Selena Toomey pulled flower-filled apothecary jars off a shelf for me.\n\u201cStrains sell themselves based on their scent,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cIt makes a huge difference in the experience.\u201d\n\nPerfumers are taught to smell coffee beans between samples in order to cleanse their palates. Oregon\u2019s Finest has adapted the practice for the cannabis connoisseur. Toomey invited me to sniff single-origin beans (this is Portland, after all) while passing between strain jars.\nToomey often suggests patients spend up to 10 minutes working the flower in their hands before smoking or vaping it. Doing so, she said, allows you to smell more of the terpenes and enhance the way it tastes when consumed.\n\u201cThe terpenoids and flavonoids play a huge part in opening up your receptors to all of the effects of the cannabis,\u201d Toomey explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like steaming in a hot shower before you moisturize.\u201d\nScent scientists often talk about the cognitive barriers to talking about our often ignored fifth sense \u2014 that we don\u2019t really practice the language needed to really discuss scent.\n\nWhen Toomey talks about scent to her customers, she sometimes avoids scent talk and focuses on taste, which offers a vocabulary more familiar to most consumers. She\u2019ll speak of a strain like Dutch Treat as being like \u201cmint chocolate chip ice cream.\u201d\nToomey has been at Oregon\u2019s Finest since its 2014 opening. She\u2019s seen her customer base grow from curiosity to connoisseurship, even as the shop retains its focus on pot\u2019s medicinal effects.\nShe sells individual terpenes as an additive to other marijuana products for medicinal users. Once you have enough experience to identify specific terpenes by smell alone, you can anticipate the associated high, she said.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m in a dispensary, I can tell by the aroma if a strain will work with my body,\u201d Toomey added. \u201cThe nose knows.\u201d\nEmily Grosvenor is a writer and perfumer based in Oregon.
