It seems like it would be a heavily sedating medication yet my experience with this strain is that is isn\u0027t very strong at all. ChemDawg or Sour Diesel will bring you all the effects of Dopium and many more. I don\u0027t particularly care for this strain, but that being said it is great for beginners! It tastes piney and earthy but not too pungent. Like a milder version of it\u0027s parents. It was from Silver Sage Wellness and maybe it was just too dry and I need to give it another try. Will update this if I come across some fresh Dopium. a-Pinene: 0.02 mg/g, Limonene: 0.11 mg/g.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/2/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1348913,"username":"hawkski86","text":"this is strange due to the fact that I have th his strain in wax form and it\u0027s advertised as INDICA.
