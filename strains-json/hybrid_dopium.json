It seems like it would be a heavily sedating medication yet my experience with this strain is that is isn't very strong at all. ChemDawg or Sour Diesel will bring you all the effects of Dopium and many more. I don't particularly care for this strain, but that being said it is great for beginners! It tastes piney and earthy but not too pungent. Like a milder version of it's parents. It was from Silver Sage Wellness and maybe it was just too dry and I need to give it another try. Will update this if I come across some fresh Dopium. a-Pinene: 0.02 mg/g, Limonene: 0.11 mg/g.",
