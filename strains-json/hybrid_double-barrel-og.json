For the ones you\u0027ve tried, you should leave a review reminiscing over all the good times with that strain. If you haven\u0027t had the chance to test any of these varieties out, don\u0027t fret — the links below will tell you whether or not that strain is being offered at a shop near you.\n \n 1. Strawberry Fields \n\nStrawberry Fields by Sagarmatha Seeds is an indica-dominant hybrid strain that takes the flavorful Strawberry Cough and crosses it with an undisclosed indica parent. This strain is destined for consumers who love that strawberry aroma, but would prefer something more tranquilizing than the Strawberry Cough sativa. Its heavier effects also make Strawberry Fields a better choice for patients treating pain, insomnia, and appetite loss.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Strawberry Fields\n \n 2. Blurple\n\nBlurple, also known as Blue Dream Purple, is a balanced hybrid cross between Blue Dream and Mendocino Purps. Its effects position themselves cerebrally at first, with gentle body relaxation that keeps you feeling light and free of tension. Drawing from both sides of the family, Blurple carries a sweet, dessert-like berry and grape aroma that comes to life on the inhale. This strain earns its name as bluish purple hues swirl throughout Blurple’s green buds.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Blurple\n \n 3. Kona Gold\n\nKona Gold is a sativa strain that has traveled far from its native origin, the volcanic soils of Hawaii’s Big Island. Soaring cerebral-focused euphoria captures the mind while leaving the body light and functional, making this sativa a perfect pair with or replacement for your morning cup of coffee. A tropical medley of pineapple and citrus flavors are cut by a sharp sour aroma that could almost be compared to diesel fuel. The authentic Kona Gold is unique to its mineral-rich homeland, but its replications overseas still have much to offer sativa enthusiasts.\n\nKona Gold is currently available at QPC in Everett, WA\n \n 4. Skunk 47\n\nSkunk 47, offspring of Skunk #1 and AK-47, is a sour-smelling hybrid strain that leans far to the indica side of the family. Bred by World of Seeds Bank, Skunk 47’s parents were selected for pungent aromas and fast flowering cycles. Additionally, Skunk 47 plants have a high resistance to mold and pests. Its indica tendencies come out strong in this strain’s effects, delivering a crushing heaviness perfect for stubborn pain or sleepless nights.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Skunk 47\n \n 5. Blackberry Trainwreck\n\nBlackberry Trainwreck, or Blackberry Wreck, is a hybrid strain parented by two notable varieties, Blackberry Kush and Trainwreck. Led by indica genetics, Blackberry Trainwreck typically grows into chunky, dense conic buds that offer a sweet and earthy mix of berry flavors. Tension and stress melt away from the body on the exhale while the mind elevates to lighthearted positivity.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Blackberry Trainwreck\n \n 6. Whitaker Blues\n\nWhitaker Blues is a classic indica-dominant strain that blends genetics from Quimby (a West Coast indica) and Blueberry. Breeder DJ Short is famous for his Blueberry line, but this strain was actually developed by his son, JD. A true indica in appearance and effect, Whitaker Blues grows into stout bushy plants and delivers a sedating stone that leaves you feeling heavy with dreamy bliss. Its flavors can span the entire spectrum of sweetness, so you may find yourself detecting anything from floral vanilla to fruity citrus. Whitaker Blues’ effects are initially enlivening but taper down into a deep transcendental calm conducive for meditation or lazy days.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Whitaker Blues\n \n 7. Double Barrel OG\n\nDouble Barrel OG offers a double shot of OG genetics as this hybrid combines White Fire OG with Raskal’s OG Kush. Its dense, resin-packed buds give rise to flavors both sweet and sour, a pungent fusion of sweet lemons and fuel-drenched pine. This hybrid travels straight to the head, launching you into thick euphoric lucidity that lets you forget any heaviness in mind or body. As the acute effects settle, Double Barrel OG eases you into a motivated and functional buzz perfect for afternoon productivity.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Double Barrel OG\n \nCheck out our other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or catch up on last week\u0027s New Strains Alert!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/12002409/new-strains-alert-strawberry-fields-kona-gold-blurple-blackberry.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-strawberry-fields-kona-gold-blurple-blackberry"}],"reviewCount":5,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":56.25},{"name":"Citrus","score":50}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":62.5},{"name":"Euphoric","score":31.25},{"name":"Hungry","score":31.25},{"name":"Sleepy","score":25},{"name":"Uplifted","score":25}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Headaches","score":50},{"name":"Pain","score":50},{"name":"Stress","score":50},{"name":"Cramps","score":25},{"name":"Inflammation","score":25}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":56.25},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":50},{"name":"Migraines","score":50},{"name":"PMS","score":50},{"name":"Arthritis","score":25}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dizzy","score":25},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":12.5},{"name":"Headache","score":6.25},{"name":"Paranoid","score":6.25},{"name":"Anxious","score":6.25}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/double-barrel-og_100x100_ba34.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/444524/b/double-barrel-og__primary_d092.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Eugene, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/double-barrel-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.2/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"White Fire OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-fire-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/white-fire-og","symbol":"Wif","applink":"leafly://strain/white-fire-og"},{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":62,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Would not consider a \"functional buzz\" as in getting things done, but could see it allowing someone pain relief to be functional enough to be productive. Taste was nothing to note, but smelled of citrus and aside from being smooth lacked characteristics of most OG\u0027s. Flower was a darker green, very dense so harder to smoke in joint, but not impossible, and worth the attempt ❤ Either way would say this strain is perfect for satisfying both a recreational desire for strong high and a medical desire for pain relief ❤","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3409","title":"New Strains Alert: Strawberry Fields, Kona Gold, Blurple, Blackberry Trainwreck, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1443207600000)\/","text":"These strains have just been added to the Leafly Explorer! For the ones you\u0027ve tried, you should leave a review reminiscing over all the good times with that strain. If you haven\u0027t had the chance to test any of these varieties out, don\u0027t fret — the links below will tell you whether or not that strain is being offered at a shop near you.\n \n 1. Strawberry Fields \n\nStrawberry Fields by Sagarmatha Seeds is an indica-dominant hybrid strain that takes the flavorful Strawberry Cough and crosses it with an undisclosed indica parent. This strain is destined for consumers who love that strawberry aroma, but would prefer something more tranquilizing than the Strawberry Cough sativa. Its heavier effects also make Strawberry Fields a better choice for patients treating pain, insomnia, and appetite loss.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Strawberry Fields\n \n 2. Blurple\n\nBlurple, also known as Blue Dream Purple, is a balanced hybrid cross between Blue Dream and Mendocino Purps. Its effects position themselves cerebrally at first, with gentle body relaxation that keeps you feeling light and free of tension. Drawing from both sides of the family, Blurple carries a sweet, dessert-like berry and grape aroma that comes to life on the inhale. This strain earns its name as bluish purple hues swirl throughout Blurple’s green buds.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Blurple\n \n 3. Kona Gold\n\nKona Gold is a sativa strain that has traveled far from its native origin, the volcanic soils of Hawaii’s Big Island. Soaring cerebral-focused euphoria captures the mind while leaving the body light and functional, making this sativa a perfect pair with or replacement for your morning cup of coffee. A tropical medley of pineapple and citrus flavors are cut by a sharp sour aroma that could almost be compared to diesel fuel. The authentic Kona Gold is unique to its mineral-rich homeland, but its replications overseas still have much to offer sativa enthusiasts.\n\nKona Gold is currently available at QPC in Everett, WA\n \n 4. Skunk 47\n\nSkunk 47, offspring of Skunk #1 and AK-47, is a sour-smelling hybrid strain that leans far to the indica side of the family. Bred by World of Seeds Bank, Skunk 47’s parents were selected for pungent aromas and fast flowering cycles. Additionally, Skunk 47 plants have a high resistance to mold and pests. Its indica tendencies come out strong in this strain’s effects, delivering a crushing heaviness perfect for stubborn pain or sleepless nights.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Skunk 47\n \n 5. Blackberry Trainwreck\n\nBlackberry Trainwreck, or Blackberry Wreck, is a hybrid strain parented by two notable varieties, Blackberry Kush and Trainwreck. Led by indica genetics, Blackberry Trainwreck typically grows into chunky, dense conic buds that offer a sweet and earthy mix of berry flavors. Tension and stress melt away from the body on the exhale while the mind elevates to lighthearted positivity.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Blackberry Trainwreck\n \n 6. Whitaker Blues\n\nWhitaker Blues is a classic indica-dominant strain that blends genetics from Quimby (a West Coast indica) and Blueberry. Breeder DJ Short is famous for his Blueberry line, but this strain was actually developed by his son, JD. A true indica in appearance and effect, Whitaker Blues grows into stout bushy plants and delivers a sedating stone that leaves you feeling heavy with dreamy bliss. Its flavors can span the entire spectrum of sweetness, so you may find yourself detecting anything from floral vanilla to fruity citrus. Whitaker Blues’ effects are initially enlivening but taper down into a deep transcendental calm conducive for meditation or lazy days.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Whitaker Blues\n \n 7. Double Barrel OG\n\nDouble Barrel OG offers a double shot of OG genetics as this hybrid combines White Fire OG with Raskal’s OG Kush. Its dense, resin-packed buds give rise to flavors both sweet and sour, a pungent fusion of sweet lemons and fuel-drenched pine. This hybrid travels straight to the head, launching you into thick euphoric lucidity that lets you forget any heaviness in mind or body. As the acute effects settle, Double Barrel OG eases you into a motivated and functional buzz perfect for afternoon productivity.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Double Barrel OG\n \nCheck out our other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or catch up on last week\u0027s New Strains Alert!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/12002409/new-strains-alert-strawberry-fields-kona-gold-blurple-blackberry.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-strawberry-fields-kona-gold-blurple-blackberry"}],"reviewCount":5,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":56.25},{"name":"Citrus","score":50}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":62.5},{"name":"Euphoric","score":31.25},{"name":"Hungry","score":31.25},{"name":"Sleepy","score":25},{"name":"Uplifted","score":25}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Headaches","score":50},{"name":"Pain","score":50},{"name":"Stress","score":50},{"name":"Cramps","score":25},{"name":"Inflammation","score":25}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":56.25},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":50},{"name":"Migraines","score":50},{"name":"PMS","score":50},{"name":"Arthritis","score":25}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dizzy","score":25},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":12.5},{"name":"Headache","score":6.25},{"name":"Paranoid","score":6.25},{"name":"Anxious","score":6.25}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/double-barrel-og_100x100_ba34.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/444524/b/double-barrel-og__primary_d092.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Eugene, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/double-barrel-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.2/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"White Fire OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-fire-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/white-fire-og","symbol":"Wif","applink":"leafly://strain/white-fire-og"},{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":62,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
