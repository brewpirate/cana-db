            "text": "Some people take astrology more seriously than others, but regardless of your level of obsession with all things zodiac, you at least know your star sign. That said, have you ever wondered which cannabis strain best reflects your astrological sign? We were curious so we took it upon ourselves to pair up the best strains that complement each personality type based on their horoscope sign.\nWhether you\u2019re as stubborn as a ram, as dramatic as a lion, or as balanced as a scale, we\u2019ve got a strain for you! So sit back, relax, and watch your stars and strains align.\nAries\n\nDates: \nMarch 21 \u2013 April 19\nCharacteristics: \nEnthusiastic, Energetic, Independent\nCannabis Strain: \n\nThis sativa-dominant strain will quell any unpleasant feelings with a soothing euphoric boost. Double Dream also offers relaxation with a creative focus and uplifting haziness to let you concentrate on the task at hand, awash in a warm wave of euphoria.\nTaurus\n\nDates: \nApril 20 \u2013 May 20\nCharacteristics: \nPractical, Loyal, Dependable\nStrain:\n\nThis sativa-dominant hybrid will uplift your spirit and instill a magical sense of euphoria. Your body will be buzzing and you\u2019ll be tickled Orange Haze with laughter.

A hybrid blend, GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) (and its many descendants) are sure to put a smile on your face and bring you peace and relaxation. This is the strain you\u2019ll want for when you\u2019re looking to laugh until you giggle-snort (and then laugh some more).\nLeo\n\nDates: \nJuly 23 \u2013 August 22\nCharacteristics: \nConfident, Dramatic, Enthusiastic\nStrain:\n\nAdmittedly, you\u2019re a drama queen, but this strain is guaranteed to lessen the drama and up the ante with joy. Your verbal skills fall dormant and allow someone else to take the spotlight for a change, while you will find yourself quietly in awe at the beauty of the world. Pineapple Express is a freight train that runs on euphoria \u2013 all aboard!\nVirgo\n\nDates: \nAugust 23 \u2013 September 22\nCharacteristics: \nAnalytical, Observant, Loyal\nStrain:\n\nFor the quietly observant Virgo, Space Queen is a hybrid that will help you out of your shell and make you feel relaxed and comfortable. This is a particularly good choice for those with social anxiety, as it\u2019s a highly fun, sociable strain that elicits easy conversation.\nLibra\n\nDates: \nSeptember 23 \u2013 October 22\nCharacteristics: \nPeaceful, Kind, Idealistic\nStrain:\n\nFor the peaceful Libra, nothing suits you better than a high-CBD strain. This sativa-dominant option offers a clear-headed focus that will allow you to get your tasks done with a warm smile on your face. Harlequin is also a wonderful meditation aid, offering relaxation without sedation. Namaste!\nScorpio\n\nDates: \nOctober 23 \u2013 November 21\nCharacteristics: \nPassionate, Intense, Observant\nStrain:\n\nThis hybrid is chock full of euphoric happiness. Lemon Skunk also tends to dissipate stress and allow your mind to wander freely through a mellow field of lemony goodness. This strain works whether you\u2019re feeling sociable or flying solo, and you may find yourself feeling some verbose inspiration.\nSagittarius\n\nDates: \nNovember 22 \u2013 December 21\nCharacteristics: \nAdventurous, Independent, Conversational\nStrain:\n\nAlien Asshat is as fantastic and ridiculous as it sounds. A perfect match for your adventurous soul, this strain rocks a super high THC content that will blow you out of this world and gear you up for a cosmic journey through space and time (or maybe just an epic hike).\nCapricorn\n\nDates: \nDecember 22 \u2013 January 19\nCharacteristics: \nResourceful, Organized, Disciplined\nStrain:\n\nMother\u2019s Helper is perfect for your inner coordinator as it swirls creativity through your mind.

You\u2019ll be the life of the party, albeit from the luxurious comfort of a reclined position on a comfy couch. You get the best of both worlds with a soothing dose of pain relief to boot.\nPisces\n\nDates:\nFebruary 9 \u2013 March 20\nCharacteristics: \nCompassionate, Imaginative, Escapist\nStrain:\n\nThis strain is one of the best for bonding with friends. Pure Power Plant offers a warm, clear-headed euphoria that\u2019s both uplifting and relaxing. Any leftover stress from your day will dissolve into psychedelic giggles and get you grooving to the music. Keep your eye drops handy, though \u2013 red eyes abound!",
