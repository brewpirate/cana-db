I was transformed into the man from Gallifrey!!  Upon exhale I entered the abyss of the T.A.R.D.I.S. in pure whovian bliss!! The air filled with scents of pineapple and grapes.  As i transcended all of time an space,  i was hurtled through the plains of de-stress from my flight from NY!  Then i weaved through the hills of No Mo Paine!  My mood was Thriving, uplifted,  and this creativity grew!   i wanted to love and be loved. Share this inspiring strain. You are travelling with the doctor to what seemed like a millenia! But what seemed like forever was a few hours of Triumphs over the Daleks,  Cybermen and the Weeping Angels! \n\n This by far has been one of my best strains to have ever come across!  it is a great representation of the Doctor.
