As soon as I cracked open the bag, my living room was saturated with the smell of fresh lemons with a hint of that classically spicy cannabis scent underneath. The flavor matched up with it perfectly; sweet and mild on the inhale with a tangy lemon aftertaste. Lemon Meringue’s high was delightfully cerebral, which led to a batch of homemade pop tarts and me reading an entire sci-fi novel in one day.\nBeing adventurous, trying new things, and exploring new options is an important part of every aspect of life, so this month was a great reminder to keep incorporating that attitude into my cannabis use as well.

I was impressed as soon as my budtender showed me the package, and it fully lived up to how it looked.\nThis strain was frosty with trichomes, the nugs were dense, and the scent was pure OG goodness. I found the high to be strong with a mild sativa-dominant effect, paired with a very pleasant body buzz. It’s perfectly versatile, suitable for a day of errands followed by an evening of movies. Of all the products I tried this month, this is the only one that drove me back for more, and I will be adding Dragon OG to my regular repertoire of strains.\nLemon Meringue by Avitas\n(Image courtesy of Avitas)\nProduct Type: Flower\nPrice: $16/gram\nLocation: Green Fire (SODO)\nThis citrusy-sweet sativa was delicious! As soon as I cracked open the bag, my living room was saturated with the smell of fresh lemons with a hint of that classically spicy cannabis scent underneath. The flavor matched up with it perfectly; sweet and mild on the inhale with a tangy lemon aftertaste. Lemon Meringue’s high was delightfully cerebral, which led to a batch of homemade pop tarts and me reading an entire sci-fi novel in one day.\nBeing adventurous, trying new things, and exploring new options is an important part of every aspect of life, so this month was a great reminder to keep incorporating that attitude into my cannabis use as well. Variety is the spice of life, after all…or is that cannabis?","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24121444/as-a-budtender.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/best-wa-marijuana-strains-and-products-march-2017"}],"reviewCount":18,"flavors":[{"name":"Ammonia","score":20},{"name":"Pine","score":20},{"name":"Chemical","score":20},{"name":"Diesel","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Berry","score":6.0897435897435894}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":46.6025641025641},{"name":"Euphoric","score":38.269230769230766},{"name":"Creative","score":36.346153846153847},{"name":"Uplifted","score":28.846153846153847},{"name":"Relaxed","score":28.846153846153847}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":12.5},{"name":"Stress","score":12.5},{"name":"Depression","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Cramps","score":4.1666666666666661},{"name":"Fatigue","score":4.1666666666666661}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":26.089743589743588},{"name":"PTSD","score":24.166666666666664},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":20},{"name":"Multiple Sclerosis","score":4.1666666666666661}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dizzy","score":24.166666666666664},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":21.923076923076923},{"name":"Paranoid","score":21.923076923076923}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dragon-og_100x100_4b01.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/587921/b/dragon-og__primary_6949.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Seattle, WA","Salem, OR","Eugene, OR","Everett, WA","Medford, OR","Beaverton, OR","Bellevue, WA","Corvallis, OR","Denver, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/dragon-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.44444444444444/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Red Dragon","subtitle":null,"slug":"red-dragon","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/red-dragon","symbol":"Red","applink":"leafly://strain/red-dragon"},{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
