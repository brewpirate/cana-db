            "text": "In honor of National Siblings Day, we decided to take a look at some of the most popular strains in cannabis and their offspring. There are quite a few strains that share genetics, but it just might surprise you to find out which strains are siblings.\n\u00a0 Granddaddy Purple\nGDP is one of the oldest and most well-known strains. Let\u2019s check out the\u00a0kiddos!\nCandyland\nThis sativa-dominant hybrid is an award-winning strain from GDP and Bay Platinum Cookies. Its sativa side stems from the Platinum Cookies parent, which was created from OG Kush, Durban Poison, and a third unknown strain. Candyland is a rare sativa known for its relaxing relief from muscle aches with the added benefit of uplifting and stimulating effects.\nCherry Pie\nCherry Pie is renowned for its strong effects and high potency. The offspring of two cannabis heavyweights\u2013GDP and Durban Poison\u2013Cherry Pie has a fruity flavor and a high that can last several hours. Although there are claims that this strain tastes like real cherry pie, others compare the flavor to berries, much like the flavor of GDP. This sweet strain will melt away your stress and bring on a strong craving for your favorite munchies!\n\n\u00a0 Blueberry\nBlueberry\u2019s fruity genetics provide the backdrop for some of the most common and delicious strains available.\nBlue Dream\nThe \u201cBlue\u201d in this sativa-dominant celebrity strain comes from the Blue in Blueberry, while the \u201cDream\u201d comes from another champion strain, Haze, a dreamy and euphoric sativa. Blue Dream is easily the most popular strain on Leafly, and its mild, uplifting effects make it the perfect strain for novice smokers.\nBerry White\nBerry White may be the offspring of two legendary strains, but this relaxing indica is famous in its own right for its balanced effects and a euphoric escape from stress and anxiety. With parentage from Blueberry and the epic hybrid\u00a0White Widow, Berry White tends to taste like overripe sour blueberries and offers such mind-bending effects that you may forget you have arms.\n\n\u00a0 Trainwreck\nA freight train of a hybrid strain, Trainwreck is sure to knock your socks off. What about its offspring?\nCasey Jones\nA little history lesson for you: Casey Jones is the name of a famous train engineer who was killed in a train wreck in 1900. However, for those of you who were raised on Saturday morning 90s cartoons, the name may sound more familiar as the hockey-masked vigilante from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Either way, this earthy sativa combines Oriental Express (an offshoot of Trainwreck and Thai) with East Coast Sour Diesel\u00a0to create a power-packed punch that\u2019s great for inspiring creativity.\nPineapple Express\nAh yes, everyone\u2019s favorite movie-turned-famous-strain is known for its fruity sweet undertones. But did you know that it has roots in the speedy hybrid, Trainwreck? Pineapple Express is more than just a famous name, it combines Trainwreck and Hawaiian for a long-lasting energetic buzz and a sweet mango and pineapple citrus flavor that makes for one golden afternoon.\n\n\u00a0 GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\nGSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) is the Genghis Khan of genetic stomp-arounds\u2013these days, it seems like there are Cookies genetics in every new strain.\nSunset Sherbet\nSunset Sherbet is the heir apparent to the GSC throne. It\u2019s known to have the heady, cerebral effects of GSC with an intoxicating boost from a heavy indica known as Pink Panties. Sunset Sherbet is so nicknamed due to its sweet, sherbet-like flavor, and tends to lean more heavily towards its indica roots than the standard GSC, so be prepared for a calm, relaxing high.\nMoon Cookies\nThis intergalactic herb crosses GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) with another phenotype of itself to create a complex woody, earthy scent with some strong, heavy indica-leaning relaxation. These buds are hard, dense, resinous rocks that taste like cookie dough and will send you soaring up to the stars. But don\u2019t consume too much Moon Cookies or you just might get lost in space.\n\n\u00a0 Jack Herer\nOne of the most notorious cannabis activists spawned this world-renowned sativa, and Jack Herer\u2018s litany of offspring continues to expand with no end in sight.\nXJ-13\nWhat sounds like a top-secret government experiment is actually one of the most delightfully uplifting hybrids you can find. XJ-13 combines Jack Herer\u2019s warm, fuzzy sativa genetics with the dreamy high of G13 Haze to create a stimulating and euphoric experience.\u00a0It\u2019s not heavy enough to make you feel asleep, but not stimulating enough to cause paranoia, giving consumers a perfectly balanced buzz that is high, happy, and carefree.\nDragon\u2019s Breath\nThis sativa-dominant hybrid was born of two heavyweight strains, Jack Herer and Northern Lights. The name Dragon\u2019s Breath is a reference to the spicy flavor and aroma accompanied by this hazy strain, but it won\u2019t burn you out. Instead, you can expect a clear-headed, energetic, productive high. But be forewarned\u2013too much of the Dragon may leave you feeling a bit paranoid.",

Maybe it was the trim job or maybe they name originates from the resemblance between the hairs and actual fire. Overall, an incredible sense of well being and mental calmness washes over after just a few hits. While it still remains very potently a sativa, the energy delivered was not overwhelming nor was it typical to other sativas i've had. Creativity overflows with this strain and makes for a pleasant day trip! Hands down the spiciest aroma i've ever encountered during my journeys, what a great strain!",
