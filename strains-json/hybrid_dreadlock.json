Patients and consumers chasing strains with mood-elevating properties stop their search at Dreadlock, a name derived from its dense, nappy buds. It produces heavy yields of sweet, musky flowers blanketed in crystal trichomes. A good strain for novice growers, Dreadlock plants are hardy and resilient when it comes to mold. Joint Doctor Seeds, the strain&rsquo;s original growers, recommend indoor soil gardens and the &ldquo;screen of green&rdquo; method. A full 9 weeks for flowering is suggested with Dreadlock, as it tends to gain a lot of weight and THC in its final mile.</p>\n",

            "text": "After depleting my Purple Kush supply, my guy got me this strain. \nHe said it was called that because the buds had mini-dreads in them. \nSorta. \nAfter the first puff, my throat got very dry and tight , which was odd considering the buds were fresh and a bit on the moist side. \n\nNo gradual take off here...this stone hits hard without warning. Within what felt like 10 seconds, my plastic summer chair felt like a lazy-boy. \nI felt a nice bolt of intellectual energy, tolerance and immediate love for the people who had cooked a nice meal. We were sitting outside and everything became instantly fascinating. \n\nThe downside is the roughness of it. My eyes were very red, my throat did not feel better after an hour. I knew driving would be a mistake, but the strain gives enough energy for a long walk. This must be amazing for people with chronic depression. \n\nThe buzz lasted much longer than anticipated. 3 hours in, after a normal toke, I was still flying.",
