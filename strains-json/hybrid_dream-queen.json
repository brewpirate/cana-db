            "text": "Pop music is a diverse and lenient genre that often accompanies many influences such as hip-hop, soul, dance, rap, and rock. The term \u201cpop\u201d is short for \u201cpopular,\u201d so the recognized sound of this genre has continually shifted over time. From the 60s, when The Beatles and rock music was considered pop, to today\u2019s landscape where you\u2019ll find pop artists ranging from soul singers to rappers, this lively genre will always be changing and evolving as the years wane on.\n\nPop music takes many forms, which means that there\u2019s probably an album out there that speaks solely to you. Below, explore five modern pop albums\u2014paired with their perfect strains\u2014for an elevating experience of our modern-day manifestation of an evolving genre.\nSeat at the Table by Solange\n(Columbia Records)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Dream Queen\nSolange released her third album, Seat at the Table, in 2016, and it quickly shot to the number one spot on Billboard 200. The 21-song album is an infusion of Solange\u2019s neo-soul, r&b sound. It\u2019s a refreshing number one album in a world of top 40 hits that often adhere to rigid, narrow hooks and phrasing. Seat at the Table has a deep, serene beauty from each calculated note to Solange\u2019s effortlessly melodic voice. With lyrics that speak to the black American experience and touch on topics such as prejudice and racism, A Seat at the Table is poignant, meaningful, and an important contribution to the artistic landscape of our times.\n\nMore Life by Drake\n(Republic Records)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Sage N Sour\nMore Life, Drake\u2019s 13th album, dropped in 2017. With over 80 minutes of music, it delivers an expressive and vibrant soundscape that is a delight to dive into. With songs such as \u201cMadiba Riddim,\u201d \u201cLose You,\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t Have Everything,\u201d and \u201cPassionfruit,\u201d Drake explores a wide variety of sounds that keeps it fresh and engaging throughout. Yet\u2014despite the variety\u2014each track contains Drake\u2019s quintessential style, tying it together with the genuine heart he puts into his work.\nLemonade by Beyonce\n(Columbia Records)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Electric Lemonade\nReleased in 2016, Lemonade took the music scene by storm\u2014and with good reason. A modern masterpiece, Lemonade is a deeply personal musical journey through romantic tribulations and black American life in the modern age. The album moves seamlessly through each song, leading the listener along a ride of emotional ups and downs. Anger, grief, joy, triumph, self-love\u2014Lemonade has it all. Paired with the visual album, it\u2019s easy to see why it made a major, lasting impact on the musical world.\n\nRainbow by Kesha\n(Kemosabe)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Cherry Thunder Fuck\nRainbow is Kesha\u2019s first album since 2014 due to her long legal battle with producer and abuser, Dr. Luke. Having now won back the rights to her own music, Kesha\u2019s album, Rainbow, is an anthem of freedom, triumph, and a spirit that refuses to quit. With songs such as \u201cPraying\u201d and \u201cBastard,\u201d which directly addresses the trials Kesha went through over the last few years, the album is deeply personal. On the other end, songs such as \u201cBoogie Shoes\u201d and \u201cWoman\u201d (featuring Dap Kings) are bursting with joy and strength, making Rainbow a well-rounded, emotional hit.\nThe Pinkprint (Deluxe) by Nicki Minaj\n(Republic)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Boss OG\nThe Pinkprint was released in 2014, but with Minaj hinting at a new 2018 release, there\u2019s plenty of reason to get hyped about this album all over again. With 23 songs on the roster, Pinkprint gives fans plenty to unwrap during her hiatus, and for those who only know her from the hit \u201cAnaconda,\u201d it\u2019s time to take a deeper look. The Pinkprint features a wide breadth of sound; the diverse tracks range in genre from hip-hop, soul, rap, to dance. Minaj brings all her talent to the table, showing off her skills as a great rapper and soulful singer. The contrast between songs such as \u201cFeeling Myself\u201d and \u201cGrand Piano\u201d exemplify Minaj\u2019s ability to embrace any sound she wants and she packages it all into one fire album.",

            "text": "Who doesn\u2019t love a good Netflix and chill sesh? Now that the days are getting shorter, the weather a little colder, and the sweatpants a little cozier, we thought we\u2019d peruse the list of new releases coming to Netflix in November to recommend a few options that would pair well with these delectable strains. If you find yourself interested in any of these streaming offerings, try to pick up the corresponding strains to enhance your Netflix and chill experience.\n\u00a0\nCOMEDIES\nMaster of None: Season 1\n\nDate Available: November 6\nThis new comedy series stars Aziz Ansari, who you may recognize as Tom Haverford from \u201cParks and Recreation.\u201d His new show follows the personal and professional life of a 30-year old actor in New York City.\nStrain Pairing: Black Domina\n\nIn homage to Ansari\u2019s Tom Haverford character and his food language, we thought a nice appetite-inducing strain like Black Domina would pair well with his new comedy series. Order up some chicky chicky parm parm and some big ol\u2019 cookies \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want to laugh on an empty stomach!\n\u00a0\nW/Bob & David\n\nDate Available: November 13\nThese two veteran comedians are back with another round of sketch comedy. The pair became notable for their first sketch series, Mr. Show with Bob and David, and each has enjoyed acclaim in separate television series (David Cross for \u201cArrested Development\u201d and Bob Odenkirk for \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d). So pull up a chair (just ask if you can use it first) and get ready for some good laughs!\nStrain Pairing: Fire Haze\n\nThis daytime sativa will help get the giggles going for a marathon sesh of sketch comedy, and its happy, uplifting effects will ensure that you won\u2019t lose steam while you binge-watch.\n\u00a0\nDOCUMENTARIES\nLast Days in Vietnam\n\nDate Available: November 1\nThis Oscar-nominated documentary explores the chaotic final weeks of the Vietnam War, when American soldiers and diplomats were faced with the tough decision to obey White House orders to evacuate only U.S. citizens, or whether they were willing to risk treason charges in order to save South Vietnamese citizens as well.\nStrain Pairing: Dream Queen\n\nThe hybrid strain Dream Queen should help balance the sobering effects of this wartime documentary by delivering uplifting relaxation while still allowing you to focus on the film.\n\u00a0\nSoaked in Bleach\n\nDate Available: November 15\nYes, it\u2019s another Kurt Cobain documentary. You may have heard of the film \u201cKurt Cobain: Montage of Heck\u201d that\u2019s been generating attention lately, but \u201cSoaked in Bleach\u201d follows a private investigator who had been hired by Courtney Love and his perspective on the death of the grunge legend.\nStrain Pairing: Chemdawg\n\nThe creative Chemdawg should help you tap into your inner artist as you revisit the life of one of the 90s\u2019 most iconic musicians.\n\u00a0\nFOR THE KID IN ALL OF US\nThe SpongeBob Squarepants Movie\n\nDate Available: November 1\nSometimes a \u201cNetflix and chill\u201d night is best spent watching a silly children\u2019s film, and SpongeBob Squarepants can deliver just that. Follow your favorite pineapple under the sea-dwelling creature and his pal Patrick as they attempt to track down King Neptune\u2019s stolen crown.\n[BLURB]\nStrain Pairing: Pineapple Express\n\nNothing should put a smile on your face like a silly animated feature paired with the grin-inducing Pineapple Express. You\u2019ll feel energetic and uplifted, plus the pineapple flavor is an all-too appropriate combination for Spongebob\u2019s humble abode.\n\u00a0\nSCI-FI/ACTION\nRobot Overlords\n\nDate Available: November 1\nOh no! Earth has been overtaken by alien robots, and it\u2019s up to Gillian Anderson and Ben Kingsley to save the day! If you\u2019re in the mood for a so-bad-it-might-be-good robot sci-fi film starring Gandhi and Scully, this ridiculous action/adventure offering could be right up your alley.\nStrain Pairing: Chocolope\n\nThis optimistic sativa will keep you happy long after the movie does, keeping you alert and energetic while you slog through what will either be a \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d or a \u201cnever again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMarvel\u2019s Jessica Jones: Season 1\n\nDate Available: November 20\nA superhero (the titular Jessica Jones) goes the private investigator route in this new Netflix original series based on the Marvel graphic novels. Starring a who\u2019s who of recognizable actors, including Krysten Ritter (who you may recognize from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d), David Tennant (\u201cDr. Who\u201d fans should know him all too well), and Carrie-Anne Moss (aka Trinity from \u201cThe Matrix\u201d trilogy), this show could be a fun entry into the ever-expanding Marvel universe.\nStrain Pairing: Bruce Banner\n\nWhat better pairing for a Marvel television series than this comic book character-inspired strain? The powerful Bruce Banner will settle you into a euphoric and creative state of mind, perfect for getting absorbed into the vast world of Marvel.\n\u00a0\nWILDCARD SELECTION\nThe Runner\n\nDate Available: November 5\nOh, Nicolas Cage. He\u2019s an actor so enigmatic that it\u2019s tough to decide whether he\u2019s good or bad. In \u201cThe Runner,\u201d he plays a sex scandal-plagued politician during the 2010 BP oil spill. Is this a \u201cgood\u201d Nic Cage flick or a \u201cbad\u201d one? Grab a strain and decide for yourself!\nStrain Pairing: LA Confidential\n\nThis potent indica has strong psychedelic effects, putting you in the perfect state of mind to fully embrace the Nic Cage experience. Whether your mind is blown or bored by this movie, you\u2019ll feel calm and relaxed enough to easily drift off to sleep afterwards.\nImage sources: IMDb",

The first thing is put makeup on and put music on in the background and it feels like you're living in the time that the song is playing. I know this probably doesn't make much sense to you reading this but it totally does to me in my head right now. Okay, the second thing to do when you're home alone and took this train is try to do some stretches or exercises. Your body will feel very strong like the Incredible Hulk, at least mine does right now. Okay I can't think of anything else to do but those two things should keep you busy for a while.",
