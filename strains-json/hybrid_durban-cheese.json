            "text": "THCV, or tetrahydrocannabivarin, is a compound in cannabis that offers a unique array of effects and medical benefits that sets it apart from other cannabinoids like THC and CBD. Whether you\u2019re a medical marijuana patient looking for a particular type of relief or a casual consumer chasing a specific effect, we\u2019d like to introduce you to this fascinating compound that\u2019s sure to make major waves in the cannabis world as we discover and utilize its full potential.\nWhat are THCV\u2019s Effects and Benefits?\nAs its name suggests, THCV is similar to THC in molecular structure and psychoactive properties, but it provides a variety of pronounced and altogether different effects. A note for vaporizer enthusiasts: THCV has a boiling point of 428 \u00b0F (220 \u00b0C), so you\u2019ll need to turn it up higher than you would THC.\n\n\nTHCV is an appetite suppressant. In contrast to THC, THCV may dull the appetite. This may be good for consumers focused on weight loss, but THCV should be avoided by patients treating appetite loss or anorexia.\nTHCV may help with diabetes. Research shows promise in THCV\u2019s ability to regulate blood sugar levels and reduce insulin resistance.\nTHCV may reduce panic attacks. It appears to curb anxiety attacks in PTSD patients without suppressing emotion.\nTHCV may help with Alzheimer\u2019s. Tremors, motor control, and brain lesions associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease appear to be improved by THCV, but research is in progress.\nTHCV stimulates bone growth. Because it promotes the growth of new bone cells, THCV is being looked at for osteoporosis and other bone-related conditions.\n\n\nWhere Can I Find THCV?\nSo you\u2019re looking for the effects mentioned above, but you aren\u2019t sure where to start your search for high-THCV strains and products. Most strains only contain trace, undetectable amounts of THCV, making it difficult to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. We can assume that more THCV-rich products will be introduced alongside its growing popularity, but in the meantime, here are some useful hints for locating this rare therapeutic gem.\n\nLook for African sativas. Lab results show that THCV is most abundant in sativas, particularly landrace strains from Africa. Durban Poison is one of the more common high-THCV strains, but other options can be found in the strain list below.\nAsk about parent genetics. Having trouble finding an African sativa? Plenty of strains have hybridized African genetics that predispose it to a higher THCV potential. Cherry Pie, for example, may express a high THCV content by way of its Durban Poison parent. Look for lineage information in Leafly\u2019s strain pages or ask your budtenders to point out their African hybrids.\nRequest test results. Genetics alone can\u2019t promise a high-THCV content, and cannabinoid contents can vary from harvest to harvest. If possible, ask your budtender for lab-tested strains to ensure that you\u2019re indeed getting a THCV-rich product.\n\n\nHigh THCV Cannabis Strains\nThis list is by no means comprehensive, but it includes strains best known for their tendency toward higher-than-average THCV contents. These strains can be consumed in flower form or they can be processed into extracts, oils, and edibles for a higher concentration of cannabinoids. A few of the strains below, like Doug\u2019s Varin and Pineapple Purps,\u00a0were specially bred to contain higher levels of THCV. Again, be sure to steer your choices toward African sativas as they tend to contain the most THCV.\n\n\n\n\nDoug\u2019s Varin\n\nPineapple Purps\n\nDurban Poison\n\n\n\nPower Plant\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nRed Congolese\n\n\n\nJack the Ripper\n\nDurban Cheese\n\nSkunk #1",
