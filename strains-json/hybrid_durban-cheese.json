These strains can be consumed in flower form or they can be processed into extracts, oils, and edibles for a higher concentration of cannabinoids. A few of the strains below, like Dougâ€™s Varin and Pineapple Purps,Â were specially bred to contain higher levels of THCV. Again, be sure to steer your choices toward African sativas as they tend to contain the most THCV.\n\n\n\n\nDougâ€™s Varin\n\nPineapple Purps\n\nDurban Poison\n\n\n\nPower Plant\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nRed Congolese\n\n\n\nJack the Ripper\n\nDurban Cheese\n\nSkunk #1","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/29195248/what-is-thcv-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-this-cannabinoid.jpg","urlslug":"/news/cannabis-101/what-is-thcv-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-this-cannabinoid"}],"reviewCount":19,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":51.5625},{"name":"Lemon","score":50.78125},{"name":"Citrus","score":50},{"name":"Blue Cheese","score":2.34375},{"name":"Cheese","score":2.34375}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":55.46875},{"name":"Euphoric","score":8.59375},{"name":"Relaxed","score":5.46875},{"name":"Focused","score":4.6875},{"name":"Giggly","score":4.6875}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":57.03125},{"name":"Pain","score":54.6875},{"name":"Headaches","score":50},{"name":"Nausea","score":2.34375},{"name":"Depression","score":1.5625}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":50.78125},{"name":"PTSD","score":50},{"name":"Migraines","score":0.78125}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":5.46875},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.125},{"name":"Paranoid","score":3.125},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.5625},{"name":"Headache","score":0.78125}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/durban-cheese_100x100_fd40.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/530838/b/durban-cheese__primary_ca43.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/durban-cheese_100x100_de99.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/474667/b/durban-cheese__primary_5baa.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/durban-cheese_100x100_0930.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/328714/b/durban-cheese__primary_de00.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/durban-cheese_100x100_618c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/313004/b/durban-cheese__primary_f957.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/durban-cheese_100x100_2860.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/188716/b/durban-cheese__primary_37c1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/durban-cheese_100x100_2335.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/180445/b/durban-cheese_825x550_f881.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":11,"popularCities":["San Mateo, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/durban-cheese","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.15789473684211/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Durban Poison","subtitle":null,"slug":"durban-poison","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/durban-poison","symbol":"Dp","applink":"leafly://strain/durban-poison"},{"name":"Cheese","subtitle":null,"slug":"cheese","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese","symbol":"Che","applink":"leafly://strain/cheese"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
