            "text": "I've always been a fan of ATF, and in my experience I haven't met someone who hasn't been a fan of anything Dutch. First time trying this strain and for anyone who's dealing with anxiety disorders or anything the like, I highly recommend this strain. My weapon of choice was my 30 inch beaker (by roor), so with that being said, I was experiencing the effects a bit sooner than anything else. It usually takes me a few dabs to reach my desired \"high\" but with a couple of bowls I was at the perfect level. It's a subtle high at first with a relaxed euphoric state (this is when more of the sativa kicks in... at least for me this was my experience). You get a mild sense of sedation but nothing compared to the extent of true \"couch lock\" as you would with any of the Gorilla Glues. Overall I was pleased with my harvest of Dutch Thunder Fuck, and can definitely see myself getting this strain in a larger amount sometime in the near future. ",
