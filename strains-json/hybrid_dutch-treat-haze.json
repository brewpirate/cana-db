To do less in the best way possible, you need to create an atmosphere and game plan that fits the mood.\nLuckily, we’ve gone out and done the hard work for you. Just as we did with November 2015\u0027s Netflix release list, we urge you to use our guide to plan out a variety of Netflix and chill sessions for the month of December.\n \n1. Have a #TBT Night\nWatch: F is for Family\nGenre: Animated Sitcom\nChill Situation: The new series created by comedian Bill Burr and written by Michael Price (you might know him as an award-winning writer for The Simpsons) is a family comedy set in the 1970s, “a time when you could smack your kid, smoke inside, and bring a gun to the airport.\" Though it’s based on Burr’s childhood, he actually voices the father, Frank Murphy, while his wife is played by Laura Dern, and his sons by Justin Long and Haley Reinhart. You can check out the trailer to get excited until the six-episode season debuts on December 18.\nSnack of Choice: A TV dinner or a Wonder Bread sandwich only seems fitting.\nVibe: To enhance a nostalgic night in, pick up some Deep Chunk. This strain has roots in Afghanistan and was brought to Northern California in the 1970’s, which means that from the first puff, you’ll recognize that iconic smoke and happy, relaxing stone. For best results, grind up some Deep Chunk for use in your vaporizer.\n \n2. Nurse a Night Out’s Next Day\nWatch: Real Rob\nGenre: Comedy Series\nChill Situation: The eight-episode series starring Rob Schneider is meant to be an exaggerated but honest depiction of his real life and follows him as he manages \"the ups and downs of a Hollywood career,\" according to the release. Let the painfully awkward moments of this show remind you that whatever happened last night couldn’t have been nearly as embarrassing as whatever Schneider experiences. Debuts December 1.\nSnack of Choice: Your favorite breakfast sandwich, enjoyed in bed.\nVibe: After a night out, to ease an aching head and a grumpy belly, check out Blue Moonshine. This strain comes from the famed DJ Short, and with heavy indica roots, it will quell your aches and have you chillaxing and giggling. Blue Moonshine works magic for aches, pains, and appetites — just watch out for any resulting sleepiness.\n \n3. Host a Holiday Gathering\nWatch: A Very Murray Christmas\nGenre: Musical Comedy\nChill Situation: Bill Murray made a Christmas musical, so if you were looking for a holiday miracle this year, chances are this is it. In the story, Murray is putting on a TV variety show but is worried no one will be able to come because of a massive snowstorm hitting New York. With the help of lots of famous friends including George Clooney, Amy Poehler, Miley Cyrus, Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, Jenny Lewis, Chris Rock, and more, the show goes on. It’s directed by Sofia Coppola. There is no way this won’t be incredible. And there is nothing more Murray than this 24-second teaser video. Available December 1.\nSnack of Choice: Cookies! Roasted chestnuts! Hot cocoa!\nVibe: For the perfect complementary strain, look no further than Dutch Treat Haze. With the sociable influence of Dutch Treat combined with the uplifting cerebral effects of Haze, this strain is the perfect balance for socializing with friends and family, laughing your buns off, and chowing down on all the holidays treats your tummy can handle.\n \n4. Throw an Adam Sandler Roast Party\nWatch: The Ridiculous Six\nGenre: Western Comedy\nChill Situation: People have been lamenting and mocking Adam Sandler’s downward trajectory for a while now, but let us not forget that he gave us classics like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy before, you know, agreeing to be in Paul Blart: Mall Cop. The Ridiculous Six is sure to offer some of the absurdity noted in the title as well as some stereotypes, as it’s a satire of western movies from the 1970s. But with a cast including Steve Buscemi, Luke Wilson, Terry Crews, and Will Forte, there are sure to be some laughs. Debuts December 11.\nSnack of Choice: Rare steaks and potatoes.\nVibe: For maximum lolz, check out Hippie Crippler. This sativa-dominant hybrid offers a happy, focused high, along with a relaxing vibe to keep you engrossed in supremely enjoying the movie. If you can find it, Hippie Crippler in concentrate form is a delightfully tasty way to indulge and enhance your funny bone.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12000017/december-2015-netflix-and-chill-your-monthly-guide-to-the-art-of.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/december-2015-netflix-and-chill-your-monthly-guide-to-the-art-of"}],"reviewCount":48,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":15.113636363636363},{"name":"Citrus","score":12.272727272727273},{"name":"Sweet","score":11.780303030303031},{"name":"Lemon","score":11.136363636363637},{"name":"Grapefruit","score":7.2348484848484853}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":32.424242424242422},{"name":"Uplifted","score":29.090909090909093},{"name":"Relaxed","score":24.128787878787879},{"name":"Creative","score":22.916666666666664},{"name":"Euphoric","score":17.954545454545453}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":16.174242424242426},{"name":"Stress","score":14.545454545454547},{"name":"Pain","score":6.7424242424242422},{"name":"Fatigue","score":6.1742424242424239},{"name":"Inflammation","score":5.0378787878787881}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":18.939393939393938},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":5.0378787878787881},{"name":"Arthritis","score":4.46969696969697},{"name":"PTSD","score":4.46969696969697},{"name":"Muscular Dystrophy","score":3.3333333333333335}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":12.272727272727273},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.9015151515151518},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.56818181818181823}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_d620.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/564077/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_4e12.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_faee.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/514447/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_1e73.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_106c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/503883/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_4044.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_efcd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/371856/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_0d29.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":4,"popularCities":["Bothell, WA","Boulder, CO","Colorado Springs, CO","Denver, CO","Durango, CO","Fraser, CO","Gig Harbor, WA","Granite Falls, WA","Idaho Springs, CO","Keizer, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.54166666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Dutch Treat","subtitle":null,"slug":"dutch-treat","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat","symbol":"Dt","applink":"leafly://strain/dutch-treat"},{"name":"Super Silver Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"super-silver-haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/super-silver-haze","symbol":"Ss","applink":"leafly://strain/super-silver-haze"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":77,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

With the sociable influence of Dutch Treat combined with the uplifting cerebral effects of Haze, this strain is the perfect balance for socializing with friends and family, laughing your buns off, and chowing down on all the holidays treats your tummy can handle.\n \n4. Throw an Adam Sandler Roast Party\nWatch: The Ridiculous Six\nGenre: Western Comedy\nChill Situation: People have been lamenting and mocking Adam Sandler’s downward trajectory for a while now, but let us not forget that he gave us classics like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy before, you know, agreeing to be in Paul Blart: Mall Cop. The Ridiculous Six is sure to offer some of the absurdity noted in the title as well as some stereotypes, as it’s a satire of western movies from the 1970s. But with a cast including Steve Buscemi, Luke Wilson, Terry Crews, and Will Forte, there are sure to be some laughs. Debuts December 11.\nSnack of Choice: Rare steaks and potatoes.\nVibe: For maximum lolz, check out Hippie Crippler. This sativa-dominant hybrid offers a happy, focused high, along with a relaxing vibe to keep you engrossed in supremely enjoying the movie. If you can find it, Hippie Crippler in concentrate form is a delightfully tasty way to indulge and enhance your funny bone.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12000017/december-2015-netflix-and-chill-your-monthly-guide-to-the-art-of.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/december-2015-netflix-and-chill-your-monthly-guide-to-the-art-of"}],"reviewCount":48,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":15.113636363636363},{"name":"Citrus","score":12.272727272727273},{"name":"Sweet","score":11.780303030303031},{"name":"Lemon","score":11.136363636363637},{"name":"Grapefruit","score":7.2348484848484853}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":32.424242424242422},{"name":"Uplifted","score":29.090909090909093},{"name":"Relaxed","score":24.128787878787879},{"name":"Creative","score":22.916666666666664},{"name":"Euphoric","score":17.954545454545453}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":16.174242424242426},{"name":"Stress","score":14.545454545454547},{"name":"Pain","score":6.7424242424242422},{"name":"Fatigue","score":6.1742424242424239},{"name":"Inflammation","score":5.0378787878787881}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":18.939393939393938},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":5.0378787878787881},{"name":"Arthritis","score":4.46969696969697},{"name":"PTSD","score":4.46969696969697},{"name":"Muscular Dystrophy","score":3.3333333333333335}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":12.272727272727273},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.9015151515151518},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.56818181818181823}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_d620.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/564077/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_4e12.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_faee.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/514447/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_1e73.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_106c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/503883/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_4044.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_efcd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/371856/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_0d29.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":4,"popularCities":["Bothell, WA","Boulder, CO","Colorado Springs, CO","Denver, CO","Durango, CO","Fraser, CO","Gig Harbor, WA","Granite Falls, WA","Idaho Springs, CO","Keizer, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.54166666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Dutch Treat","subtitle":null,"slug":"dutch-treat","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat","symbol":"Dt","applink":"leafly://strain/dutch-treat"},{"name":"Super Silver Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"super-silver-haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/super-silver-haze","symbol":"Ss","applink":"leafly://strain/super-silver-haze"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":77,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Not energetic but not lazy, mostly just a nice, relaxing, calm sensation. I was more open to things (because I wasn\u0027t nervous), I allowed myself to enjoy things I would usually be put off by, the creativity was flowing, all that good stuff. Sometimes I would find myself getting distracted in the middle of something or losing focus, but it was usually more of a sign that I wasn\u0027t enjoying what I was doing. Since the feeling of this is so calm, I was able to sleep at a reasonable time and I didn\u0027t wake up with that \u0027afterglow\u0027 feeling.                   \n                                           \nPhysical-  \nI felt like headaches were more painful and the munchies are real, I will say that. Other than that, not much to report on the physical side of things. I don\u0027t deal with body pain so I\u0027m not a good judge of that. This isn\u0027t a couch lock feeling. I wasn\u0027t more perceptive of my touch or any of that. I really didn\u0027t notice much, but I have no clue what it would do for body pain.                 \n                                       \nOverall-  \n4/5, mostly out of personal preference. I prefer my sativas to feel more energetic, and this was more on the \u0027chill and feel comfortable\u0027 kind of thing. Which isn\u0027t bad. It\u0027s just not my preference. It also isn\u0027t a long lasting sensation, so you will be smoking/vaping/whatever more frequently than with other sativas (Super Silver Haze or Strawberry Cough as two examples of other sativas). And finally I\u0027m not big on how much this stimulated my appetite; I\u0027m a tall skinny guy with no schedule to my eating, so when the munchies hit it felt like my stomach was being crunched up. But this will be a regular for me and I will definitely give it 4/5 because the pros outweigh the cons and as far a sativa dominant strain goes, this does what it\u0027s supposed to do and while it might be a little bit different it\u0027s a very, very enjoyable experience.  \n                                           \nThings that didn\u0027t affect this review: The flower itself was very beautiful. I purchased 7 grams and each nug was very full, coated in trichomes, fantastic aroma when you grind it up, a very satisfying \u0027snap\u0027 when I broke off a piece from a nug. The taste and smell were both quite earthy but very pleasant. I enjoyed smoking this every time. This batch was grown by Project M in Washington. Very nice job.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1571452,"username":"mrosoloco","text":"If you haven’t tried Dth then your missing out in a great strain.

To do less in the best way possible, you need to create an atmosphere and game plan that fits the mood.\nLuckily, we’ve gone out and done the hard work for you. Just as we did with November 2015\u0027s Netflix release list, we urge you to use our guide to plan out a variety of Netflix and chill sessions for the month of December.\n \n1. Have a #TBT Night\nWatch: F is for Family\nGenre: Animated Sitcom\nChill Situation: The new series created by comedian Bill Burr and written by Michael Price (you might know him as an award-winning writer for The Simpsons) is a family comedy set in the 1970s, “a time when you could smack your kid, smoke inside, and bring a gun to the airport.\" Though it’s based on Burr’s childhood, he actually voices the father, Frank Murphy, while his wife is played by Laura Dern, and his sons by Justin Long and Haley Reinhart. You can check out the trailer to get excited until the six-episode season debuts on December 18.\nSnack of Choice: A TV dinner or a Wonder Bread sandwich only seems fitting.\nVibe: To enhance a nostalgic night in, pick up some Deep Chunk. This strain has roots in Afghanistan and was brought to Northern California in the 1970’s, which means that from the first puff, you’ll recognize that iconic smoke and happy, relaxing stone. For best results, grind up some Deep Chunk for use in your vaporizer.\n \n2. Nurse a Night Out’s Next Day\nWatch: Real Rob\nGenre: Comedy Series\nChill Situation: The eight-episode series starring Rob Schneider is meant to be an exaggerated but honest depiction of his real life and follows him as he manages \"the ups and downs of a Hollywood career,\" according to the release. Let the painfully awkward moments of this show remind you that whatever happened last night couldn’t have been nearly as embarrassing as whatever Schneider experiences. Debuts December 1.\nSnack of Choice: Your favorite breakfast sandwich, enjoyed in bed.\nVibe: After a night out, to ease an aching head and a grumpy belly, check out Blue Moonshine. This strain comes from the famed DJ Short, and with heavy indica roots, it will quell your aches and have you chillaxing and giggling. Blue Moonshine works magic for aches, pains, and appetites — just watch out for any resulting sleepiness.\n \n3. Host a Holiday Gathering\nWatch: A Very Murray Christmas\nGenre: Musical Comedy\nChill Situation: Bill Murray made a Christmas musical, so if you were looking for a holiday miracle this year, chances are this is it. In the story, Murray is putting on a TV variety show but is worried no one will be able to come because of a massive snowstorm hitting New York. With the help of lots of famous friends including George Clooney, Amy Poehler, Miley Cyrus, Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, Jenny Lewis, Chris Rock, and more, the show goes on. It’s directed by Sofia Coppola. There is no way this won’t be incredible. And there is nothing more Murray than this 24-second teaser video. Available December 1.\nSnack of Choice: Cookies! Roasted chestnuts! Hot cocoa!\nVibe: For the perfect complementary strain, look no further than Dutch Treat Haze. With the sociable influence of Dutch Treat combined with the uplifting cerebral effects of Haze, this strain is the perfect balance for socializing with friends and family, laughing your buns off, and chowing down on all the holidays treats your tummy can handle.\n \n4.

Not energetic but not lazy, mostly just a nice, relaxing, calm sensation. I was more open to things (because I wasn\u0027t nervous), I allowed myself to enjoy things I would usually be put off by, the creativity was flowing, all that good stuff. Sometimes I would find myself getting distracted in the middle of something or losing focus, but it was usually more of a sign that I wasn\u0027t enjoying what I was doing. Since the feeling of this is so calm, I was able to sleep at a reasonable time and I didn\u0027t wake up with that \u0027afterglow\u0027 feeling.                   \n                                           \nPhysical-  \nI felt like headaches were more painful and the munchies are real, I will say that. Other than that, not much to report on the physical side of things. I don\u0027t deal with body pain so I\u0027m not a good judge of that. This isn\u0027t a couch lock feeling. I wasn\u0027t more perceptive of my touch or any of that. I really didn\u0027t notice much, but I have no clue what it would do for body pain.                 \n                                       \nOverall-  \n4/5, mostly out of personal preference. I prefer my sativas to feel more energetic, and this was more on the \u0027chill and feel comfortable\u0027 kind of thing. Which isn\u0027t bad. It\u0027s just not my preference. It also isn\u0027t a long lasting sensation, so you will be smoking/vaping/whatever more frequently than with other sativas (Super Silver Haze or Strawberry Cough as two examples of other sativas). And finally I\u0027m not big on how much this stimulated my appetite; I\u0027m a tall skinny guy with no schedule to my eating, so when the munchies hit it felt like my stomach was being crunched up. But this will be a regular for me and I will definitely give it 4/5 because the pros outweigh the cons and as far a sativa dominant strain goes, this does what it\u0027s supposed to do and while it might be a little bit different it\u0027s a very, very enjoyable experience.  \n                                           \nThings that didn\u0027t affect this review: The flower itself was very beautiful. I purchased 7 grams and each nug was very full, coated in trichomes, fantastic aroma when you grind it up, a very satisfying \u0027snap\u0027 when I broke off a piece from a nug. The taste and smell were both quite earthy but very pleasant. I enjoyed smoking this every time. This batch was grown by Project M in Washington. Very nice job.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1571452,"username":"mrosoloco","text":"If you haven’t tried Dth then your missing out in a great strain.

To do less in the best way possible, you need to create an atmosphere and game plan that fits the mood.\nLuckily, we’ve gone out and done the hard work for you. Just as we did with November 2015\u0027s Netflix release list, we urge you to use our guide to plan out a variety of Netflix and chill sessions for the month of December.\n \n1. Have a #TBT Night\nWatch: F is for Family\nGenre: Animated Sitcom\nChill Situation: The new series created by comedian Bill Burr and written by Michael Price (you might know him as an award-winning writer for The Simpsons) is a family comedy set in the 1970s, “a time when you could smack your kid, smoke inside, and bring a gun to the airport.\" Though it’s based on Burr’s childhood, he actually voices the father, Frank Murphy, while his wife is played by Laura Dern, and his sons by Justin Long and Haley Reinhart. You can check out the trailer to get excited until the six-episode season debuts on December 18.\nSnack of Choice: A TV dinner or a Wonder Bread sandwich only seems fitting.\nVibe: To enhance a nostalgic night in, pick up some Deep Chunk. This strain has roots in Afghanistan and was brought to Northern California in the 1970’s, which means that from the first puff, you’ll recognize that iconic smoke and happy, relaxing stone. For best results, grind up some Deep Chunk for use in your vaporizer.\n \n2. Nurse a Night Out’s Next Day\nWatch: Real Rob\nGenre: Comedy Series\nChill Situation: The eight-episode series starring Rob Schneider is meant to be an exaggerated but honest depiction of his real life and follows him as he manages \"the ups and downs of a Hollywood career,\" according to the release. Let the painfully awkward moments of this show remind you that whatever happened last night couldn’t have been nearly as embarrassing as whatever Schneider experiences. Debuts December 1.\nSnack of Choice: Your favorite breakfast sandwich, enjoyed in bed.\nVibe: After a night out, to ease an aching head and a grumpy belly, check out Blue Moonshine. This strain comes from the famed DJ Short, and with heavy indica roots, it will quell your aches and have you chillaxing and giggling. Blue Moonshine works magic for aches, pains, and appetites — just watch out for any resulting sleepiness.\n \n3. Host a Holiday Gathering\nWatch: A Very Murray Christmas\nGenre: Musical Comedy\nChill Situation: Bill Murray made a Christmas musical, so if you were looking for a holiday miracle this year, chances are this is it. In the story, Murray is putting on a TV variety show but is worried no one will be able to come because of a massive snowstorm hitting New York. With the help of lots of famous friends including George Clooney, Amy Poehler, Miley Cyrus, Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, Jenny Lewis, Chris Rock, and more, the show goes on. It’s directed by Sofia Coppola. There is no way this won’t be incredible. And there is nothing more Murray than this 24-second teaser video. Available December 1.\nSnack of Choice: Cookies! Roasted chestnuts! Hot cocoa!\nVibe: For the perfect complementary strain, look no further than Dutch Treat Haze. With the sociable influence of Dutch Treat combined with the uplifting cerebral effects of Haze, this strain is the perfect balance for socializing with friends and family, laughing your buns off, and chowing down on all the holidays treats your tummy can handle.\n \n4. Throw an Adam Sandler Roast Party\nWatch: The Ridiculous Six\nGenre: Western Comedy\nChill Situation: People have been lamenting and mocking Adam Sandler’s downward trajectory for a while now, but let us not forget that he gave us classics like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy before, you know, agreeing to be in Paul Blart: Mall Cop. The Ridiculous Six is sure to offer some of the absurdity noted in the title as well as some stereotypes, as it’s a satire of western movies from the 1970s. But with a cast including Steve Buscemi, Luke Wilson, Terry Crews, and Will Forte, there are sure to be some laughs. Debuts December 11.\nSnack of Choice: Rare steaks and potatoes.\nVibe: For maximum lolz, check out Hippie Crippler. This sativa-dominant hybrid offers a happy, focused high, along with a relaxing vibe to keep you engrossed in supremely enjoying the movie. If you can find it, Hippie Crippler in concentrate form is a delightfully tasty way to indulge and enhance your funny bone.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12000017/december-2015-netflix-and-chill-your-monthly-guide-to-the-art-of.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/december-2015-netflix-and-chill-your-monthly-guide-to-the-art-of"}],"reviewCount":48,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":15.113636363636363},{"name":"Citrus","score":12.272727272727273},{"name":"Sweet","score":11.780303030303031},{"name":"Lemon","score":11.136363636363637},{"name":"Grapefruit","score":7.2348484848484853}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":32.424242424242422},{"name":"Uplifted","score":29.090909090909093},{"name":"Relaxed","score":24.128787878787879},{"name":"Creative","score":22.916666666666664},{"name":"Euphoric","score":17.954545454545453}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":16.174242424242426},{"name":"Stress","score":14.545454545454547},{"name":"Pain","score":6.7424242424242422},{"name":"Fatigue","score":6.1742424242424239},{"name":"Inflammation","score":5.0378787878787881}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":18.939393939393938},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":5.0378787878787881},{"name":"Arthritis","score":4.46969696969697},{"name":"PTSD","score":4.46969696969697},{"name":"Muscular Dystrophy","score":3.3333333333333335}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":12.272727272727273},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.9015151515151518},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.56818181818181823}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_d620.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/564077/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_4e12.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_faee.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/514447/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_1e73.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_106c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/503883/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_4044.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dutch-treat-haze_100x100_efcd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/371856/b/dutch-treat-haze__primary_0d29.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":4,"popularCities":["Bothell, WA","Boulder, CO","Colorado Springs, CO","Denver, CO","Durango, CO","Fraser, CO","Gig Harbor, WA","Granite Falls, WA","Idaho Springs, CO","Keizer, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.54166666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Dutch Treat","subtitle":null,"slug":"dutch-treat","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat","symbol":"Dt","applink":"leafly://strain/dutch-treat"},{"name":"Super Silver Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"super-silver-haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/super-silver-haze","symbol":"Ss","applink":"leafly://strain/super-silver-haze"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":77,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
