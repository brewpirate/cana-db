            "text": "As a budtender, trying and evaluating new strains, products, and brands is all a part of the job.\u00a0This March, I set out to try a bunch of new-to-me products and narrow them down to my top five favorites. Two of the strains I tried, however, were so good that I couldn\u2019t make myself choose between them, which is a wonderful problem to have. These six flowers and concentrates were my favorite finds in March, and I highly recommend making a trip to one of these shops to pick some up for yourself!\n\nBlueberry Pancakes by Nebula Gardens\n(Image courtesy of Nebula Gardens)\nProduct Type: Flower\nPrice: $45/eighth\nLocation: Fweedom Cannabis (Mountlake Terrace)\nIt has been a long time since I opened a package of flower with the word \u201cBlueberry\u201d on the label and actually thought, \u201cWow, that smells like blueberries.\u201d Enter Nebula Gardens to save the day! I picked up an eighth of Blueberry Pancakes\u00a0based on the recommendation of a friend and fellow budtender and was extremely glad I did. Its smell and flavor were both exactly what I expected\u2014sweet and mild with a genuinely berry-esque aftertaste. The high was well balanced between a mild body buzz and classic, giggly euphoria.\nJack\u2019s Cleaner BHO by Mother Nature\u2019s Own\n(Image courtesy of Mother Nature\u2019s Own)\nProduct Type: Concentrate/Butane Hash Oil\nPrice: $25/gram\nLocation: Green Lady (Everett)\nWhen I worked for a medical dispensary, Jack\u2019s Cleaner was my absolute favorite strain that we carried. From the first time I tried it, the sharp and piney citrus taste and incredibly clear-headed high had me amazed. It has never once let me down, so when I see it on the shelves, I\u2019ll always give it a try.\nThis wax was priced so well that I admit I was a little hesitant to try it, despite my friend\u2019s recommendation. But the quality is shockingly impressive for the price point and the high is just as clear-headed and focused as I remember. I\u2019m letting that serve as an important reminder to myself: A low price doesn\u2019t always mean low quality, and the same is definitely true in the other direction; pricey cannabis doesn\u2019t necessarily ensure quality.\nDutch Treat by Clandestine Gardens\n(Image courtesy of Clandestine Gardens)\nProduct Type: Flower\nPrice: $13/gram\nLocation: Ruckus (Capitol Hill)\nSeeing classic strains done the right way is surprisingly rare in the adult-use market (I said something similar about the Blueberry strain I tried this month, but it bears repeating). This Dutch Treat was a great representation of the traditional strain, providing a well-balanced, primarily cerebral high accompanied by a sharp, piney flavor profile.\nWhite Widow Ice Wax by TerpCo\n(Image courtesy of TerpCo)\nProduct Type: Bubble Hash\nPrice: $40/gram\nLocation: Fweedom Cannabis (Seattle)\nGenerally speaking, I\u2019m not a big fan of bubble hash. I know it\u2019s cleaner. I know it\u2019s overall better for me. But it\u2019s just not my thing. I don\u2019t care for the residue that even full-melt hash leaves on my nail, and the flavor tends to be similar across the board, leaving little strain-specific flavor to be had.\nThere are some definite exceptions to this rule (such as Polar Icestracts, a former medical producer that makes amazing hash with high-quality flower from stellar cultivator Gold Leaf Gardens), and I\u2019m glad to have found another. This White Widow from TerpCo gave me a whole new perspective on ice wax\u2013and you don\u2019t even have to pay top dollar to experience it.\nDragon OG by Avitas\n(Image courtesy of Avitas)\nProduct Type: Flower\nPrice: $54/eighth\nLocation: Higher Leaf (Bellevue)\nI have to admit, I chose this one purely based on name (something I often discourage my customers from doing) and I did not expect it to be nearly as good as it was. I was impressed as soon as my budtender showed me the package, and it fully lived up to how it looked.\nThis strain was frosty with trichomes, the nugs were dense, and the scent was pure OG goodness. I found the high to be strong with a mild sativa-dominant effect, paired with a very pleasant body buzz. It\u2019s perfectly versatile, suitable for a day of errands followed by an evening of movies. Of all the products I tried this month, this is the only one that drove me back for more, and I will be adding Dragon OG to my regular repertoire of strains.\nLemon Meringue by Avitas\n(Image courtesy of Avitas)\nProduct Type:\u00a0Flower\nPrice: $16/gram\nLocation:\u00a0Green Fire (SODO)\nThis citrusy-sweet sativa was delicious! As soon as I cracked open the bag, my living room was saturated with the smell of fresh lemons with a hint of that classically spicy cannabis scent underneath. The flavor matched up with it perfectly; sweet and mild on the inhale with a tangy lemon aftertaste. Lemon Meringue\u2019s high was delightfully cerebral, which led to a batch of homemade pop tarts and me reading an entire sci-fi novel in one day.\nBeing adventurous, trying new things, and exploring new options is an important part of every aspect of life, so this month was a great reminder to keep incorporating that attitude into my cannabis use as well. Variety is the spice of life, after all\u2026or is that cannabis?",

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Dutch Treat is a popular strain in the Pacific Northwest thanks to its recognizable sweet piney scent, quality yields, and well-balanced high. This hybrid comes from British Columbia, not Amsterdam as the name might suggest. The high leans heavily on the indica side of the spectrum while still offering euphoric sativa traits.\nGrow Techniques: Dutch Treat takes off indoors in either a hydroponic or soil setup. Its solid bud structure makes it popular with inexperienced trainers. Keep the lower half of the plant clear to send energy up to the colas.\nFlowering Time: 6-8 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Easy\nClimate: Temperature should rest between 68-80 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep airflow up and humidity down to protect the quality of the buds.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Dutch Treat can be grown indoors or out, but inside growing helps bring out its popular aroma and protects its terpenes.\nFeeding: \u00a0Standard nutrients and feeding will keep this low-maintenance plant happy.",

The stuff is out there, but in a felony possession state, you rarely know what you're getting. \n\nNow that I was able to pick, I found myself on the Dutch Treat. It greeted me with the thick Hazelike terp profile, tacked onto a sweet, earthy backdrop. A fascinatingly distracting smoke, this is best for after the day is over. The effects pile on prominently and seem to come in waves. \nClean, crisp body high. \n\nAs you can tell by the long rambling review, I can see this one being good for creative endeavors too.",
