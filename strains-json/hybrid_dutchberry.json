To house such a powerhouse strain, Artizen moves in tandem with their flower from growth to packaging\u2014and delivers some excellent buds. We love that they slow down and take a little time with their cannabis crops from start to finish.\n\nPineapple by Fire Bros.\nAvailable in: Washington\nA Seattle favorite, Fire Bros. works with their own phenotypes to produce the most effective cannabis flower for consumers.

Grown in organic fertilizer free of pesticides, Lowell takes pride in their dedication to all-natural cannabis as well as in providing good wages for their workers.\nAlso featured in: What Are You Smoking? Episode 3\nZkittlez by Royal Choice Farms\nAvailable in: Arizona\nArizona does not require pesticide testing for cannabis, so it\u2019s all the more important to find a grower you can trust.

By instating natural grow methods, Royal Choice keeps our minds at ease when we\u2019re lighting up their sweet indica Zkittles.\n\nCBD Blue Shark by Marley Natural Red\nAvailable in: California, Oregon, Washington*\nWith a full cannabis operation dedicated to Jamaica\u2019s rich culture, Marley Natural hits it out of the park with their hand-selected flower line\u2014notably, the anti-inflammatory and CBD-rich hybrid CBD Blue Shark.

Licensed since 2014, Royal Tree Farms has been producing fantastic cannabis ever since, and their sativa-dominant Black Cherry Soda is no exception. We\u2019ve been packing our bowls with this strain for its potent relief, particularly for the medical patients among us.\nDo-Si-Dos by Matrix NV\nAvailable in: Nevada\nOne of the best in medical-grade cannabis production, Nevada\u2019s Matrix NV keeps their focus on the people who will consume their products, and that\u2019s why we love them. Their flower, including the deliciously heavy indica Do-Si-Dos, is cared for by a team of passionate people who use purified and organic products to cultivate their hand-trimmed flower collection.\nAlso featured in: Leafly TV\u2019s Growers: Episode 101\n\nOrange Blossom by Falcanna\nAvailable in: Washington\nA small medical operation turned Tier III licensed producer, Falcanna has seen it all when comes to cannabis\u2014from the garden to the shop. Their dedication to the herb started as a dream between founders Bethany and Justin Rondeau and turned into a full grow facility delivering exceptional cannabis across Washington State. Their bright, floral hybrid Orange Blossom is as tasty as it is elevating and provides a perfect example of their dedication to quality flower.\nWhite Tahoe Cookies by Archive Portland\nAvailable in: Oregon\nWith multiple awards under their belt, Archive Portland boasts a team of growers with over 35 years of collective cannabis growing experience. That dedication to quality trickles down to the buds, where the exceptional indica White Tahoe Cookies takes on a smooth sedative high that keeps us coming back for more.\nLemonder by Seattle\u2019s Private Reserve\nAvailable in: Washington\nWe save Seattle\u2019s Private Reserve flower for special occasions; grown in a facility that is tightly sealed and meticulously controlled, the euphoric hybrid Lemonder has found its way into our stash boxes and smoke circles throughout 2017. SPR\u2019s rigorous testing of all their cannabis products lets us consume with full peace of mind.\nLead image by\u00a0Nastasic/iStock\n*Editor\u2019s note: Leafly and Marley Natural are owned by the same parent company. Also, Marley Natural Red is available in California, Oregon, and Washington but may be a different high-CBD strain in each market.",

This is a great Sativa hybrid plenty of energy and focus mixed in with a little overall body relaxation and some pressure behind the eyes. The buds look absolutely amazing they're dense and frosty to the extreme also quite sticky and resinous. It smells sweet and citrus and when a put some in a grinder it is extremely pungent and skunky (like really good weed should). Deffinetly more of a get out and get things done kinda strain not so much the kick back and watch some Netflix kind, still perfect for during the work week. This is an awesome strain that can usually be picked up for around 50 bucks with the prices the way they are right now this is a great deal if you're looking for a Sativa hybrid. ",
