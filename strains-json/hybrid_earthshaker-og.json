            "text": "We updated the Leafly database with some new strains! Do any of them look familiar? Hopefully so, because these newcomers are in need of some user reviews. Let us know what you thought of Earthshaker OG, SleeStack, NY Cheese, and the many other recently added varieties!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Earthshaker OG\n\nEarthshaker OG, also known as P.O. #3, is a variety of OG Kush from Progressive Options Genetics. The powerful sativa-dominant effects are known to sneak up on you with a smooth and lengthy buzz. The buds express themselves in deep shades of green and smell like a mix of skunk and sharp cheese. The flavors produced by Earthshaker OG are earthy and hashy with sweet notes of citrus and lemongrass.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. SleeStack\n\nSleeStack is a sativa-dominant hybrid bred by DNA Genetics. The large yields and sharp fuel flavors of Schrom combine with the vigorous growth and pungent, piney flavors of Martian Mean Green to create an uplifting hybrid with a rich fragrance. The effects of SleeStack have been described as energetic and alert, without causing paranoia or adding to anxieties. SleeStack is also known to create top-notch concentrates with heavy resin production and an intricate flavor profile.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Nice Cherry\n\nNice Cherry is an indica-dominant strain that captures the flavorful qualities of its Cherry parent and the relaxing attributes of Mr. Nice. With an aroma of sweet skunk, pine, and berry, Nice Cherry delivers a rush of cerebral energy that lifts the mood while relaxing the body. It\u2019ll also bring an edge back to your appetite while providing focus to keep you productive.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Dog Shit\n\nDog Shit is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain named for its aroma, which bears a striking resemblance to its namesake. For the novelty-seekers not turned off by its name and smell, Dog Shit provides uplifting euphoria that elevates the mood while crushing stress. This strain has an elaborate genetic background that is said to stem from Purple Zacatecas, Colombian Gold, Cambodian, and Hippie Trail Afghani.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Hippie Chicken\n\nHippie Chicken is a mostly sativa strain with strongly euphoric effects that border on psychedelic \u2013 hence the name. A cross between Blueberry and Alaskan Thunder Fuck, Hippie Chicken takes after its sativa parent in its giggly, energetic effects which are accented only slightly by the tingly, relaxing effects passed down by Blueberry.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Maui Mango Diesel\n\nMaui Mango Diesel is a sativa-dominant hybrid of Maui Waui and Brooklyn Mango bred by Pua Mana 1st Hawaiian Pakal\u014dl\u014d Seed Bank. The Maui Waui father was sourced from Lower N\u0101hiku Maui, while the mother is Dr. Underground\u2019s Brooklyn Mango. Their combination results in a flavorful mix of sweet mango and tropical flavors that invigorate the senses and uplift your mood.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. NY Cheese\n\nNY Cheese, a rumored hybrid cross between Cheese and NYC Diesel, provides cerebrally-focused euphoria that stimulates creativity, conversation, and a positive mood. Good for daytime use, NY Cheese delivers its effects with a spark of energy that helps you stay productive and focused. This sativa-dominant strain is a great way to bring your appetite back to life or for knocking down stress while going about your day.",
