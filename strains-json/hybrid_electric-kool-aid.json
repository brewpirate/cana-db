            "text": "finished my first sesh with this beautiful berry strain today. Being a slightly sativa dominate strain, you really can have the best of both worlds with Electric Kool Aid. Wowee wow the euphoria given off those grape hinted, crystal covered buds when lit is spectacular. The forrest reminiscent scent is pungent & tickles your nostrils. The taste is tarty, berriful. Very pleasant and mellow. The experience is just the first of many to come but through my first toking of this strain I felt relaxed, at peace (& I was playing online FIFA trust me it's not easy to be calm during these things.) I didn't get sluggish for quite awhile being able to play some matches & get some things done around the house as well. The finale to this blissful strain is the sleepy satisfaction when you can crash into your furniture or bed. I highly suggest you try this strain, it's a perfect afternoon strain. \ud83d\ude01",
