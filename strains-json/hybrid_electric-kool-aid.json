Being a slightly sativa dominate strain, you really can have the best of both worlds with Electric Kool Aid. Wowee wow the euphoria given off those grape hinted, crystal covered buds when lit is spectacular. The forrest reminiscent scent is pungent \u0026 tickles your nostrils. The taste is tarty, berriful. Very pleasant and mellow. The experience is just the first of many to come but through my first toking of this strain I felt relaxed, at peace (\u0026 I was playing online FIFA trust me it\u0027s not easy to be calm during these things.) I didn\u0027t get sluggish for quite awhile being able to play some matches \u0026 get some things done around the house as well. The finale to this blissful strain is the sleepy satisfaction when you can crash into your furniture or bed. I highly suggest you try this strain, it\u0027s a perfect afternoon strain. üòÅ","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1541964,"username":"isolo","text":"Great aroma and wonderful full-body high.  10/10 would 100% recommend!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3243","title":"New Strains Alert: C3PO, Blucifer, Electric Kool Aid, Blue Mountain Fire, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1453493460000)\/","text":"The Leafly strain database was just updated with some new cannabis varieties!
