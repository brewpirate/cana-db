It is so uplifting, it has become a personal essential. It can bring hope into the worst day of your life and will bring you a smile for the present moment. It is so relaxing and calming. The flavor is quite nice; overly earthy with an exotic wood scent that I can't quite pinpoint. Aromatic AF. This is a beautiful strain and I recommend it for anything and everything. Green Life Productions nailed this strain.",
