            "text": "I picked this strain based on its appearance and the terpenes. I mean, this badboy was DANK. Fire is correct. However... if youre prone to anxiety, or paranoia? This is NOT the strain for you. And this is the reason I gave our lovely flower here only 3 stars. My own personal experiences with this one was like a reoccurring nightmare. i kept trying, but it would just INSTANTLY take me to a very bad place. But, i believe this would be a great strain for others. I will admit, though; i kept a nice fat nug of it around and on occasion id bring it out and just admire its beauty. the structure on this one, the color, the fiery pistils-  just gorgeous! alas... guys like me? simply cant imbide in this one... ill have to settle for a museum like experience. : )\nCheers!",
