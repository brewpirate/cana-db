            "text": "Firing up a documentary whilst high is hardly a new idea, but it\u2019s usually a good one (hello, Planet Earth). There\u2019s so much to learn and explore via films that showcase\u00a0unique and mind-bending experiences\u2014especially with a little help from a well-packed bowl. Additionally, the truthfulness of\u00a0documentaries comes\u00a0as a breath of fresh air amid\u00a0the throngs of lowbrow comedies and overly intense dramas that tend to flood the average\u00a0Netflix queue.\n\nTo elevate\u00a0this classic cannabis-enhanced\u00a0activity, we mined the opinions of the staff at the Leafly office and compiled a list of the best documentaries to watch while high. In narrowing from a list that included scores of suggestions, I personally\u00a0vetted\u00a0the top picks to\u00a0bring you the following finalists. From explorations of history to non-verbal spectaculars, there\u2019s a bit of something for everyone below. Spark up a pre-roll\u00a0or bake a batch of\u00a0edibles, then get comfortable on the couch and press play\u2014we\u2019re willing to bet you\u2019ll\u00a0discover\u00a0a new favorite.\nRecently watched a noteworthy documentary? Tell us about it in the comments below!\nCave of Forgotten Dreams\n\nFamed documentary director Werner Herzog knocked it out of the park\u2014yet again\u2014with his video exploration of the Chauvet Cave of Southern France. Discovered by three explorers in 1994, the\u00a0cave houses ancient paintings that are the oldest ever recorded in human history, dating back between 28,000 and 35,000 years. The paintings are perfectly preserved\u2014along with the bones of long extinct animals\u2014having never been touched by natural light or exposure to the elements.\nBefore watching this film, I lit up some Blue Dream and even through a small computer screen (I, uh\u2026don\u2019t own a TV), the paintings, their meanings, and Herzog\u2019s beautifully crafted narrative combined to create a film that was\u00a0truly breathtaking. Long after the film ended, I thought about the person or people who\u00a0made these, the gods they\u00a0may have worshipped, the natural world in which they\u00a0lived, and the ancient culture to which they\u00a0belonged.\nI doubt sober thoughts would have gravitated toward the essence and deeper meaning these paintings hold in regard to human life and the history of mankind like my Blue Dream-induced thoughts did. I recommend this documentary for the music, the art, the history, the curiosity\u2014everything about it.\nGoing Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\n\nDocumentaries exploring religious sects or cults are my bread and butter. Documentaries exploring religions that are widely\u00a0regarded as cults are even better\u2014the extra-sweet jam to that bread and butter. Enter Going Clear, an eye-opening expose of L. Ron Hubbard and his imaginative, interwoven ideals of science fiction and religion that ultimately led to the creation of the Church of Scientology.\nIn\u00a0this documentary, we hear stories from\u00a0ex-Scientologists. These aren\u2019t just \u201ctried it out for a week and left\u201d Scientologists\u2014these people were indoctrinated into the religion for years, even decades, before getting out. Some moved up to the highest levels of the religion\u00a0before calling it quits.\nSober, this is an interesting journey down the rabbit hole of Scientology. High, this documentary will open your thoughts to science, religion, and how people respond to both in a whole new light. Load a bowl of the buzzy White Fire OG before pressing play.\nSamsara\n\nNonverbal and utterly\u00a0breathtaking, Samsara is the younger sister to the popular 1992 documentary\u00a0Baraka (the previous nonverbal narrative exploration of nature and human life). Like Bakara, Samsara was directed by Mond Russell and produced by Mark Magidson, so the quality and feel stay true to the original.\nSamsara will leave you in awe of its gorgeous, lingering landscapes, and rich visions of people from all over the world. This colossal documentary took five years to film and spanned about 25 countries.\nThroughout this entire spectacular, cannabis will keep your eyes peeled\u00a0and your mind enamored with this hour-and-a-half film of explosive color and life. Creative strains such as Pineapple Trainwreck or Berry White\u00a0will let your mind completely soak in this remarkable\u00a0film.\nFor an extra boost, check out the classic\u00a0Koyaanisqatsi\u00a0which pre-dates Samsara by about 20 years. The score is done by the famous composer Philip Glass\u00a0with cinematography by Ron Fricke\u00a0(who also worked on Samsara and Baraka). Though Koyaanisqatsi may not be as visually crisp as Samasara or Baraka, it was the core inspiration for both stunning films.\n\nBeware of Mr. Baker\n\nThe colorful life of Ginger Baker, legendary drummer of the popular rock bands Cream and Blind Faith, is front and center in this exploratory documentary. Rock legends laud him as the greatest drummer who ever lived, but the \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d of Baker\u2019s life shows a volatile man with a short fuse and passionate air.\nHe\u2019s a true character in every sense of the word, having traveled the world and experienced a life that only one in a billion could mirror. Though hard\u00a0drug use and angry outbursts (mostly fueled by said hard drug use) clouded his legend, his life story remains\u00a0remarkable in every way.\nRegardless of whether or not you know who Ginger Baker is, this film is fascinating\u00a0and will appeal to everyone\u2014especially lovers of rock music. I recommend lighting up a little\u00a0Durban Poison as you watch this film.\nInto the Inferno\n\nWerner Herzog makes another appearance on this list with his relatively new Netflix documentary\u00a0Into the Inferno. Much like Cave of Forgotten Dreams, Into the\u00a0Inferno touches on the history of human life. After delving into the world of volcanic activity, Herzog explores the religions that have developed across cultures greatly influenced by local volcanic eruptions.\nIn true Herzog style, the documentary approaches these subjects with both historical and artistic flair. Some of the most touching and beautiful points in the film are the sweeping shots of erupting volcanoes punctuated with classical or operatic music.\nJuxtaposed with these beautiful shots are scenes of ceremonial activities conducted by worshippers who believe certain volcanoes house spirits of long-dead loved ones and mighty gods. Also wrapped up with all this is the discovery of an ancient human fossil as well as the recounting of the lives of two famous volcano photographers. In short, Herzog does quite a lot with this film, and it\u2019s all compelling.\nYet\u00a0another amazing documentary that, when paired with cannabis,\u00a0leaves you contemplating it days after the credits roll. Reach for some Stardawg\u00a0to pair with\u00a0this incredible film.\nTickled\n\nFor something well\u00a0off the beaten path in terms of documentaries, I suggest you\u00a0sit down and watch Tickled. It starts off innocently enough, with the director, David Farrier, simply wanting to explore an interesting subject: the world of endurance tickling. Sure, it\u2019s an odd sport to most, but why not get a feel for something a bit different? No harm \u2026 right?\n\u2026Right?\nWell, much to the filmmakers\u2019 surprise\u2014as well as my own\u2014there is a bit of harm in exploring the unknown. Not to give too much away, the endurance competitions held by professional ticklers are\u00a0more than just a good laugh.\nYou\u2019ll be on the edge of your seat while Farrier dives down the deep and twisty hole that goes straight to the mystifying and sometimes terrifying underworld of tickling competitions. To really get into this film, you\u2019ll want to have\u00a0some Permafrost\u00a0close at hand\u2014its\u00a0effects will help take the edge off the strangeness\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0documentary.",
