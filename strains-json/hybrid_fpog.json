This beautifully crafted indica dominant is the absolute best strain I've ever had and has consistently been my favorite for years. A relaxing body high with equal parts head high make Fruity Pebbles the perfect strain for after a long stressful day. Now the flavor, oh boy the FLAVOR! If anyone told me that weed could taste exactly like the delicious cereal from my childhood, I might have started smoking a long time ago. Sweet and berry with tropical and citrus notes underneath, FPOG will have you craving a bowl (pun intended.) The first time I had Fruity Pebbles, it was from a dispensary in Seattle that's no longer open. But good news for you all, almost every FPOG strain I've had tastes just as good (and don't even get me started on concentrates!) I highly recommend this strain to new users and connoisseurs alike!",
