This beautifully crafted indica dominant is the absolute best strain I\u0027ve ever had and has consistently been my favorite for years. A relaxing body high with equal parts head high make Fruity Pebbles the perfect strain for after a long stressful day. Now the flavor, oh boy the FLAVOR! If anyone told me that weed could taste exactly like the delicious cereal from my childhood, I might have started smoking a long time ago. Sweet and berry with tropical and citrus notes underneath, FPOG will have you craving a bowl (pun intended.) The first time I had Fruity Pebbles, it was from a dispensary in Seattle that\u0027s no longer open. But good news for you all, almost every FPOG strain I\u0027ve had tastes just as good (and don\u0027t even get me started on concentrates!) I highly recommend this strain to new users and connoisseurs alike!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/gn1KTn64cc9D8CRBNayJF1tnfB4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net%2fqmB_VhteSAycRoRafB7zBQ8q7r0%3d%2f120x120%2fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3.amazonaws.com%252Fleafly%252Fbin%252FmstpXGgRuu3rPFHmtQHb_aviator-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":725,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":52.88147231194754},{"name":"Tropical","score":49.77974313843059},{"name":"Berry","score":46.430738767141833},{"name":"Grape","score":30.167392797044545},{"name":"Citrus","score":24.567706620761687}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":90.013067929053591},{"name":"Euphoric","score":89.6641264192182},{"name":"Happy","score":88.559880369818757},{"name":"Uplifted","score":69.524948743738037},{"name":"Tingly","score":49.985916616699868}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":59.52447728283785},{"name":"Depression","score":45.475667782054508},{"name":"Pain","score":43.424208429237346},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":40.148038722655265},{"name":"Insomnia","score":33.118435813620628}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":31.283123150422625},{"name":"PTSD","score":17.007287093092977},{"name":"Arthritis","score":10.622981180247963},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":10.605150287228485},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":7.862275391191659}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":43.287907874122361},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":33.991242915997759},{"name":"Dizzy","score":9.5643096845322138},{"name":"Anxious","score":9.3244086187888033},{"name":"Paranoid","score":9.1806734879402718}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/fpog/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/fpog/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/fruity-pebbles_100x100_6860.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1006220/b/fruity-pebbles__primary_73ba.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/fruity-pebbles_100x100_6f27.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1006209/b/fruity-pebbles__primary_6036.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/fruity-pebbles_100x100_e106.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1003300/b/fruity-pebbles__primary_eb47.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/fruity-pebbles_100x100_304d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000970/b/fruity-pebbles__primary_d25e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/fruity-pebbles_100x100_05fb.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/679727/b/fruity-pebbles__primary_f5bb.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/fruity-pebbles_100x100_4812.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/627444/b/fruity-pebbles__primary_2e4f.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":192,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA","Seattle, WA","Portland, OR","Everett, WA","Montr√©al, QC","Bellingham, WA","Denver, CO","Hamilton, ON","Vancouver, BC","Calgary, AB"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/fpog","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.4151724137931/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Green Ribbon","subtitle":null,"slug":"green-ribbon","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/green-ribbon","symbol":"Grr","applink":"leafly://strain/green-ribbon"},{"name":"Granddaddy Purple","subtitle":null,"slug":"granddaddy-purple","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/granddaddy-purple","symbol":"Gdp","applink":"leafly://strain/granddaddy-purple"},{"name":"Tahoe Alien","subtitle":null,"slug":"tahoe-alien","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien","symbol":"Tah","applink":"leafly://strain/tahoe-alien"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":59,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
