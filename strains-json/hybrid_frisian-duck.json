Generally speaking, strains will exhibit differences in resin production, coloration, stature, and shape. Other times, cannabis will express itself with features you‚Äôve probably never seen firsthand. Below are five of the most unique and unusual genetic traits found in cannabis plants from all around the world. Whether by genetic mutation, environment, or factors unknown, these cannabis oddities are sure to stand out in any cannabis garden.\nAlbino Cannabis\n\n\n\n\n\n Couldn\u0027t resist posting another picture of this beauty showing one of the two tone buds.  This is one of our more unique plants in the outdoor garden, this plant is displaying variegation characteristics.  This anomaly occurs when the genes controlling the production of chlorophyll are not expressed correctly resulting in albino characteristics. There will be a very limited supply of this \u0026 we\u0027ll let you know which retailer will be carrying it.  #albinocannabis #whitecannabis #wanorml #norml #normllife #womengrow #fineweed #wafinestcannabis #marijuana #modernfarmer #mjfarm #pesticidefree #legalmarijuana #legalmj #i502 #cannabis #peaceloveandcannabis\nA post shared by  Washington\u0027s Finest Cannabis (@washingtons_finest_cannabis) on Oct 2, 2015 at 7:01pm PDT\n\n\n\nAlbinism is a rare genetic mutation that occurs in humans, animals, and plants such as cannabis. An albino plant is one that grows with the complete or partial absence of chlorophyll pigmentation, causing the plant to appear lighter or white in color. The plants must contain some chlorophyll to perform photosynthesis (the process by which plants covert light energy into food), so albino plants may never make it to maturity before dying.\n\nDr. Grinspoon\n\n\n\n\n\n #420Magazine #Marijuana #DrGrinspoon #its420somewhere\nA post shared by  420 Magazine (@420magazine) on May 6, 2015 at 12:19pm PDT\n\n\n\nThe spindly strain called Dr. Grinspoon¬†was dedicated to the longtime cannabis advocate and professor at Harvard, Dr. Lester Grinspoon. In the early 60s, Dr. Grinspoon condemned the use of cannabis as its popularity grew, but came to endorse it after studying the plant. He found that the information that was being shared to the public was not supported by his research and felt that the public was being strongly misled.\nThis strain is a pure sativa heirloom that typically invites creativity, energy, and cerebral activity. Bred by Barneys Farm in Amsterdam, it grows with a bizarre stature: Instead of developing bud sites at the nodes of the branches, Dr. Grinspoon grows small buds that decorate the plant like berries on a holly plant. Because of its unconventional appearance, this¬†strain is also a solid choice for growers seeking subtlety in their garden.\nDr. Grinspoon is not a high yielding strain and has a 14-week flowering period, making it an unpopular strain among commercial growers. But novelty-seeking cultivators raising this potent sativa will be rewarded with a truly unique product.\nPolyploid Cannabis\n\n\n\n\n\n More shots of the weird mohawk bud üëΩüëæ phenotype‚Äã. #mohawk #phenohunters #macro #santacruz #scfarms #pistils #calyx #trichomes #faded #polyploid #flowers #alien\nA post shared by  Santa Cruz Farms LLC (@scfarms) on Mar 5, 2017 at 1:44pm PST\n\n\n\nPolyploidy occurs in plants that contain more than two sets of chromosomes in their genetic makeup. While most cannabis plants are simply diploid (two sets of chromosomes), many growers find that polyploid cannabis plants produce larger flowers with resilience to disease and pests. While this mutation in animals is often destructive, it is generally successful in plants. Many flowering plants have picked up extra chromosomes, and this mutation has often helped them become adaptive and resilient.\nBuddha Seeds from Spain has been exploring polyploidy for a number of years now with the goal of producing more potent, high-yielding strains. The mutation is difficult to work with and difficult to clone, making polyploid cannabis plants few and far between.\n\nFrisian Duck¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n Frisian Duck! http://tinyurl.com/Buyduckseeds #dutchpassion #dutchpassion #outdoorweedisthebest #harvesttime #frisianduckfoot #frisianduck #frisianduckfoot #frisianduckseeds #dutchpassion\nA post shared by  Dutch Passion (@dutchpassionseedcompany) on Sep 8, 2015 at 12:21pm PDT\n\n\n\nFrisian Duck, a cross between¬†Frisian Dew and Ducksfoot, was bred by Dutch Passion out of Amsterdam. While Frisian Dew was produced as a high-yielding outdoor strain, ‚ÄúDucksfoot‚Äù is a unique mutation that results in oddly shaped cannabis leaves. This cross holds on to the Ducksfoot leaf pattern while producing beautiful deep purple buds that are compact with spicy notes of citrus and pine.\nA targeted benefit of Frisian Duck is stealth. With leaves that look nothing like a normal cannabis plant, Frisian Duck became a great strain for growers seeking to raise cannabis incognito.\nBlack Haze\n\n\n\n\n\n Black Haze ‚òÅ üî• #blackhaze #exoticstrain #gumdrop #shimmerandshine #dank #gas #cannabis #marijuana #herb #herblife #420 #hippylife #medicinal #legalizeit\nA post shared by  Kush Dreamz (@kush_dreamin_420) on Dec 27, 2017 at 7:37pm PST\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not unusual to see vibrant or dark shades of purple in cannabis, but some strains achieve hues so distinct, you‚Äôll likely never forget them.¬†Black Haze is one of those strains, and as the name suggests, it oftentimes produces flowers that are near-black in color. Produced by Exotic Seed in Europe, this strain is an autoflowering variety that crosses Sir Jack x Skunk Auto and Pakistani Chitral Kush.\nOther strains that sometimes express unusually dark hues include Black Lemon, Black Domina, Black Dahlia, and Black Diesel. Cannabis may also uniquely express blue, pink, and red coloration.\n\nPinkman Goo\n\n\n\n\n\n Interview about my exclusive \" Pinkman Goo \" 3way hybrid ( GDPXGrape Ape ) x northern lights 5 by @merryjane see more about plant guttation at its finest,  subscribe youtube.com/CaliCropDoc for video updates\nA post shared by  CaliCropDoc ‚Äì Grower Education (@calicropdoc_) on Mar 10, 2016 at 4:10pm PST\n\n\n\nPinkman Goo is a strain developed by Twompson Prater of Cali Crop Doc. Discovered while growing a few unidentified seeds found by his sister, Pinkman Goo was named after observing little balls of goo secreted by the buds 3-4 weeks into flowering. It‚Äôs up for debate how the goo balls are created, but one theory hypothesizes that they result from nighttime ‚Äúrespiration‚Äù after the plant‚Äôs stomata close.\nHave you come across any unusual cannabis strains?

These cannabis strains illustrate how we, the cannabis community, appropriate parts of our history‚Äîwhether from television or music, art or science, we pay homage to the green giants whose shoulders we stand upon. Leafly is growing thanks to you: the farmer, the scientist, the lawyer, the activist, the outspoken, the patient, the connoisseur. With the 4th of July behind us and 710 in front of us, the cannabis community has plenty of reasons to keep celebrating. Cheers!\n¬†¬†Cello Sweet OG\n\nColorado Seed Inc. pays homage to new school and old school genetics in Cello Sweet OG. This cross combines DJ Short‚Äôs Flo, a living cannabis virtuoso, and Secret Garden OG, CO Seed‚Äôs Kush bomb, to create a connoisseur-quality strain with potency and dimension. With effects that range from cerebral to sedative, this strain contains movements like a symphony, rising into a meditative mind with a decrescendo into full-body relaxation.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†Bloo\u0027s Kloos\n\nBloo‚Äôs Kloos is a playful indica with a carefree buzz that encourages laughter. This three-way cross of Larry OG, Blueberry, and Northern Lights imbues Bloo\u0027s with earthy and fruity terpenes that turn sweet when consumed. Created by Mr. Mack out of Las Vegas, this strain leaves the mind clear and the body free of aches and pains.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†Diamond Socks\n\nDiamond Socks, named for the dense layer of trichomes coating the plant (and a juicy reggae track), is an invigorating hybrid with roots in a rare strain of Hawaiian Silverback. The structure and growth pattern is indicative of its Kush genetics, leading to a handsome yield and aromatic floral overtones. Hit this mid-range flower for a buzz that is active in the mind and relaxed in the body. This strain is another Hawaiian rarity stabilized and transplanted by Colorado Seed Inc.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†Purple People Eater\n\nPurple People Eater is the lanky indica-dominant cross of (Lapis Mnt. Indica x GDP) x (Afghan x Purple Urkle) that has been known to produce green and purple buds that smell pungent and earthy. These multifaceted buds are herbaceous with a flavor of sweet grape. Enjoy this strong sedative at the end of the day to soothe physical discomfort and restlessness.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†Mekamika Haze\n\nMekamika Haze won Best Sativa at the 2015 Amsterdam Unity Cup. This pure landrace sativa supposedly hails from the Amazon and shares genetics with another mysterious strain, Mango Rossa (Manga Rosa from Brazil). The bright, lanky sativa is a challenge to grow, but attentive farmers are rewarded with beautiful buds that smell of tropical citrus and mango with pungent, earthy undertones.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†Frisian Duck\n\nFrisian Duck is a structurally unique strain developed by Dutch Passion. Its genetics were bred over several generations of Frisian Dew x Duckfoot. The genetics from Duckfoot (named for its oddly shaped leaves that resemble duck feet) allows this plant to hide in plain sight, making it ideal for outdoor grows. Frisian Duck is also rather hardy and able to thrive in harsh growing conditions. Expect pepper and pine on the nose with buds that vary in appearance from light blue to purple.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†Secret Garden OG\n\nSecret Garden OG is a Colorado Seed Inc. masterpiece. This OG strain is incredibly relaxing and dedicated to Kush fans everywhere. The blend of Lavender parentage against a Ghost OG Moonshine x Rug Burn OG foretells the weight this strain applies to muscles throughout the body. With a unique aroma that leans toward the therapeutic, Secret Garden OG offers a cozy sense of well-being that extends to mood elevation and pain relief.\n\n¬†\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12002330/new-strains-alert-purple-people-eater-diamond-socks-bloos-kloos-a.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-purple-people-eater-diamond-socks-bloos-kloos-a"}],"reviewCount":15,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":131.25},{"name":"Pine","score":122.91666666666667},{"name":"Earthy","score":112.5},{"name":"Woody","score":112.5},{"name":"Pepper","score":104.16666666666667}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":131.25},{"name":"Sleepy","score":125},{"name":"Hungry","score":118.75},{"name":"Tingly","score":114.58333333333333},{"name":"Euphoric","score":45.833333333333329}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":114.58333333333333},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Stress","score":18.75},{"name":"Headaches","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":12.5}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":100},{"name":"Migraines","score":12.5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":127.08333333333333},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":114.58333333333333},{"name":"Dizzy","score":100}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/frisian-duck_100x100_5f22.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/646804/b/frisian-duck__primary_79b5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/frisian-duck_100x100_6bf1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/642801/b/frisian-duck__primary_8b75.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/frisian-duck_100x100_367a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/642893/b/frisian-duck__primary_ece5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/frisian-duck_100x100_c133.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/642923/b/frisian-duck__primary_d2a6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/frisian-duck_100x100_54b0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/638123/b/frisian-duck__primary_b4f3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/frisian-duck_100x100_3856.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/626515/b/frisian-duck__primary_96a7.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":21,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-duck","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.4/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Frisian Dew","subtitle":null,"slug":"frisian-dew","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew","symbol":"Fd","applink":"leafly://strain/frisian-dew"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
