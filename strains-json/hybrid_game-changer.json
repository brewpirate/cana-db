Some of you opted to share your laundry lists of strains consumed, with one Leafly fan rattling off 17 strains he tried last year (and they say cannabis consumers have poor memories). Others simply responded by naming their favorite strain, with Super Lemon Haze, White Rhino, Dr. Who, Jack Herer, Blue Dream, GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), Dutch Treat and many others cracking the list. \nOur favorite responses, however, were the strains that could truly summarize 2015. Without further ado…\n \nSkywalker\nThis indica-dominant hybrid basically sums up the last month of 2015, when Star Wars fever eclipsed the globe. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is the seventh film in the iconic series (fourth if, like most of us, you conveniently choose to forget that episodes 1-3 ever existed) and picks up about 30 years after the conclusion of \"Return of the Jedi.\" Since its release date on Dec. 18, the movie has made over $750 million domestically and $1.5 billion worldwide. The relaxing and happy Skywalker could be the perfect chaser to seeing the film, helping you drift off to sleep dreaming of galaxies far, far away.\n\n \nSnoop Dogg OG / Chong Star\n2015 was a big year for cannabis-positive celebrities, with several announcing their own line of cannabis products. Snoop Dogg and Tommy Chong are two cannabis veterans-turned-entrepreneurs, with Snoop launching Leafs by Snoop and Chong debuting pre-rolled cones. Naturally, both legends have their own strain, which is why we feel both Snoop Dogg OG and Chong Star exemplify last year\u0027s growing trend of celebrity product lines. \n\n \nTrainwreck\nWhether you attribute this hybrid to the madness known as the 2016 presidential election, the continuing implosion of celebrities like Justin Bieber and Shia LaBeouf, hot-button topics like gun control or Amy Schumer\u0027s hit comedy of the same name, Trainwreck is an apt description of 2015\u0027s many milestones. Considering the strain can deliver euphoric and happy effects, we\u0027ll go with the latter and suggest pairing it with an evening viewing of the summer hit that grossed over $110 million and introduced people to LeBron James\u0027 more humorous side. \n \nLiberty Haze\nSpeaking of the 2016 election, this past year had us all in a bit of a Liberty Haze, making us want to reach for this potent hybrid as we ponder the possibility of a Trump presidency. With so many candidates and an excruciatingly long election cycle, expect to see even more craziness in 2016 as we march towards the November election. One thing\u0027s for sure: Cannabis is shaping up to be a hot topic for the politicians. \n\n \nGame Changer\nIndeed, last year was a Game Changer for cannabis, with the introduction of the CARERS Act (even though it\u0027s now stalled in committee), the debut of recreational cannabis in Oregon, Canada\u0027s election of a cannabis-positive prime minister who intends to legalize cannabis nationwide, and many more milestones. This year is destined to be an even bigger one for the movement, with a number of states eyeing legalization. You better pick up some of this hybrid and buckle up for what\u0027s bound to be a wild ride for the industry this year.\n\n \nHonorable Mention: Rosin Tech\nOkay, so it\u0027s not technically a strain, but interest in rosin gained momentum in 2015 as cannabis consumers started to get concentrate-curious. Since rosin is a safer, DIY-version of solventless concentrate that can resemble shatter, people are reaching for their hair straighteners in an attempt to \"press\" their luck in making a batch of their own.\n\nWhich strain do you think best sums up 2015?

Worry not, there are plenty of other new varieties waiting!\n   1. Sensi Skunk\nCharacteristics of Sensi Skunk:\n\nSensi Skunk from Sensi Seeds is a potent Skunk #1 hybrid that offers a sweet and citrus flavor in contrast with the earthy, herbal aroma typical of Skunk varieties. The indica-driven effects produce a calm and euphoric buzz that relaxes tense muscles and alleviates stress. A great choice for indoor gardeners, Sensi Skunk boasts a short flowering cycle with heavy yields. Sensi Seeds has also released feminized and auto-flowering versions for those looking to streamline the cultivation process.\n\n   2. Dirty Girl\nCharacteristics of Dirty Girl:\n\nDirty Girl is a sativa-dominant cross of a Trainwreck hybrid, known as Arcata Lemon Wreck, and Cinderella 99. The combination produces a tropical aroma of pineapples, citrus, and fruit, with a sharp pungent note reminiscent of Pine Sol. The flavor of Dirty Girl is like sweet lemon candy and the effects it produces are happy and creative. Dirty Girl will elevate your mood and help avoid the complications of depression, anxiety, and migraines / headaches.\n\n   3. Game Changer\nCharacteristics of Game Changer:\n\nThe 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid Game Changer is a clone-only strain plausibly named for its ability to pivot bad moods, aches, and pains. It descends from California’s Purple Dragon and Thailand’s landrace sativa known as Green Thai, and this genetic fusion is evident in Game Changer’s twisting hues of vibrant green and deep purple. Floral notes sit quietly under a loud aroma of tropical fruit and grape in a show of this hybrid’s complex terpene profile. Whether it’s day or night, Game Changer offers unencumbered euphoria perfect for those looking to ease into the cannabis waters.\n\n   4. Blue Monster\nCharacteristics of Blue Monster:\n\nBlue Monster is a powerful combination of G13, Blueberry, Northern Lights #5, and a Mexican landrace strain. Bred by Goldenseed, Blue Monster combines a sweet mix of flavors with strong indica effects. Its complex aroma of berries and tropical fruits exposes the influence of Blueberry and G13 genetics. When grown to its full potential, the forceful relaxation of Blue Monster can overwhelm novices with its immediate body sedation and commanding cerebral effects. This monster indica is sure to scare away sleepless nights and body pains.\n\n   5. White Diesel\nCharacteristics of White Diesel:\n\nWhite Diesel is a sativa-dominant hybrid that mixes the resinous White Widow with the pungent flavors of NYC Diesel. The buds from White Diesel produce a zesty combination of lemon, grapefruit, and the diesel fumes that we’ve come to expect from Sour Diesel varieties. The effects are a well-rounded mix of an uplifting sativa head buzz with mellow body relaxation. Medical patients enjoy White Diesel’s ability to ward off anxiety and depression, and for combating migraines and gastrointestinal disorders.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002351/new-strains-alert-sensi-skunk-dirty-girl-game-changer-blue-monste.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-sensi-skunk-dirty-girl-game-changer-blue-monste"}],"reviewCount":99,"flavors":[{"name":"Grape","score":14.264264264264263},{"name":"Earthy","score":14.264264264264263},{"name":"Berry","score":8.033033033033032},{"name":"Sweet","score":6.8318318318318321},{"name":"Apple","score":5.7807807807807805}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":56.261261261261261},{"name":"Happy","score":47.552552552552555},{"name":"Uplifted","score":44.549549549549546},{"name":"Creative","score":34.93993993993994},{"name":"Sleepy","score":34.489489489489486}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":36.066066066066064},{"name":"Depression","score":30.510510510510514},{"name":"Pain","score":30.06006006006006},{"name":"Fatigue","score":27.807807807807809},{"name":"Headaches","score":8.4834834834834822}],"conditions":[{"name":"PTSD","score":44.8048048048048},{"name":"Anxiety","score":28.933933933933936},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":21.351351351351351},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":2.4774774774774775},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.5765765765765765}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":29.684684684684683},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":28.033033033033036},{"name":"Dizzy","score":6.9069069069069062},{"name":"Anxious","score":3.9039039039039038},{"name":"Headache","score":3.228228228228228}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/game-changer_100x100_04c8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/598521/b/game-changer__primary_673c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/game-changer_100x100_56e7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/598839/b/game-changer__primary_3a63.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/game-changer_100x100_1929.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/540635/b/game-changer__primary_54e5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/game-changer_100x100_d6dc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/535345/b/game-changer__primary_ffaa.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/game-changer_100x100_ed23.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/520884/b/game-changer__primary_c46b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/game-changer_100x100_1e11.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/516812/b/game-changer__primary_fa9a.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":31,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Eugene, OR","Salem, OR","Beaverton, OR","Ashland, OR","Bend, OR","Grants Pass, OR","Gresham, OR","Medford, OR","San Francisco, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/game-changer","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.50505050505051/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Purple Dragon","subtitle":null,"slug":"purple-dragon","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/purple-dragon","symbol":"Pdd","applink":"leafly://strain/purple-dragon"},{"name":"Thai","subtitle":null,"slug":"thai","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/thai","symbol":"Tha","applink":"leafly://strain/thai"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":43,"outdoorFinish":"End of October","height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tTopping may be necessary to manage height indoors\n\n"}}
