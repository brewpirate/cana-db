I was told it was bred in the Northern California area.  The strain however was overwhelmingly sedative for me and my girlfriend, we found it more effective than most pure indicas for insomnia relief.  Haven\u0027t seen it down here in LA much, but when I did it was my go-to sleeping strain.  Gotta rate it highly for the complexity of the breeding and the aesthetic uniqueness (whoever bred this has skills), but the Lavender and Northern Lights are very prevalent in this hybrid and just knocked me and my GF straight into dreamland - there was no degree of stimulation physically or mentally.  I would say this is a marvelous indica-dominant hybrid, but it is the opposite of a daytime medication.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1498182,"username":"melody120","text":"So great for anxiety and depression, yet still functioning normally.
