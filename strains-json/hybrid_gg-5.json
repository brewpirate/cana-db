Very cerebral and a strong sense of time and space distortion. I find that usually after smoking GG#5 I'm laying on the couch on my phone looking up information or documentaries. Makes you mentally alert in a way but physically truly (gorilla) glued and couch locked. Great for pain and sleep, also very good for when you're feeling down. This one will always be on my top #5.",
