    "description": "<p>Ginger Punch (formerly Hobbit) by Kannabia Seed Company&nbsp;is a resilient autoflowering variety with sweetness and strong elemental resistance. This strain has a sweet aroma that has been described as &ldquo;strawberry candy&rdquo; and an equally sweet smoke with latent earthy notes. Ginger Punch&nbsp;deftly combines stimulating Haze elements with a pervasive body buzz that is lightly weighted while remaining pleasant and functional. Many growers covet this autoflowering wonder for its quick 65-day flowering time and above-average yield. &nbsp;</p>\n",
