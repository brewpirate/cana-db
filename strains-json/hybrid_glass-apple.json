I got a joint and this is a great day time strain. I am a lot more energetic \u0026 happy. \"uplifting\" is the word I\u0027m looking for. As we speak I am high af and can function very well. I actually don\u0027t mind small talk with my customers. \n\nI don\u0027t recommend smoking this at night if you\u0027re trying to get some sleep. It is definitely a more adventurous type of smoke. Unless you like to go to the woods at night, that would be dope. \n\n10/10 would smoke again.
