I am a lot more energetic & happy. \"uplifting\" is the word I'm looking for. As we speak I am high af and can function very well. I actually don't mind small talk with my customers. \n\nI don't recommend smoking this at night if you're trying to get some sleep. It is definitely a more adventurous type of smoke. Unless you like to go to the woods at night, that would be dope. \n\n10/10 would smoke again. ",
