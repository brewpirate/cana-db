It\u0027s crazy how different strains can cause our body\u0027s to react in different ways. For me this is the best strain I have tried, which fits all my needs. I have always been a Sativa guy. Love my daytime hi. My lady, whom runs a very large, successful business would never smoke with me, because it either knocked her out or made her paranoid. She is in her 50\u0027s. however the first time I tried Glass Slipper I knew, I knew this was the one. It gave her energy, focus, took away the stress, and pain every person her age has. We are always on the go, always. I was soo glad I tried this. I have been in the Marijuana industry for a good bit now. You cannot go wrong with this strain, I promise u. I was sitting there wondering while smoking this,  how could my head get any clearer. If I had to list some or any downside. As I would hav to nit pick,  The only downside I have found...is Dry Mouth, and Time seems to pass very slow on this strain. No matter what I have here with me. At the moment I have Alaskan Thunderfuck, Bruce Banner, Trainwreck, and Grape Stomper. No matter what I hav on hand, I still choose this over them all. Never a bad hi. Just lots of very good energy and vibes and the most clear head u will ever have. A few others on my list would be...White 99, Flo, and Green Crack. So if you are wanting a couch lock feel, this is not the strain for you. If u want to be able to be hi as hell..yet still function, be stress free, pain free, have ADHD, PTSD be relived, then this helps tremendously with all of it. It\u0027s also a very good arousel strain. Good for older couples whom think maybe they can\u0027t still get aroused. This strain will fix those people sex lives in a hurry. So you could smoke a blunt, be soo hi, yet still walk into the bank and spit out your account number right off the top of your head and even surprise yourself...if you are looking for any of those I memtioned, then Glass Slipper is for you All Day.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/ZtQxS6XT_MjOwMadRkRsU9ZNU-I=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fX2q7eTOS7WxMAnwrLSBM_wide-brim-green.png"},{"id":1640463,"username":"MyJokerHandStayLIT","text":"1 Puff of CO2 Cart- Happy , Chill , want to laugh and giggly and feeling more creative my mind is alive.
