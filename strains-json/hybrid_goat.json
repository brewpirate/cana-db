            "text": "My friends, we made it. The long-awaited weekend is here. But two pressing questions remain: How are you going to spend the weekend and which Washington state cannabis products are going to make it the best ever?\nThe Leafly team (and our industry friends) got together to discuss what our favorites are and how they\u2019ll be enhancing our weekend. Whether you\u2019re planning to kick back at home or get outside (rain or shine), let us help you branch out so you don\u2019t have to take a shot in the dark at some new strains, products, and brands.\nBrowse the Latest Cannabis Products\nFor Your Weekend Gaming Binge\n\u00a0\nProduct: GaGa Peanut Butter Cups\u00a0(10mg) \nType: Edible\n\u201cI got myself a Nintendo Switch and the new Zelda game this weekend, and I wanted an edible that would basically cryogenically freeze me to my couch, rendering me unaware of my physical form and immerse me fully in the lush grassy fields of Hyrule. These peanut butter cups by GaGa did just that. I was utterly and completely stoned into oblivion for six to eight hours. The filling tasted more like cannabis than peanut butter, but the experience is what matters most to me.\u201d \u2013 Bailey, Leafly Editor\nProduct: The Clear\u2019s Golden Goat\nType: Vape Pen Cartridge\n\u201cThe Clear\u2019s Golden Goat vape pen from Fweedom Collective tastes fantastic and you don\u2019t have to hit it as often to get super high \u2013 meaning more time for my hands to be on the controller while playing Zelda in bed.\u201d \u2013 Fermin, Leafly Developer\n\nFor Spring Cleaning\n\nProduct: Headlight\u2019s Moon Cookies\nType: High-THC Flower, Hybrid\n\u201cI tried Moon Cookies flower by Headlight over the weekend. A few puffs in had me motivated to do all the dishes in the sink! A few more puffs and I was motivated to meal plan for the week. I did both and felt happy about it. Moon Cookies: Get your life on track.\u201d \u2013 Diana, Leafly Customer Service Specialist\nProduct: Errl\u2019s Dutch Treat\nType: Dabbable Oil\n\u201cDutch Treat is a must-have sativa-dominant hybrid for concentrate consumers seeking quality terpenes and functional effects. Errl\u2019s Dutch Treat is sweet and pungent, leaving the hallmark \u2018dutchy\u2019 flavor spread across the palate. The moderate energy and uplifted mental state make it a perfect companion for cleaning the house, finishing chores, or kicking off the day.\u201d \u2013 Jeremiah, Leafly Strain Researcher\n\nFor Fueling Creativity\n\nProduct: Puffin Farm\u2019s Dancehall\nType: High-CBD Flower, Sativa\n\u201cI recommend Puffin Farm\u2019s Dancehall for playing or listening to music. It\u2019s called Dancehall for a reason. It makes it so easy to lock in to the sounds, but since it\u2019s barely got any THC in it, you can stay sharp and remember how your cymbal stand works before you play.\u201c \u2013 Saba, Leafly Software Engineer\nProduct: Private Reserve\u2019s Pink Cookies\nType: High-THC Flower, Hybrid\n\u201cWhether I\u2019m making jewelry, coloring in my adult coloring books, or cutting up pictures for a collage, I\u2019ve found that cannabis always boosts my creativity and makes the activity that much more enjoyable. I tend to prefer hybrids while crafting, since straight sativas can make me anxious. A budtender at Trees Pot Shop recommended a lovely strain, Pink Cookies from Private Reserve, a delightful combination of GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) and Cherry Pie (already two of my favorite hybrids), and it\u2019s the perfect blend for relaxation and concentration. I can focus on my crafting with a soothing calmness that envelops you like a happy hug.\u201d \u2013 Lisa, Leafly Editor\n\nFor Health & Wellness\n\nProduct: Ethos CBD Tincture (250mg/bottle)\nType: Tincture \n\u201cA dropper of this tincture is good with a cup of coffee to curb anxiety before work, at the end of the day to help relax the body before bed, the morning after a party to help with a hangover, or any time you are seeking general anti-inflammatory effects that won\u2019t mess with your head.\u201d \u2013 Jeremiah, Leafly Strain Researcher\nProduct: Craft Elixirs Ginger Grass Syrup (60mg THC/bottle)\nType: Infused Syrup\n\u201cI recently tried Craft Elixir\u2019s ginger flavored syrup since they were out of my favorite simple syrup. I think I accidentally found a new favorite. The combination of ginger and THC calms my perma-fussy stomach really well. I can dissolve a micro-dose (<5mg) of the elixir in some hot water and sip it for mild nausea and anxiety relief \u2013 all without a detectable high.\u201d \u2013 Bailey, Leafly Editor\n\nFor Hiking, Exercise, and Getting Out\u00a0\nProduct: The Rig Stick\nType: Portable Dab Pen\n\u201cI\u2019m really impressed by The Rig Stick. In my opinion, it\u2019s a way easier method of dabbing on-the-go than a Nectar Collector or small rig. It requires no water but it doesn\u2019t taste or feel like doing a dry dab at all!\u201d \u2013 Randi, Budtender\nProduct: Pioneer Nuggets\u2019 Lodi Dodi\nType: High-THC Flower, Hybrid\n\u201cLodi Dodi by Pioneer Nuggets is my go-to workout strain. A bowl or two before suiting up, and by the time I hit the treadmill my limbs are buzzing with a complementary physical energy. Lodi Dodi adequately hazes my mind alongside these lightening physical effects, allowing the music to transport me into \u2018The Zone.\u2019 This strain makes the repetition of running in place significantly more enjoyable, and its physical effects seem to improve my overall endurance.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Jeremiah, Leafly Strain Researcher\nProduct: Headlight\u2019s GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4) \nType: Vape Pen Cartridge\n\u201cHeadlight\u2019s GG (f.k.a. Gorilla Glue) vape cartridge is great for a busy weekend. Simple and potent dosing make it easy to dial in your effects and its flavor profile stays true to the flower. A couple puffs create an uplifting, focused buzz, perfect before a workout. The pungent, piney flavors will draw you back, and after a few more puffs it\u2019s time to curl up with a good book or the latest episodes of Planet Earth.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Will, Leafly Digital Content Producer\n\nWhat\u2019s the weekend have in store for you?

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: The sativa-dominant Golden Goat gives an energetic, cerebral high that can be intimidating for new users. It\u2019s a clone-only strain that was accidentally produced by crossing Hawaiian Romulan with Island Sweet Skunk. A popular strain in Colorado, Golden Goat is best known for its strong fruity smell and high THC content.\nGrow Techniques: Grow this plant with lots of space for the roots, as they like to stretch and grow big. Golden Goat is a branchy plant, making it ideal for a SOG (sea of green) if you put in the time to train the plant. If growing indoors, allow for stretch.\nFlowering Time: 9-10 weeks\nYield: Moderate\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Prefers warm temperatures between 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit\nIndoor/Outdoor: In a warm climate, grow Golden Goat outdoors in a big pot to see the plant truly take off. When growing indoors, be sure to give your plants plenty of space.\nFeeding: Moderate feeding should be adequate. Bud development can be kicked into full gear toward the end of the season by allowing for cooler temperatures and letting the roots receive plenty of oxygen.",
