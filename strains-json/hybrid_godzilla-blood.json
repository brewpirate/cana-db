    "description": "<p>Godzilla Blood by Pua Mana 1st Hawaiian Pakalolo Seed Bank is a combination of rare Hawaiian genetics and the ever-potent, GG4. It was created by crossing Godzilla Glue (<a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-glue-4\">GG4</a> x <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kona-gold\">Kona Gold</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/the-blood\">The Blood</a> BX2, which is known for its outstanding potency. This strain emits a deep aroma of tropical earth intermixed with spicy, hashy notes. The flavor is sweet and hashy with touches of pungent chemical on the exhale. Godzilla Glue produces especially resinous buds that make it ideal for extraction and high-tolerance consumers looking to up their cannabinoid content.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n",

I have a very high (No pun intended) tolerance, so it may not be a \"before work smoke\" for all. Very good nighttime smoke though. Guaranteed to make you go see what you've got to munch on.
