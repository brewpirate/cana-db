            "text": "I got this strain from ECC in central CA. SB to be exact.  I liked it.  Very woodsy, earthy bouquet.  Lighter green in color than expected but had yellow-ish hairs.  The combination of the two colors play off each other to give off a 'glowing neon' look.  Great bag appeal.\n\nI'd have to say the only remarkable characteristic of this flower was its appearance. Other than that, I feel it's a middle of the road strain.  Heady onset that makes you think it might be a heavy body creeper and you wait and wait..  nothing happens.  The head fuzz wears off far too soon.  I was hoping for a great adversary to GG#4 or Elmer's Glue, but didn't find many similarities.  \n\nI'm giving it four stars because it was very affordable, but you'd be happier getting something else.",
