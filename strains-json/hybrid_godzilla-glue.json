SB to be exact.  I liked it.  Very woodsy, earthy bouquet.  Lighter green in color than expected but had yellow-ish hairs.  The combination of the two colors play off each other to give off a \u0027glowing neon\u0027 look.  Great bag appeal.\n\nI\u0027d have to say the only remarkable characteristic of this flower was its appearance. Other than that, I feel it\u0027s a middle of the road strain.  Heady onset that makes you think it might be a heavy body creeper and you wait and wait..  nothing happens.  The head fuzz wears off far too soon.  I was hoping for a great adversary to GG#4 or Elmer\u0027s Glue, but didn\u0027t find many similarities.  \n\nI\u0027m giving it four stars because it was very affordable, but you\u0027d be happier getting something else.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1625322,"username":"BeenBlowinOG","text":"This strain is straight fire üî• I picked this up because 1 I haven\u0027t heard of this strain yet, and 2 I am a huge fan of the GG#4.
