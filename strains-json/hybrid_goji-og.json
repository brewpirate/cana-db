            "text": "It\u2019s been a busy week in Avid Dabber-land! Last week was a whirlwind of excessive coffee drinking, food truck gluttony, and rubbing elbows with some of the best growers and extractors from Oregon. I got to hang with a bunch of awesome people and enjoy some of Portland\u2019s culinary scene, but most importantly, I got to experience some of the finest flower and hash available in the state.\nLast time I shared some of the temperature ranges I prefer when dabbing. This week, I wanted to show a little love for my Nectar Collector. If you\u2019ve never seen or used a Nectar Collector, it is tool with an inventive approach to dabbing. I love the simplicity and portability, and how self-contained a Nectar Collector makes the dabbing experience. It\u2019s always met with some degree of awe and wonder whenever I bust it out in front of someone who hasn\u2019t had a chance to dab with one before.\nBrowse Dab & Oil Rigs\n\n\n\n\n\n How did you feel about dabs from the #nectarcollector? I love the simplicity, portability, and how contained it keeps the dabbing experience. \ud83d\udc1d\ud83c\udf6f . . . #aviddabber #Seattle #leafly #onlydabthebest #onlythebest #onlysmokethebest #dab #dabs #cannabis #dabbing #dablife #dabstagram #shatter #dailydabbers #dabbersdaily #bho #sho #weshouldsmoke #highsociety #stayhigh #concentrates #710 #420 #710community\nA post shared by  The Avid Dabber (@the.avid.dabber) on Feb 6, 2018 at 12:53pm PST\n\n\n\nWhat Makes a Nectar Collector Different?\nWhen I introduce someone to the Nectar Collector, there\u2019s usually a moment of confusion as they try to figure out how this long, glass device is used. Simply put, it\u2019s a \u201cpercolating dab straw.\u201d Like a standard dab rig, Nectar Collectors are designed to vaporize hash and concentrates. They are portable and use a dish to help avoid some of the mess of tooling your dab when on the go. And of course, what\u2019s a dab without proper percolation? A Nectar Collector offers water-filtration typical of the common dab rig, but in a spill-proof design.\n\nHow Does a Nectar Collector Work?\nWhat makes the Nectar Collector\u2019s functionality so unique is that instead of applying a dab to the surface of a nail or banger, you apply the hot tip to a small pile of hash in your dish.\nTo prepare your dab, you can load just about any amount of hash in the serving dish. When I take my Nectar Collector on camping trips, I\u2019ll drop the whole gram in the dish and have dabs on deck for the entire weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n Starting my week off on the hot tip\u2026 just like my #nectarcollector Hope everyone has a great week! . . . #aviddabber #Seattle #leafly #onlydabthebest #onlythebest #onlysmokethebest #dab #dabs #cannabis #dabbing #dablife #dabstagram #shatter #dailydabbers #dabbersdaily #bho #sho #weshouldsmoke #highsociety #stayhigh #concentrates #710 #420 #710community #glassofig \ud83d\udcf7 @juliasumpter\nA post shared by  The Avid Dabber (@the.avid.dabber) on Jan 29, 2018 at 11:29am PST\n\n\n\nWith your hash is sitting in the serving dish,\u00a0heat the tip of the Nectar Collector just like you would with a standard nail or banger. With the tip of the Nectar Collector red hot, give it about a minute to cool down before you take your dab. Most Nectar Collectors will come with a quartz tip, a titanium tip, or both. I prefer the quartz tip, but the titanium tip offers more durability since it is less susceptible to breaking if it drops out.\nOnce the tip has cooled to your preferred temperature, tap the hot tip along your pile of concentrate sitting in the dish. Take note, the longer you hold the tip against the hash, the larger your dab will be. I\u2019ve found the best way to control the size of your dab is to repeatedly tap your Nectar Collector until you\u2019ve pulled enough vapor through.\nFrom there, the vapor will travel up through the Nectar Collector, percolating through the water chamber until it meets you at the mouth piece.

Pro tip: You can use a keck clip to help keep your glass attachments secure.\nLong and unwieldy \u2013 The long shape can be a bit awkward and cumbersome, especially when passing around a Nectar Collector with a red-hot tip.\nLack of temperature control \u2013 While you can find e-nail adapters and heater coils that work with a Nectar Collector, the traditional heat and cool method doesn\u2019t offer the same standardization as a typical quartz banger. It will take some trail and error to find the sweet spot and manage the temperature fluctuation.\nExplore Dabbing Tools & Accessories\nAvid Dab of the Week\n\n\n\n\n\n Sunday morning dabs\u2026 #goji flower rosin I pressed from @ftsfarms flower.

After pressing and collecting the rosin, I left it to cure for 48 hours, allowing it to butter up into a creamy, opaque consistency. The flavor is a mix of earthy pine and subtle hints of berry sweetness on the exhale.\nHave you dabbed with a Nectar Collector?

I lost my lighter for 2 hours ... did the same steps 20 times, couldn't find it.   Smoked this stuff and within 15 seconds, did another look at how I was doing the steps and found the lighter, no lie - \"Like of course it would be there\".   \n\nLet the feeding time begin - you'll be wanting to eat right away after smoking this.  Another time I was smoking this, I ended up baking chocolate chip cookies, and that's very productive for me!   \n\nYou will like dancing and moving around. You'll be so awake, you'll be creative, you'll be lovin life.  Listening to Dave Rawlings Machine.  This is probably the best day-time medicine you could get.\n\nCon:  No side effects at all - but it's not long-lasting.  After 2-3 hours, it's like you didn't do much.\n\nWhen: When some idiot wants to talk about Republican ideas and their candidates  \n\nWarn:  When I smoke 1 or 2 - it's awesome.  When I do  like 4, it's a hard hard high - one that is too strong and I actually dislike it.  But, love it when I do 1 or 2 hits.    It does have some Indica in there so you are neither tired or awake - it's very in between - but not so much you want to sleep.",
