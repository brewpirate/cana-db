The lemon aroma is instantly noticed with a strong citrus onset, almost diesel-like.  Leave this beast in a jar or sealed because she can spread quick and heavy!  I would suggest vaping this strain to pull out the most flavor.  You will be hit with the lemon and followed up by the citrus rush.  The effects have a rapid onset (less than 5 minutes) with a very euphoric and relaxed mix.  I felt the tinglyness up near the forehead and through my legs for a deep relaxation!  Highly recommended for those with anxiety as this puts you in a great mood! \n\n ~~HIGHLY RECOMMENDED~~","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"},{"id":1639668,"username":"jonBlaze777","text":"Pretty dank.
