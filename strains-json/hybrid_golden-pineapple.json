Jean Guy\nA fan favorite from our neighbors to the North (Canada, eh?), Jean Guy (pronounced “Jawn Gee”) is a sativa-dominant strain known for its high THC content and energizing effects. A great one to start your day cramp-free.\n 2. Hog\u0027s Breath\nHog’s Breath is a well-known indica with roots in the Kush landrace and is known for its potency against heavy pain and anxiety – a good strain to relax after a long work day.\n 3. Medicine Man\nMedicine Man lives up to its name by delivering potent pain relief with high levels of both THC and CBD. This medicinal strain is closely related to the master of the indica jungle – White Rhino.\n 4. Hash Plant\nHash Plant is known for an abundance of trichomes and a heavy body stone. This indica has a reputation for blissful euphoria, as well as easing pain and inflammation associated with Crohn’s and Colitis.\n 5. Willie Nelson\nWillie Nelson is named for the Red-Headed Stranger himself. This sativa offers a clear-headed, energetic high known to incite creativity, as well as a decent case of the munchies. \n 6. Chemo\nChemo is just as sedative as you might imagine – a heavy body high that’s perfect for chronic pain. Take note: the munchies are strong with this one. If you have stomach cramps or trouble eating, this strain will inspire your appetite.\n 7. Lemon Jack\nLemon Jack is born of the famed Jack Herer and Lemon Kush and offers strong psychoactive effects. Lemon Jack is a daytime strain as strong as a cup of coffee, but without the harsh stomach irritation. Recommended for users who suffer from fatigue.\n 8. Golden Pineapple\nGolden Pineapple is as delightful as it sounds. A hybrid cross that delivers uplifting, creative effects with a delicious fruity taste, it offers relief from stress and anxiety without causing fatigue.\n 9. Confidential Cheese\nConfidential Cheese is born of the legendary LA Confidential and Exodus Cheese. It offers powerful pain relief, as well as relief from insomnia. Great for winding down before bedtime, Confidential Cheese also subdues painful muscle spasms and cramps.\n 10. K2\nK2 is named for the world’s second highest mountain peak, which makes sense, as it comes from two of the greats – White Widow and Hindu Kush. K2 is known to increase appetite and calm nausea without any sedative sleepy effects, making it a great strain for both daytime and evening use.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002927/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis"}],"reviewCount":358,"flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple","score":66.345832967418986},{"name":"Sweet","score":46.400866485173147},{"name":"Tropical","score":29.402095957378297},{"name":"Citrus","score":22.6113843271567},{"name":"Vanilla","score":6.666666666666667}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":81.470609759667468},{"name":"Uplifted","score":47.6466584701853},{"name":"Focused","score":44.68941190246187},{"name":"Energetic","score":42.63216826205322},{"name":"Relaxed","score":42.367612189338715}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":33.504361699013494},{"name":"Pain","score":19.167764409706979},{"name":"Fatigue","score":18.320306782588332},{"name":"Depression","score":17.763677878282252},{"name":"Headaches","score":7.3515851409502071}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":15.879950821111795},{"name":"PTSD","score":7.8806972863792044},{"name":"Cancer","score":3.7136647053657676},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":3.2548081145165542},{"name":"PMS","score":2.9309739176253626}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":22.811173560492961},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":14.865709434735518},{"name":"Headache","score":2.8662070782471241},{"name":"Dizzy","score":2.3425836480196716},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.277816808641433}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/golden-pineapple_100x100_874e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/645135/b/golden-pineapple__primary_409f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/golden-pineapple_100x100_7612.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/613867/b/golden-pineapple__primary_cd44.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/golden-pineapple_100x100_9675.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/564982/b/golden-pineapple__primary_3de2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/golden-pineapple_100x100_ab74.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/551199/b/golden-pineapple__primary_c071.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/golden-pineapple_100x100_e1c5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522937/b/golden-pineapple__primary_de42.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/golden-pineapple_100x100_b876.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522607/b/golden-pineapple__primary_4e5c.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":44,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Seattle, WA","Denver, CO","Eugene, OR","Everett, WA","Bellingham, WA","Lynnwood, WA","Shoreline, WA","Beaverton, OR","Bremerton, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-pineapple","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.55307262569832/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Golden Goat","subtitle":null,"slug":"golden-goat","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-goat","symbol":"Gdg","applink":"leafly://strain/golden-goat"},{"name":"Pineapple Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"pineapple-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-kush","symbol":"Pak","applink":"leafly://strain/pineapple-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Jean Guy\nA fan favorite from our neighbors to the North (Canada, eh?), Jean Guy (pronounced “Jawn Gee”) is a sativa-dominant strain known for its high THC content and energizing effects. A great one to start your day cramp-free.\n 2. Hog\u0027s Breath\nHog’s Breath is a well-known indica with roots in the Kush landrace and is known for its potency against heavy pain and anxiety – a good strain to relax after a long work day.\n 3. Medicine Man\nMedicine Man lives up to its name by delivering potent pain relief with high levels of both THC and CBD. This medicinal strain is closely related to the master of the indica jungle – White Rhino.\n 4. Hash Plant\nHash Plant is known for an abundance of trichomes and a heavy body stone. This indica has a reputation for blissful euphoria, as well as easing pain and inflammation associated with Crohn’s and Colitis.\n 5. Willie Nelson\nWillie Nelson is named for the Red-Headed Stranger himself. This sativa offers a clear-headed, energetic high known to incite creativity, as well as a decent case of the munchies. \n 6. Chemo\nChemo is just as sedative as you might imagine – a heavy body high that’s perfect for chronic pain. Take note: the munchies are strong with this one. If you have stomach cramps or trouble eating, this strain will inspire your appetite.\n 7. Lemon Jack\nLemon Jack is born of the famed Jack Herer and Lemon Kush and offers strong psychoactive effects. Lemon Jack is a daytime strain as strong as a cup of coffee, but without the harsh stomach irritation. Recommended for users who suffer from fatigue.\n 8. Golden Pineapple\nGolden Pineapple is as delightful as it sounds. A hybrid cross that delivers uplifting, creative effects with a delicious fruity taste, it offers relief from stress and anxiety without causing fatigue.\n 9.

And just as rosé is the perfect summer sipper, these 10 strains might as well have been bred expressly for summer fun with friends, whether out in the sun or under the stars.\nFrom sweet, citrusy sativas to sticky, sunset-hued hybrids, don’t miss a single one of the following cannabis strains this season.\n\nSchrom | Sativa\n \nAroma and flavor | Lemon-limey as a soda pop with extra squeezes of fresh-sliced citrus.\nExperience | Frequently tricky to hunt down, this 70% sativa delivers a breezy, buoyant, clear-headed elevation that’s completely worth the search. An axiom frequently uttered around the Leafly office: “Schrom is bomb.”\nWhat you need it for | Chilling on the back patio with your favorite people.\nIntake | Bong, with an ice pinch.\nGolden Pineapple | Hybrid\n \nAroma and flavor | Pineapple upside-down cake, fresh out of the oven, two inches from your nose. Somewhere nearby, a fruit basket overflows with papayas, ripe bananas, and mangoes.\nExperience | Gp is liquid sunshine, in the form of unadulterated happiness. You’ll want to dance, hum, and hug someone.\nWhat you need it for | Your friend’s backyard barbecue; pair it with a couple of teriyaki kebabs.\nIntake | Vaporizer that supports dry herb.\nRed-Headed Stranger | Sativa\n \nAroma and flavor | Subtly spicy, tangy and herbal.\nExperience | Zippy, jazzy, energetic.\nWhat you need it for | Day hike motivation. The view from the top of that mountain is going to look better than ever.\nIntake | Pipe, tincture, or baked into an edible.\nSunset Sherbet | Hybrid\n \nAroma and flavor | Sweetness underscores berry flavors on the inhale, then jumps out to steal the whole show on the exhale.\nExperience | GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) may be legendary, but Sunset Sherbet is its heir apparent. The hybrid builds on Gsc’s all-star ancestry (grandparents: Cherry Pie, OG Kush, and Durban Poison), and weaves in a few indica-dominant characteristics all its own.\nWhat you need it for | A sandy beach at – you guessed it – sunset.\nIntake | Joint.\nIngrid | Indica\n \nAroma and flavor | Sweet, skunky, earthy.\nExperience | Not all indicas are made for summer, but Ingrid is the free-wheeling hippie kid who got cool in college, came home over summer vacation, and knocked everyone’s socks off. Side effects include a desire to snuggle up in a hammock and smile around at everyone and everything.\nWhat you need it for | Your next lakeside campout; break out a jar once you’ve settled by the campfire for the evening.\nIntake | Pipe.\nTangie | Sativa\n \nAroma and flavor | A tangerine dream come true. If aromas could drip citrus juice, this one would.\nExperience | Slow and shy to come on at first, Tg’s high tends to hit as soon as you look the other way. It’s a tingly rush of cool, creative energy, and you’re going to want to get up and do stuff.\nWhat you need it for | You know how you’ve been meaning to tackle that art project? Get on it.\nIntake | Concentrate; a li’l dab’ll do ya for the afternoon.\nSuper Silver Haze | Sativa\n \nAroma and flavor | Earthy with hints of pine, like gardening in an evergreen forest.\nExperience | With numerous coveted first-place awards, Ss is one of the most decorated strains out there, and its energetic, euphoric high is among the most classic. It’s a solid strain year-round, but its effects shine brightest from July through September.\nWhat you need it for | Your Labor Day backpacking trip.\nIntake | Pre-roll; no need to get fancy.\nJillybean | Hybrid\n \nAroma and flavor | Orange candy meets a creamsicle in a fruity, delicious flavor-splosion.\nExperience | Chatty and cheerful for hours on end.\nWhat you need it for | Sitting on your front porch (preferably on a porch swing) with a glass of iced tea in one hand.\nIntake | Time-to-time tokes off your concentrate pen.\nMercury OG | Indica\n \nAroma and flavor | Mer expresses a complex array of gorgeous floral characteristics; you’ll have a hard time taking your nose out of the jar long enough to load a bowl.\nExperience | Get ready to relax, breathe easy, and relish a deeply pleasurable body high.\nWhat you need it for | Your family vacation.\nIntake | Bong or dab rig – go for a big hit.\nPurple Trainwreck | Hybrid\n \nAroma and flavor | Think fragrant California wine grapes, freshly picked and about to be pressed.\nExperience | This bold yet balanced hybrid heightens everything you love about summer.
