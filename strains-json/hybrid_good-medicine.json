Tree of Life\n\nTree of Life is a unique hybrid cross between Trainwreck and Mendocino Purps, created by Oregon OMMP growers in the late 2000s. It\u2019s known to provide calming euphoria and an uplifting boost of creativity. With a vigorous sativa-dominant growth pattern, Tree of Life produces fully ripened buds with a rich palate of creamy orange zest and lemon balm. An early flowerer, Tree of Life will finish its maturation cycle by the third week of September outdoors. When consumed, Tree of Life has a pleasant taste reminiscent of sandalwood incense.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Tree of Life\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.

Bred for potency as well as flavor, Qush\u2019s resin-packed buds radiate with sweet aromas of grape, cherry, and hashy spice. This tranquilizing strain has a way of calming worries and upset stomachs, but keep in mind that Qush can have a sedating, cloudy effect on the mind so consider saving this one for evenings and lazy days.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Qush\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Alien Inferno\n\nUsing a White Fire #6 and Alien OG hybrid and crossing it again with Diablo, LivWell created Alien Inferno.

            "text": "As a 100% disabled combat vet with PTSD, I LOVE this strain.  It is difficult to find a strain that can relieve some of the anxiety and hyper-vigilance, encourage relaxation, while allowing me to get things done.  The higher the THC level, especially in Sativas, the worse the anxiety for me.  This strain has a much lower THC level with a high amount of CBD which accomplishes my goals mentioned above.  This is my staple strain.  I can consume it during the day and still get done what I need to get done.  I couple this strain with a nice Indica at night so I can sleep.  I recommend it highly to my veteran brothers and sisters with both the visible and invisible wounds of war.  HOPE4PTSDVETS.ORG",

            "text": "Set up the Good Medicine and felt smoke so light that it seemed I fucked it up. However once I got the airy taste in, I figured I'd start small with one hit. Took it 6:30 pm after depression spiraled me down from on-edge to 'can't do daily life'.  So... a bit of a head-throb effect so far in terms of a head rush. By 7, felt receptive to everything around me and more interested in observing it, did dishes which this am at therapy I'd said I'd probably put off for another week, and background thoughts quiet. Feeling more energetic/enthusiastic/easier to act upon things to do when looking at them (ie: cleaning counters). Time seemed to fly by from then on, since I was working on repairing my sewing machine. I was slower in following written directions but maintained understanding and clarity. Had a few stray bad thoughts (counted 3-4ish) and they came/went very easily, though on the hit's cooldown at 11:40 pm, one stray bad thought caused a panic reaction that only lasted a second or so.\n\n\n---Good Medicine, CBD: 6.94%, THC: 4.01%, CBG: 0.25%, beta-myrcene: 1.25%, alpha-pinene: 0.78%, d-limonene:0.16%, beta-caryophyllene: ___\n\nEffects: more reciprocative, energetic, a bit 'sped up', thinking is clear and at a regular pace, background fuzz is silent, depressing thoughts/trauma memories are more uncommon but extremely easy to dismiss whereas before they'd stick, easier to get things done as sight-to-doing process registers more immediately. No munchies.\n\nCons: Slight head-woozy effect on kicking in. Does NOT stop negativity/bad thoughts from leeching in but seems to make them less numerous. Good strain for morning or early afternoon. Does not cause increased feeling of euphoria or happiness. Mood only elevated slightly over neutral very briefly.",
