As soon as you see this, especially by Elev8 get it asap, you will be so damn happy it won\u0027t even be funny. I\u0027ve had it about 3 times so far always over 87% THC alone. This stuff smells and tastes so good it stomps on Girl Scout Cookies in my opinion, but that\u0027s my opinion. I found it best for Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, Pain \u0026 Spasms. This is a A++++++ concentrate strain.

The aroma is quite unique, almost minty but with the pungency characteristic of Gorilla Glue, and can be tasted during consumption. I\u0027m not the biggest fan of Gorilla Glue\u0027s heavily sedating effects, but this strain is just the right blend of the parental lineages. The nugs are impressively sized, sticky and dense, caked with crystals and short, dark orange hairs. The high will leave you couchlocked for hours watching videos of spiders on youtube- and absolutely entranced the entire time. Great strain for vegetating or knocking yourself out after a long day of work.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":75,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":34.467627090577906},{"name":"Sweet","score":27.175442954131483},{"name":"Mint","score":27.016062261963903},{"name":"Pungent","score":24.648120549759895},{"name":"Woody","score":12.403750620963738}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":72.025583705911572},{"name":"Euphoric","score":66.595255837059113},{"name":"Happy","score":50.246315615168072},{"name":"Uplifted","score":45.544585196224538},{"name":"Giggly","score":37.2112518628912}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":39.009976817353866},{"name":"Pain","score":29.509231660871006},{"name":"Depression","score":27.300670640834575},{"name":"Insomnia","score":17.515317105481039},{"name":"Nausea","score":16.980253353204173}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":21.112767014406355},{"name":"PMS","score":10.479797979797981},{"name":"Arthritis","score":4.9863387978142075},{"name":"PTSD","score":4.9863387978142075},{"name":"Migraines","score":4.7017304189435336}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":20.828158635535683},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":16.001200529889058},{"name":"Dizzy","score":3.1876138433515484},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.20856102003643},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.9239526411657559}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gorilla-cookies_100x100_13e8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/663214/b/gorilla-cookies__primary_0b75.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gorilla-cookies_100x100_efe9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/655058/b/gorilla-cookies__primary_2c33.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gorilla-cookies_100x100_c592.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/646803/b/gorilla-cookies__primary_dc1a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gorilla-cookies_100x100_44db.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/632243/b/gorilla-cookies__primary_6db3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gorilla-cookies_100x100_1be8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/617557/b/gorilla-cookies__primary_5a5f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gorilla-cookies_100x100_e734.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/606508/b/gorilla-cookies__primary_6f2b.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":10,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA","San Francisco, CA","Detroit, MI","Portland, OR","Toronto, ON","China","Ottawa, ON","Seattle, WA","Fremont, CA","Hayward, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.72/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Gorilla Glue #4","subtitle":null,"slug":"gorilla-glue-4","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-glue-4","symbol":"Gg4","applink":"leafly://strain/gorilla-glue-4"},{"name":"Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies","subtitle":null,"slug":"thin-mint","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/thin-mint","symbol":"Tm","applink":"leafly://strain/thin-mint"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
