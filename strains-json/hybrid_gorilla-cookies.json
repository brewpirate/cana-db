I've had it about 3 times so far always over 87% THC alone. This stuff smells and tastes so good it stomps on Girl Scout Cookies in my opinion, but that's my opinion. I found it best for Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, Pain & Spasms. This is a A++++++ concentrate strain. ENJOY!!!!",

            "text": "Definitely an interesting strain, to say the least. The aroma is quite unique, almost minty but with the pungency characteristic of Gorilla Glue, and can be tasted during consumption. I'm not the biggest fan of Gorilla Glue's heavily sedating effects, but this strain is just the right blend of the parental lineages. The nugs are impressively sized, sticky and dense, caked with crystals and short, dark orange hairs. The high will leave you couchlocked for hours watching videos of spiders on youtube- and absolutely entranced the entire time. Great strain for vegetating or knocking yourself out after a long day of work.",
