Body high helped me to relax so could I could go to sleep. But that have been from the relief of my anxiety which has been outta control. Head high helped me drift off to a deep sleep which was wonderful. What a wonderful relief! I'd highly recommend for after work/evening use for pain/nausea/anxiety. So nice to have a flower that still works!",
