The smoke is smooth and sweet, and brings on a very tranquil stone. The recent CW Analytics analysis we received came in at 25.6% THC with a great terpene profile. You have to experience Grape Calyx yourself to truly understand just how great this one is. We're really glad to see Leafly profile this boutique strain. Certainly a 5 star in our books.",
