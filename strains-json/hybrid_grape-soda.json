I found that Grape Soda provides similar benefits to its predecessor, Tahoe OG. Because of its dominant somatic effects, I wouldn't recommend this strain for physically strenuous activities. However, Grape Soda is an excellent strain for relaxing the body before reading, stretching, beginner yoga, or just laying down for some much needed rest. Look \ud83d\udc40 for big purple flowers, mad tricomes; with lemon \ud83c\udf4b and purple, I'm mean, \"grape\" aromas. ~Remember to like/follow \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffd",
