            "text": "Spring is in the air, bringing fresh flowers, warmer days, and cleansing rain. But through the waxing evenings and lazy Sundays, intensive spring cleaning, an exhaustive daylight saving switch-up, and the stress of pre-summer planning tends to make spring a tiring season. Thankfully, these trying activities don\u2019t have to be so daunting with a little cannabis on hand.\n\nEnjoy preparing your garden or tackling that over-stuffed closet with some energizing strains that will get you in tune with the changing season. Below, discover our go-to strains for springtime activities and ease yourself into the months ahead.\nDon\u2019t Let Daylight Saving Time Leave You Exhausted\n(anyaberkut/iStock)\nAM Strain Recommendation: Grapefruit Diesel\nPM Strain Recommendation: King Louis XIII\nDaylight Saving Time is a twice-yearly event that leads to a physical and mental adjustment for most of the country. While \u201cspring ahead\u201d means more sunshine, it also signals the loss of an hour of coveted sleep. Make the best of this change and avoid morning grogginess by going to bed early and giving yourself a mental boost for the morning.\nTo help you transition to this shift in time, choose a relaxing indica when you\u2019re ready for bed. We love King Louis XIII, known for its insomnia benefits, to help the body ease into sleep an hour early. In the morning, the hybrid Grapefruit Diesel will give you a burst of energy that will leave you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as you get ready for the day right on schedule.\nFind Grapefruit Diesel Nearby\nFind King Louis XVIII Nearby\n\nMake Spring Cleaning Fun by Putting Some Pep in Your Step\n(Peopleimages/iStock)\nStrain Recommendation: Super Lemon Haze\nSpring cleaning might seem like a huge undertaking, but there\u2019s something so satisfying about throwing open your windows and clearing the dust off your shelves in the fresh spring air. Jumping into this task is well worth it\u2014in the end you\u2019ll feel refreshed, your place will be spotless, and you can finally breathe a big sigh of relief.\nTo help you stay motivated as you clean top to bottom, try a stimulating sativa such as Super Lemon Haze.

While waiting for sunshine and warmth to steadily return and revive you, manage rainy weather blues with some TLC and the proper strain.\nBubbleberry is an excellent pick for relieving stress, depression, and inflammatory pain that can be aggravated by rainy weather. This hybrid provides a giggly, happy high that will make you feel closer to the sun while waiting for spring showers to bring on the other kind of flowers.\nFind Bubbleberry Nearby\n\nPair the Right Greens With Your Gardening Routine\n(eclipse_images/iStock)\nStrain Recommendation: Green Crack\nOne of the most magical times of the year is the beginning of spring since it kicks off the start of the growing season.

Consider the sativa Green Crack; with a mental buzz and the sharp uptick of energy it provides, you\u2019ll power through the laborious aspects while enjoying the pleasurable ones, such as when you plant that first seedling in some fresh soil.\nFind Green Crack Nearby",

    "description": "<p>Grapefruit Diesel is a hybrid strain that is usually indica-dominant but gives most users a focused mental high that is more commonly associated with sativas.

These plants show more of their indica side when growing, staying short and branchy and flowering within 8 weeks. Grapefruit Diesel&rsquo;s flowers sometimes have hints of pink coloring and a potent smell of over ripe citrus fruit. With THC levels between 15 and 20%, the effects should be as strong as the scent.
