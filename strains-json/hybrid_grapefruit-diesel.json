But through the waxing evenings and lazy Sundays, intensive spring cleaning, an exhaustive daylight saving switch-up, and the stress of pre-summer planning tends to make spring a tiring season. Thankfully, these trying activities don’t have to be so daunting with a little cannabis on hand.\n\nEnjoy preparing your garden or tackling that over-stuffed closet with some energizing strains that will get you in tune with the changing season. Below, discover our go-to strains for springtime activities and ease yourself into the months ahead.\nDon’t Let Daylight Saving Time Leave You Exhausted\n(anyaberkut/iStock)\nAM Strain Recommendation: Grapefruit Diesel\nPM Strain Recommendation: King Louis XIII\nDaylight Saving Time is a twice-yearly event that leads to a physical and mental adjustment for most of the country. While “spring ahead” means more sunshine, it also signals the loss of an hour of coveted sleep.

We love King Louis XIII, known for its insomnia benefits, to help the body ease into sleep an hour early. In the morning, the hybrid Grapefruit Diesel will give you a burst of energy that will leave you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as you get ready for the day right on schedule.\nFind Grapefruit Diesel Nearby\nFind King Louis XVIII Nearby\n\nMake Spring Cleaning Fun by Putting Some Pep in Your Step\n(Peopleimages/iStock)\nStrain Recommendation: Super Lemon Haze\nSpring cleaning might seem like a huge undertaking, but there’s something so satisfying about throwing open your windows and clearing the dust off your shelves in the fresh spring air.
