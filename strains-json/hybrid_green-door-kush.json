            "text": "As a cancer patient, I have been through dozens of strains and use my weed to keep me out of the hospital. While the 'Green Door Kush' is a proprietary strain only available through one coop, it is head and shoulders above the rest. The main factor is the balance. One drag is enough to send a novice smoker into bliss. For more advaced, you can tank yourself as far as you need to get relief and still maintain some connection to reality.\r\n\r\nI could dose about every 90 minutes to replace 10 mg of oxycontin every four hours and a continuous Fentanyl patch. If you know your opiates, then you know this is serious medicine.\r\n\r\nAfter 48 hours of not holding down water, OG wouldn't do it, but the GDK kept me out of the hospital.\r\n\r\nI lost nearly half of my body weight and GDK helped me turn the corner to avoid going on a feeding tube.\r\n\r\nWhile I can get relief with many other strains for most situations, GDK helps in EVERY situation and sometimes is the only strain in my arsenal that gets the job done.",
