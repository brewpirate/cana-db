PA medical grade from Cresco labs.  Very clean quality, very over the top flavorful.  A drier waxy crumble like texture, a bit more difficult to work with than some more waxy concentrates i have had.  Purity though is very impressive.  \n\nTaste wise it\u0027s very lime oriented, very fruity and very fragrant.  The effect is surprisingly strong and very clear.  My body feels relaxed but not necessarily numbed out and i\u0027ve been listening to Smashing Pumpkins like i\u0027m 14 again.  Price is steep here in PA to get your hands on this product, but not judging that and only the product itself.  This is a good place to set the bar as far as what i\u0027ve experienced here in PA.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/tAHHcVjF5EvieYWgrsxPA0WBCr8=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fRAbBXkNBSHOIMMxhio7k_wide-brim-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":14,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":60.555555555555557},{"name":"Lime","score":38.333333333333329},{"name":"Citrus","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Diesel","score":22.222222222222221},{"name":"Berry","score":11.111111111111111}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":96.666666666666657},{"name":"Relaxed","score":96.666666666666657},{"name":"Uplifted","score":86.666666666666657},{"name":"Focused","score":81.666666666666657},{"name":"Creative","score":60.555555555555557}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":59.444444444444443},{"name":"Depression","score":53.333333333333329},{"name":"Pain","score":42.222222222222221},{"name":"Headaches","score":32.222222222222221},{"name":"Nausea","score":27.222222222222221}],"conditions":[{"name":"PTSD","score":27.222222222222221},{"name":"Anxiety","score":22.222222222222221},{"name":"Cancer","score":11.111111111111111},{"name":"Epilepsy","score":11.111111111111111},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","score":11.111111111111111}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":38.333333333333329},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":22.222222222222221}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/green-line-og_100x100_8c93.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001066/b/green-line-og__primary_3f86.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/green-line-og_100x100_f5aa.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000983/b/green-line-og__primary_bc4a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/green-line-og_100x100_a9b0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/709136/b/green-line-og__primary_4878.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/green-line-og_100x100_4a2b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/709387/b/green-line-og__primary_2d69.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":4,"popularCities":["Chicago, IL","Collinsville, IL","Elmwood Park, IL","Fulton, IL","Highland Park, IL","Litchfield, IL","Los Angeles, CA","Milan, IL","Northbrook, IL","Oak Park, IL"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.78571428571429/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Lime Skunk","subtitle":null,"slug":"lime-skunk","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/lime-skunk","symbol":"Lsk","applink":"leafly://strain/lime-skunk"},{"name":"Ghost OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"ghost-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og","symbol":"Gok","applink":"leafly://strain/ghost-og"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
