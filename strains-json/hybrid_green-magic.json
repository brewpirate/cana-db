Its a very strong euphoria with a very strong pulling body high, which is amazing if you can handle it. I was so in tune with all of my senses, this may seem odd but I think my pupils were like vibrating lol. A very pungent, like veryyyy strong smell. Anyways, the green magic is definitely green magic.
