            "text": "After a brutal winter that ravaged most of the United States, many of you are probably thrilled that the first day of spring is finally upon us. To celebrate the arrival of an extra hour of sunlight, blossoming flowers, and warmer weather, here are 10 strains that come in like a lion but stick with you like a lamb.\nPeach Spice\n\nStrain combination: Cotton Candy Kush and Green Queen\n\nThe sweet pear flavor in Cotton Candy Kush is balanced wonderfully by the spicy, nutty character of Green Queen.\nCherry Creamsicle\n\nStrain combination: Vanilla Kush and Cherry Bomb\n\nThe heavier, smooth Vanilla Kush is beautifully complemented by the sweet cherry flavor of the lighter Cherry Bomb.\nStrawberry Mojito\n\nStrain combination: Strawberry Kush and Thin Mint\n\nThe unmistakable Thin Mint flavor and hybrid effects are perfectly balanced by the more physical Strawberry Kush.\nBerry Tartlet\n\nStrain\u00a0combination: Blackberry Kush and Lemon Haze\n\nThese two strong flavors coupled with contrasting effects provide a balanced, memorable experience.\nBanana Brush\n\nStrain combination: Banana Kush and Durban Poison\n\nThe distinct sweetness of Banana Kush could only be matched with an earthy, uplifting flower like Durban Poison.\nBlue Bayou\n\nStrain combination: Blue Cheese and Blue Haze\n\nBlue cheese and peppered pear is the name of the game with these two acclaimed hybrids.\nWaldorf\n\nStrain combination: SAGE\u00a0and Island Sweet Skunk\n\nThe spicy sandalwood and earthy flavors of SAGE combined with Island Sweet Skunk\u2019s buttery apple taste creates a pairing reminiscent of a classic Waldorf salad.\nRubies \u2018n Roses\n\nStrain combination: White Russian and Grapefruit\n\nIn a happy synthesis of citrus, floral, and earthy undertones, this pair provides a pleasant, invigorating lift.\nTropical Vacation\n\nStrain combination: Pineapple Express and Cannalope Haze\n\nLet this fruity coalescence of sweet pineapple, mango, and berry take you far, far away.\nChocolate Peel\n\nStrain combination: Orange Kush and Chocolope\n\nOrange and chocolate, with additional sweet and earthy\u00a0undertones, make this pair a no-brainer.\nPhoto credits: header\u00a0strawberry mint, pear blue cheese, grapefruit, blackberry lemon, cherry vanilla, banana pine, chocolate orange, peach and spices, mango pineapple, apple sage\u00a0",

            "text": "First, let me state that I am very picky in what strains I medicate with.  I have tried all kinds of strains and am very specific in the effects I want to feel.  I need cannabis to 1) Calm my stomach/intestines immediately and take away nausea - and - 2) Provide me with a clear, manageable high that does NOT induce paranoia or anxiety.  \r\n\r\nI have severe IBS, GERD and a host of other intestinal issues, so a high CBD count is important to me.  Getting so high I'm out of my head is NOT my main priority so I tend to stick to heavy, thick indicas, but I tried Green Queen per the suggestion of someone at my nearby access point.  Out of everything I have tried, this meets my needs perfectly - even better than my old favorite Romulan (which this has in it).  \r\n\r\nIt's a brilliant, clear-headed high that remains very manageable if you keep your dosage controlled.  Like anything, if you take too much, it can get pretty wild, as the THC content in this is very high, so I advise trying just a small amount the first time.  It lasts a long time - this strain has legs!  \r\n\r\nIt's the most manageable, calm, NON-NEUROTIC high I've ever experienced.  I experienced no anxiety at all, just a crisp, clean high that immediately ended my nausea and other unpleasant IBS issues.  It allowed me to function in public, in front of others, perfectly - no weird internal freak-out feeling, just a smiling, confident high.  I even feel a bit silly on it, due to the lack of anxiety.\r\n\r\nCombine the mental clarity with the incredibly fast and powerful physical healing effects and you have what is now my new favorite strain.  I recommend this for anyone looking for a crisp, fun, manageable high, and for anyone in need of immediate physical pain relief.  ",

Starts with an uplifted feeling, and a head buzz. Very mild body buzz that only seems noticeable when youre not being active. Then come the giggles, and the munchies. Damn this strain makes me eat. Great for listening to music, or dancing. On the comedown i got pretty tired and crashed hard, felt pretty groggy next day as well. Favorite strain ive tried so far",
