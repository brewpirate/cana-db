I have tried all kinds of strains and am very specific in the effects I want to feel.  I need cannabis to 1) Calm my stomach/intestines immediately and take away nausea - and - 2) Provide me with a clear, manageable high that does NOT induce paranoia or anxiety.  \r\n\r\nI have severe IBS, GERD and a host of other intestinal issues, so a high CBD count is important to me.  Getting so high I\u0027m out of my head is NOT my main priority so I tend to stick to heavy, thick indicas, but I tried Green Queen per the suggestion of someone at my nearby access point.  Out of everything I have tried, this meets my needs perfectly - even better than my old favorite Romulan (which this has in it).  \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a brilliant, clear-headed high that remains very manageable if you keep your dosage controlled.  Like anything, if you take too much, it can get pretty wild, as the THC content in this is very high, so I advise trying just a small amount the first time.  It lasts a long time - this strain has legs!  \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s the most manageable, calm, NON-NEUROTIC high I\u0027ve ever experienced.  I experienced no anxiety at all, just a crisp, clean high that immediately ended my nausea and other unpleasant IBS issues.  It allowed me to function in public, in front of others, perfectly - no weird internal freak-out feeling, just a smiling, confident high.  I even feel a bit silly on it, due to the lack of anxiety.\r\n\r\nCombine the mental clarity with the incredibly fast and powerful physical healing effects and you have what is now my new favorite strain.  I recommend this for anyone looking for a crisp, fun, manageable high, and for anyone in need of immediate physical pain relief.
