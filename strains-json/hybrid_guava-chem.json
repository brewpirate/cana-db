I\u0027ve smoked it a dozen times or so. It\u0027s a very clear head high. It last for about two hours. It\u0027s one of those flowers that builds on its high if you smoke a lot of it in one sitting. You can\u0027t just smoke one bowl and expect to get all of its potency. It\u0027s nice for people with high tolerance and lower tolerance as well. Like most sativas, it helps deal with fatigue and general malaise.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1615011,"username":"superocean9","text":"Lucky to find this outstanding strain in soft pressed Hash form. Really easy on the throat with great uplifting relaxed mindset. The absence of any couch lock makes for a truly fun experience. Explore outdoors or get creative on this one.
