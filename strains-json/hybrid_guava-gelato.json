While we were looking at some sativa flowers the word Gelato caught the corner of my eye on the hybrid shelf. I\u0027m a huge fan of Gelato, it\u0027s one of the most potent strains I\u0027ve tried, so I got an eighth of Guava Gelato and headed straight home. \n\nI figured that I probably won\u0027t get anything done if I smoked it as soon as I got home so I should wait until tonight. Of course as soon as I got home I abandoned the idea of being productive and decided to get high instead (it just sounded more fun). \n\nSo I took 4 or 5 (I lost count about 15 seconds after the first one) big bong hits. After doing so, I headed to the couch and grabbed the remote. That\u0027s as far as I got. Then after sitting there with the remote pointed at a blank screen for anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes, I became somewhat more aware and realized how high I was. I was friggin\u0027 HIGH! I smoked a lot of weed over the last 30 years and took enough acid in college to be a good judge of \"high\" and I was definitely high.\n\nBut here\u0027s the cool part... That was about 30 minutes ago and now I\u0027m functional and actually getting stuff done. It\u0027s weird, I\u0027m still super high but it\u0027s like the cognitive part of my brain was switched back on. This is almost the perfect hybrid. I\u0027m motivated but not wired and I\u0027m super high but not brain dead stoned.\n\nI think I found a new number one favorite which puts Wedding Cake in second after being in the top spot for about a year!\n\nHighest recommendation!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1608691,"username":"maryjane1705","text":"Unique flavour.
