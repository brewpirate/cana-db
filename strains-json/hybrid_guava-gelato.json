            "text": "The weather is beautiful today and I have a lot I needed to get done but I also wanted to get high so I asked my bud-tender what she'd recommend. While we were looking at some sativa flowers the word Gelato caught the corner of my eye on the hybrid shelf. I'm a huge fan of Gelato, it's one of the most potent strains I've tried, so I got an eighth of Guava Gelato and headed straight home. \n\nI figured that I probably won't get anything done if I smoked it as soon as I got home so I should wait until tonight. Of course as soon as I got home I abandoned the idea of being productive and decided to get high instead (it just sounded more fun). \n\nSo I took 4 or 5 (I lost count about 15 seconds after the first one) big bong hits. After doing so, I headed to the couch and grabbed the remote. That's as far as I got. Then after sitting there with the remote pointed at a blank screen for anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes, I became somewhat more aware and realized how high I was. I was friggin' HIGH! I smoked a lot of weed over the last 30 years and took enough acid in college to be a good judge of \"high\" and I was definitely high.\n\nBut here's the cool part... That was about 30 minutes ago and now I'm functional and actually getting stuff done. It's weird, I'm still super high but it's like the cognitive part of my brain was switched back on. This is almost the perfect hybrid. I'm motivated but not wired and I'm super high but not brain dead stoned.\n\nI think I found a new number one favorite which puts Wedding Cake in second after being in the top spot for about a year!\n\nHighest recommendation!",
