With names based on Breaking Bad puns and overpriced fashion accessories, maybe a few of these varieties will pique your interest. Already had a chance to test drive one of these fine specimens? Review, review, review. We\u0027re dying to know what you thought!\n   1. Dank Schrader\nCharacteristics of Dank Schrader:\n\nDank Schrader is the house strain at The Healing Center in Vancouver, BC. The strain was developed during the final season of Breaking Bad and is named after DEA Agent Hank Schrader, a character on the show. Dank Schrader crosses Rockstar Kush with Bubba Kush to create a potent and relaxing indica-driven hybrid that has tested out as high as 27% THC according to dispensary’s lab results, performed by Hedron Analytical.\n\n   2. Pineapple Purps\nCharacteristics of Pineapple Purps:\n\nPineapple Purps is a sativa-dominant strain that is rarely found but always cherished by those looking for strains with a high THCV cannabinoid profile. THCV, a compound known to block panic attacks, reduce Parkinson’s tremors, and suppress the appetite, is typically only found in trace amounts in most cannabis, but Pineapple Purps is a special variety that can express a THC:THCV ratio of 3:1. This strain is highly psychoactive and energetic, but its effects generally won’t last as long as low-THCV varieties. \n\n   3. Gucci OG\nCharacteristics of Gucci OG:\n\nGucci OG is an OG Kush variant named with the lavish cannabis connoisseur in mind. Hailing from southern California like so many of its OG relatives, Gucci OG takes on the family’s signature aroma of pine and lemon, but with a unique hint of sweet berry. This hybrid’s effect can vary with different doses; small amounts may provide a spark of energy and creativity, while larger doses tend to give way to heavy sedation or dizzying euphoria. \n\n   4. White Fire 43\nCharacteristics of White Fire 43:\n\nWhite Fire 43 is a select phenotype of White Fire OG grown by TLC Collective in Los Angeles, CA. Number 43 was the standout phenotype in a lot of over 500 White Fire OG seeds, originally bred by OG Raskal. White Fire 43 is known for its exceptional cannabinoid production, with claims of test results regularly nearing 30%. The strong medicinal and pain-fighting effects are ushered in with a pungent earthy aroma that is amplified by flavors of lemons and sour citrus. White Fire 43 is an indica-dominant hybrid that is great before bedtime, helping you relax, decompress, and find sleep.\n\n   5. Orange Cookies\nCharacteristics of Orange Cookies:\n\nOrange Cookies bred by Franchise Genetics is a hybrid that combines Orange Juice with the renowned GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies). A flavor-packed strain, Orange Cookies expresses itself with a strong aroma of sweet citrus that closely resembles a fresh tangerine. The flavors of Orange Cookies gives way to deep calming body effects that mingle with a euphoric cerebral buzz to leave you happy and relaxed.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12002042/new-strains-alert-dank-schrader-pineapple-purps-gucci-og-white-fi.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-dank-schrader-pineapple-purps-gucci-og-white-fi"}],"reviewCount":53,"flavors":[{"name":"Pine","score":7.34126984126984},{"name":"Earthy","score":6.5476190476190474},{"name":"Berry","score":6.15079365079365},{"name":"Lemon","score":6.15079365079365},{"name":"Sweet","score":2.7777777777777777}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":79.960317460317469},{"name":"Relaxed","score":29.166666666666668},{"name":"Euphoric","score":24.999999999999996},{"name":"Uplifted","score":21.230158730158728},{"name":"Talkative","score":11.904761904761903}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Cramps","score":50.3968253968254},{"name":"Depression","score":16.865079365079364},{"name":"Stress","score":13.095238095238095},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":10.317460317460316},{"name":"Insomnia","score":9.92063492063492}],"conditions":[{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":50.3968253968254},{"name":"Anxiety","score":11.507936507936506},{"name":"PTSD","score":4.96031746031746},{"name":"Hypertension","score":4.5634920634920633},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.5634920634920633}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":15.674603174603174},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":4.96031746031746},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.79365079365079361}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_d7c4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002609/b/gucci-og__primary_2f76.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_5b2a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/613389/b/gucci-og__primary_4f51.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_204b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/602762/b/gucci-og__primary_6e52.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_4404.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/514065/b/gucci-og__primary_268c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_c831.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/484330/b/gucci-og__primary_dbe3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_015f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/385421/b/gucci-og__primary_bfe2.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":10,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA","Santa Ana, CA","Ann Arbor, MI","Boulder, CO","Detroit, MI","Long Beach, CA","Pueblo West, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/gucci-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.71698113207547/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":70,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

With names based on Breaking Bad puns and overpriced fashion accessories, maybe a few of these varieties will pique your interest. Already had a chance to test drive one of these fine specimens? Review, review, review. We\u0027re dying to know what you thought!\n   1. Dank Schrader\nCharacteristics of Dank Schrader:\n\nDank Schrader is the house strain at The Healing Center in Vancouver, BC. The strain was developed during the final season of Breaking Bad and is named after DEA Agent Hank Schrader, a character on the show. Dank Schrader crosses Rockstar Kush with Bubba Kush to create a potent and relaxing indica-driven hybrid that has tested out as high as 27% THC according to dispensary’s lab results, performed by Hedron Analytical.\n\n   2. Pineapple Purps\nCharacteristics of Pineapple Purps:\n\nPineapple Purps is a sativa-dominant strain that is rarely found but always cherished by those looking for strains with a high THCV cannabinoid profile. THCV, a compound known to block panic attacks, reduce Parkinson’s tremors, and suppress the appetite, is typically only found in trace amounts in most cannabis, but Pineapple Purps is a special variety that can express a THC:THCV ratio of 3:1. This strain is highly psychoactive and energetic, but its effects generally won’t last as long as low-THCV varieties. \n\n   3. Gucci OG\nCharacteristics of Gucci OG:\n\nGucci OG is an OG Kush variant named with the lavish cannabis connoisseur in mind. Hailing from southern California like so many of its OG relatives, Gucci OG takes on the family’s signature aroma of pine and lemon, but with a unique hint of sweet berry. This hybrid’s effect can vary with different doses; small amounts may provide a spark of energy and creativity, while larger doses tend to give way to heavy sedation or dizzying euphoria. \n\n   4. White Fire 43\nCharacteristics of White Fire 43:\n\nWhite Fire 43 is a select phenotype of White Fire OG grown by TLC Collective in Los Angeles, CA. Number 43 was the standout phenotype in a lot of over 500 White Fire OG seeds, originally bred by OG Raskal. White Fire 43 is known for its exceptional cannabinoid production, with claims of test results regularly nearing 30%. The strong medicinal and pain-fighting effects are ushered in with a pungent earthy aroma that is amplified by flavors of lemons and sour citrus. White Fire 43 is an indica-dominant hybrid that is great before bedtime, helping you relax, decompress, and find sleep.\n\n   5. Orange Cookies\nCharacteristics of Orange Cookies:\n\nOrange Cookies bred by Franchise Genetics is a hybrid that combines Orange Juice with the renowned GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies). A flavor-packed strain, Orange Cookies expresses itself with a strong aroma of sweet citrus that closely resembles a fresh tangerine. The flavors of Orange Cookies gives way to deep calming body effects that mingle with a euphoric cerebral buzz to leave you happy and relaxed.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12002042/new-strains-alert-dank-schrader-pineapple-purps-gucci-og-white-fi.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-dank-schrader-pineapple-purps-gucci-og-white-fi"}],"reviewCount":53,"flavors":[{"name":"Pine","score":7.34126984126984},{"name":"Earthy","score":6.5476190476190474},{"name":"Berry","score":6.15079365079365},{"name":"Lemon","score":6.15079365079365},{"name":"Sweet","score":2.7777777777777777}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":79.960317460317469},{"name":"Relaxed","score":29.166666666666668},{"name":"Euphoric","score":24.999999999999996},{"name":"Uplifted","score":21.230158730158728},{"name":"Talkative","score":11.904761904761903}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Cramps","score":50.3968253968254},{"name":"Depression","score":16.865079365079364},{"name":"Stress","score":13.095238095238095},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":10.317460317460316},{"name":"Insomnia","score":9.92063492063492}],"conditions":[{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":50.3968253968254},{"name":"Anxiety","score":11.507936507936506},{"name":"PTSD","score":4.96031746031746},{"name":"Hypertension","score":4.5634920634920633},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.5634920634920633}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":15.674603174603174},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":4.96031746031746},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.79365079365079361}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_d7c4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002609/b/gucci-og__primary_2f76.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_5b2a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/613389/b/gucci-og__primary_4f51.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_204b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/602762/b/gucci-og__primary_6e52.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_4404.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/514065/b/gucci-og__primary_268c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_c831.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/484330/b/gucci-og__primary_dbe3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gucci-og_100x100_015f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/385421/b/gucci-og__primary_bfe2.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":10,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA","Santa Ana, CA","Ann Arbor, MI","Boulder, CO","Detroit, MI","Long Beach, CA","Pueblo West, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/gucci-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.71698113207547/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":70,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
