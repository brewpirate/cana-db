            "text": "My tolerance is maybe kinda low so take my judgement with a grain of salt, but if you're anything like me, this strain will kick your ass. Don't discount it because of its low percentages. \n\nI was recommended it because my dispensary was out of the Cannatonic I was hoping to get, which I use to manage my severe chronic pain. This variant had much less CBD (like 6:5 CBD:THC compared to 2:1 that I'm used to), but I said what the heck and decided to try it. It doesn't do very much for my pain (severe fibro as well as joint inflammation and pain from hyperextension and dislocations) and has a huge head high. \n\nI vaped one cycle's worth (5min) last night, was hit almost immediately with the head high and a very little bit of pain relief, but felt like it was wearing off about half an hour later. Stupidly, I went to go vape another cycle. Two cycles isn't that unusual for me, it does get me pretty high but I've never had a *bad* (or stressful) experience until last night. I was pretty instantly zonked by this second cycle, and started dissociating pretty badly. I felt like nothing was real and my past self was present and a different person. To be fair, I do sometimes have psychotic episodes, so this may have just triggered that, but no other CBD strain I've tried has done that to me. I also got SUUUPER dizzy; I usually get dizzy when I get high but this was like, massive. I was falling all over the place.\n\nI ended up having to sleep the high off and slept for a very long time. The bowl wasn't spent so I vaped another round on it like half an hour ago, I've got a huge head high and only a little pain relief, not like I get with other CBD strains. I'm not dissociating from just one cycle, but I'm still pretty out of it, but not really giggly like I've gotten with other strains, just kind-of introspective, I guess? And hyperfocused but not in a useful way (maybe because the pain isn't gone and that's clouding my mind).\n\nAll in all, it just wasn't what I was looking for in a supposedly CBD strain. If you're going for a contemplative head high, it might be more for you, but if you're looking for pain relief, I'd look elsewhere.",
