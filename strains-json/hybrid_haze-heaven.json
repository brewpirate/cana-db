Dark amber turns to a transparent yellow when \"snaked\" a little bit.\nSmell/Taste: This was a really non distinct smell and taste. Its dank and pungent, but doesnt really resemble anything. I feel like haze and its hybrids have a lemon-catpiss flavor spectrum alot of times, and if it falls inbetween instead of peaning one side,it can almost seem flavorless. Not one id goto for flavor again.\nEffects: I was really happy, im wary of indica dominant  haze strains, but this one deoivers the classic haze energy boost along with a nice relaxing body high and a fairly focused mindset, along with a happy mood.\nI would recommend this if you dont care much about taste and want a good mid day stress/pain reliver.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1295205,"username":"pritzeyprincess","text":"I am absolutely happy with relieving my pain as I can barely get around #excited\n\n","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3231","title":"New Strains Alert: Blue Heron, Haze Heaven, Grimace, Garlic Bud, and Nurse Jackie","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1414177200000)\/","text":"New strains are here, and many more are on the way!
