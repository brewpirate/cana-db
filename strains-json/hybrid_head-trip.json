I loaded it and had taken my trusty glass straw/honey collector to dab at the sides. The hits were very clean and there was a mild pine taste. Within a few seconds I was experiencing a wobble to my vision, ushering in that psychedelic feel this strain gets it\u0027s name from. The sensation was pleasant and I sank into the couch for a bit.\n\tAbout forty minutes had passed and the psychedelia was fading more and more until the familiar dull ache returned to my neck, shoulder and hip. Round two of dabbing was a little interesting. I had just finished putting a nice glow on my honey collector and as I was about to dab a small amount. I had accidentally dabbed a much larger dose. The effects were the very same, albeit much more intense. I became a little queasy and dizzy, but that has definitely happened before when I had accidentally dabbed a big piece of High Priority instead of the little one that I was aiming for on the other side of my straw... whoops, got them both! I vomited and learned an important lesson then, as I have now. Too much, too fast could be a real damper on a fun night.  \n\tThe immediate effects of this strain\u0027s golden concentrate were in the forms of pain relief and  muscle relaxation. I also noticed a reduction in stress, and anxiety after medicating with this concentrate. The psychedelic effect is fun and provides a great social experience while remaining mellow, relaxed and happy. I would warn the user to be a bit careful and start off slowly as it can be a real heavy hitter, or a headtrip, if you will.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"},{"id":1387164,"username":"Geno89","text":"Pain \u0026 Strees Reliever ","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":27,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":5.1724137931034484},{"name":"Pine","score":3.4482758620689653},{"name":"Coffee","score":3.4482758620689653},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":2.5862068965517242},{"name":"Woody","score":2.5862068965517242}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":27.155172413793103},{"name":"Focused","score":20.258620689655174},{"name":"Happy","score":12.068965517241379},{"name":"Uplifted","score":8.6206896551724146},{"name":"Euphoric","score":6.8965517241379306}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":7.7586206896551726},{"name":"Headaches","score":6.0344827586206895},{"name":"Pain","score":6.0344827586206895},{"name":"Depression","score":5.1724137931034484},{"name":"Insomnia","score":4.3103448275862073}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":3.4482758620689653},{"name":"Migraines","score":1.7241379310344827},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":0.86206896551724133},{"name":"Cancer","score":0.86206896551724133},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":0.86206896551724133}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.7241379310344827},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":1.7241379310344827},{"name":"Paranoid","score":0.86206896551724133}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/head-trip/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/head-trip/primary?width=1024"}],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":["Vancouver, BC","Calgary, AB","Denver, CO","Eugene, OR","Hamilton, ON","Montr√©al, QC","Newport, OR","Portland, OR","Rainier, OR","San Francisco, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/head-trip","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.33333333333333/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Snow Lotus","subtitle":null,"slug":"snow-lotus","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus","symbol":"Slt","applink":"leafly://strain/snow-lotus"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
