            "text": "I could not smell much after I had taken several whiffs, but Headtrip Golden Shatter was glassy and had some really satisfying snaps to it. I loaded it and had taken my trusty glass straw/honey collector to dab at the sides. The hits were very clean and there was a mild pine taste. Within a few seconds I was experiencing a wobble to my vision, ushering in that psychedelic feel this strain gets it's name from. The sensation was pleasant and I sank into the couch for a bit.\n\tAbout forty minutes had passed and the psychedelia was fading more and more until the familiar dull ache returned to my neck, shoulder and hip. Round two of dabbing was a little interesting. I had just finished putting a nice glow on my honey collector and as I was about to dab a small amount. I had accidentally dabbed a much larger dose. The effects were the very same, albeit much more intense. I became a little queasy and dizzy, but that has definitely happened before when I had accidentally dabbed a big piece of High Priority instead of the little one that I was aiming for on the other side of my straw... whoops, got them both! I vomited and learned an important lesson then, as I have now. Too much, too fast could be a real damper on a fun night.  \n\tThe immediate effects of this strain's golden concentrate were in the forms of pain relief and  muscle relaxation. I also noticed a reduction in stress, and anxiety after medicating with this concentrate. The psychedelic effect is fun and provides a great social experience while remaining mellow, relaxed and happy. I would warn the user to be a bit careful and start off slowly as it can be a real heavy hitter, or a headtrip, if you will.",
