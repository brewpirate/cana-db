            "text": "Psychedelic rock was born out of 1960s psychedelia culture that embraced mind-altering hallucinogens in an increasingly globalized world. The resulting music was eclectic, experimental, and mentally stimulating\u2014the kind of music that is candy for the mind.\n\nToday, these influences continue to thrive in the music of modern psychedelic rock musicians, who often incorporate other genres such as world, jazz, electronic, and pop for a fresher feel. Enjoy the following psychedelic rock albums with a loaded pipe in hand and get lost in a groovy mind-altering experience.\nSpace Is Still the Place by The Bright Light Social Hour\n(Courtesy of The Bright Light Social Hour)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Headband\nSpace Is Still the Place, released in 2015, is The Bright Light Social Hour\u2019s latest album and an excellent illustration of their modern psychedelic sound. Hailing from Austin, Texas, the band features bass, guitar, synth, drums, and two vocalists: Together, they create a landscape of tight beats and instrumentation that veers into the otherworldly. The album invites you to explore different dimensions with a touch of grunge, a little grime, and lots of spacey, psychedelic mind-melting sounds.\n\nSketches of Brunswick East by King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard\n(Courtesy of King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Cherry Pie\nKing Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard is an eclectic psychedelic rock band with a wide range of sounds and genres represented in their extensive catalogue of music (in 2017 alone, the band released four distinct concept albums). Of those, Sketches of Brunswick East stands out for its jazzy space themes. The vocals are light and airy, and whispered harmonies flow into each other, creating a musical journey that grabs the listener and pulls them swiftly along a river of psychedelic tunes. If there\u2019s one album from the King Gizzard collection to give a listen, Sketches of Brunswick East is it.\nHarsh Toke by Earthless\n(Courtesy of Earthless)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Kushberry\nHarsh Toke features only two songs, but combined they present listeners with a half hour of mostly instrumental psychedelic rock. The first track, \u201cAcid Crusher,\u201d starts off slow\u2014the melodic tune takes its time to build and bend. Its trance-like vibes encourage a surrendering to the music; close your eyes and you\u2019ll feel as if you\u2019re drifting away. The second track, \u201cMount Swan,\u201d picks up a heavier rock feel and vocals before plunging into an eclectic space and then back into trance-like homeostasis. In its journey through the soundscape, Harsh Toke is sure to delight all the senses.\n\nThe Desaturating Seven by Primus\n(Courtesy of Primus)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Sour Alien\nPrimus\u2019s 2017 album\u00a0The\u00a0Desaturating Seven\u00a0hits hard with Les Claypool\u2019s famous brand of psychedelic rock. The album features Claypool\u2019s distinctive bass and vocals at its epicenter, snatching the listener up before pulling them down the rabbit hole like Alice on her way to Wonderland. The tight grooves encourage movement and emotional release that is unique to bands creating a heavier rock tone. Claypool once described Primus as \u201cpsychedelic polka,\u201d and The\u00a0Desaturating Seven is a keen example of this description, as well as an example of Primus\u2019s unique niche in the musical world.\nPainting With by Animal Collective\n(Courtesy of Animal Collective)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Mother\u2019s Helper\nPainting With, released in 2016, is the latest album by Animal Collective. As per their unique style, Painting With is a distinctive representation of psychedelic rock, featuring elements of pop, indie, and experimental music combined for an eclectic listening experience. Working with a wide array of instruments from synthesizers to drums, the band creates an intensely rich sound that listeners can practically swim in. Rising above the wildly intricate instrumentation are shifting harmonies by all four band members, their voices as bubbly, playful, and trippy as their music. Overall, Painting With provides a soundscape that takes the listener on an experimental journey worth the ride.",

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: With parents OG Kush and Sour Diesel, you can only expect greatness from their offspring, Headband. Its flavor profile is unmistakable, combining the intense aromas of both strains to create a strong earthy diesel scent. Headband acquired its name after the breeders noticed that the strain caused a \u201chalo\u201d of pressure around the forehead when consumed.\nGrow Techniques: Headband is known for its small popcorn-like buds. Because of this, training the plant is necessary to improve the yield. A hydroponic or soil based SCROG (screen of green) will help ensure that all buds have a fair chance to fully develop, improving your yield and bud quality.\nFlowering Time: 9-10 weeks\nYield: Moderate to low\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate to difficult\nClimate: Prefers a moderate to warm climate with temperatures between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: This is a good strain to grow indoors or out. If grown outdoors, it\u2019s best cultivated in regions with temperate fall weather as the flowering time is longer than most strains.\nFeeding: This plant is sativa-dominant with OG lineage, so you need to be on top of your feeding. While the plant is vegging, make sure you are not under feeding or burning the plant.",

            "text": "Very versatile strain. It really has  two different highs to it; one is when it's consumed in low doses, and one is when it is in high doses. The most recent batch of this at Montana Buds is around ~22% THC and ~0.1% CBD, and it has an extremely prominent lemon scent, with a hint of diesel. The flavor was surprisingly more lemony, and the thick smoke gives it a creamy aftertaste. Really outstanding flavor. Now when this strain is taken in lower doses it's ideal for a morning/early afternoon smoke if you need to treat anxiety, depression, or appetite loss. Lower doses will make the high pleasant, but not overpowering. You'll probably feel a slightly tingly cerebral sensation, along with a nice calming body effect. Keep in mind, this strain is very potent, so low doses means only 1-3 small hits (4-5 in a vape). With that you'll still be able to be productive and get things done. Higher doses do indeed give you the headband sensation, just an extremely pleasant pressure all around the crown of your head. The indica side of this strain comes out in the higher doses as well, with a much more intense, melty body effect. Perfect for getting under a warm blanket and playing video games or watching tv, you'll melt into your hed/couch. Great for insomnia as well as anxiety/depression when used at night time. Overall: A+ strain, very diverse in the treatments and effects it can be used for, with a phenomenal smell and flavor to boot. ",
