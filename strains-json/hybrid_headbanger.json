This strain is phenomenal. These days everything seems to be a hybrid and it\u0027s hard to get those pure expressions of sativa energy or indica relaxation, you kind of end up in a purgatory with some hybrids where you\u0027re too monged to do something but you don\u0027t feel completely relaxed either. But THIS to me is a perfect hybrid as I was talking my ass off but also feeling completely euphoric. I said to my girlfriend any more euphoric and I would think I\u0027d taken some ecstasy. I agree completely with the Effects listed here on Leafly. Happy, Euphoric, Uplifted, Talkative but don\u0027t know why people rate Anxiety as high on this one as its a strain I could puff on continuously and just get happier despite how strong it is, and I\u0027m someone who is prone to anxiety from some of the feistier sativa dominant strains. For the first few hours you are in the zone chatting away but later on it really mellows out and lulls you into a blissful slumber.
