    "description": "<p>Heavy Duty Fruity seems to have everything going for it: high yields, yummy flavor, and potency. T. H. Seeds bred this West Coast native from local (and locally named) favorites Killing Garberville, Seattle <a href=\"http://leafly.com/indica/big-bud\">Big Bud</a>, and Mendocino Hash Plant to create a multi-skilled strain. Growers should be aware that plants do not always have classic seven-point leaves, but her unique beauty does not affect her output. Heavy Duty Fruity also gives off a heavy duty sweet smell, so it may require management for indoor growers. What is not a concern is yield and bud size, both of which are consistently large with this strain, both indoors and out. Plants usually flower between 8 and 9 weeks. Depending on when this plant is harvested, her effects range from psychedelic and spacey to mellow relaxation.</p>\n",

You smoke it and you get high and you\u2019d feel like you\u2019re on some acid euphoria. Also it\u2019s best to have sex on this and to listen to chill mixes with beats and bass and a lot of instruments. It\u2019s like giving you a super power of hearing cause you\u2019ll hear all the instruments clearly like you\u2019re in the music itself. ",
