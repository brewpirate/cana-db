            "text": "I purchased a 1/2 oz. of Hell Raiser Og today from the best delivery service in south orange ca, Blue Bird, and I am impressed by the freshness and aromas wafting up my rather large, ( according to my wife) nostrils.  \nThe Leafly overview is quite accurate, so I'll move on to the experience I am having.\nI ground up two nice little buds for a small solo joint, rolled in one Elements ultra thin rice papers.  Please forgive me for my braggadocio when I say no one rolls a better joint. I started early back in 1972 at 15.  I don't know, perhaps it's because, as my dad said, \"You have surgeons hands\", but even then, I had a knack for a rolling a fine joint, and any size, depending on the occasion.\nI've smoked the little joint, and it really is a fine smoke.  The Leafly report on the effects are spot on.  Nice, relaxed body, yet fully functional, as far as I am able to self observe.  I might add, \"mentality stimulating \", to my quiver of wonderment derived from the smoldering smoothness of this fine herb.\n",
