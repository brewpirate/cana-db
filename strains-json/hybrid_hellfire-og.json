First, it lifts you up and gives you nice burst of energy and motivation for about 20 to 25 minutes, almost like Green Crack or Moby Dick, and then it drops you on your ass on the couch like Master Kush or some kind of heavy Indica, and says \"stay!\"\n\nSo, it makes you super social and talkative, and then you just want everyone to go home so you can watch a movie. Great for doing chores after dinner or right before bed, and then you get to sit on you butt and chill. With that said, I think this a very strong strain with high THC, so I may have had a very different experience if I smoked more than I did. Don\u0027t think I\u0027d buy it again. Too much of roller coaster ride for me.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/YEN1LqXiYCOvWiFhmP-4p67iqDM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fY9fB9qHySLml8016ysgJ_goggles-green.png"},{"id":1602120,"username":"kernelcannabis420","text":"earthy and spicy I recommend for afternoon use","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3235","title":"New Strains Alert: Blueberry Jack, Hellfire OG, Double Tangie Banana, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1442592000000)\/","text":"The weekend is drawing near, which means it\u0027s just about time to kick back and relax with a bowl of your favorite strain.
