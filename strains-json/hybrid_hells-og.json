            "text": "This is my favorite sleepy time strain. Do NOT read that to mean it is ONLY good for sleeping. I enjoy it pretty much any time. But it turns my brain off and lets me relax. Let me explain that a little better...it turns off the constantly thinking, logical part of my brain (frontal lobe?) that keeps me awake all night because it won't shut the f up, and activates the creative parts of my brain (temporal lobes?) so I can go into receive mode and sit back and let my mind drift. To say I have trouble falling asleep is putting it mildly. On top of that, once I DO fall asleep, I usually wake up a couple hours later and can't get BACK to sleep making consistent, quality sleep very rare. And I refuse to take sleeping pills. This strain completely alleviates both types of insomnia for me. Yet it doesn't MAKE me fall asleep when I smoke it during the day. I vape almost exclusively (and hash oil, but I digress) and this strain is amazing for vaping. No worries of anxiety or paranoia. Great flavor. Does the job. I would buy this by the POUND! Is it weird I feel worried that I only have 2 ounces left? LOL!",
