To say I have trouble falling asleep is putting it mildly. On top of that, once I DO fall asleep, I usually wake up a couple hours later and can\u0027t get BACK to sleep making consistent, quality sleep very rare. And I refuse to take sleeping pills. This strain completely alleviates both types of insomnia for me. Yet it doesn\u0027t MAKE me fall asleep when I smoke it during the day. I vape almost exclusively (and hash oil, but I digress) and this strain is amazing for vaping. No worries of anxiety or paranoia. Great flavor. Does the job. I would buy this by the POUND! Is it weird I feel worried that I only have 2 ounces left? LOL!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"},{"id":1630790,"username":"DirtyIslandKidd","text":"wonderful flower,  taste is sweet and earthy. i would burn this and watch a comedy movie, goes great with the effects. also great for joint , back, and neck pain , has a good % c-mycene which is a natural acting pain reliever","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Pl-Y2_w7iIfXMq-susdCw64Abdk=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fZFL3vk8uSMmuki8G4w8c_old-school-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":154,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":44.81687727564789},{"name":"Flowery","score":34.986078389376736},{"name":"Sweet","score":23.356179053330475},{"name":"Woody","score":21.476761619190405},{"name":"Citrus","score":19.442064681944739}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":108.45470122081817},{"name":"Happy","score":91.261512101092308},{"name":"Euphoric","score":85.28592846433925},{"name":"Uplifted","score":52.8432212465196},{"name":"Sleepy","score":45.282715784964658}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":58.792032555150996},{"name":"Pain","score":46.385735703576785},{"name":"Depression","score":37.470550439066173},{"name":"Headaches","score":34.348896980081392},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":32.158920539730133}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":29.599485971300062},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":18.665667166416789},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":18.199828657100021},{"name":"Tinnitus","score":17.889269650888838},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":17.562647247804669}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":52.066823730991651},{"name":"Anxious","score":15.217391304347824},{"name":"Dizzy","score":4.0693938744913254},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.7080745341614907},{"name":"Headache","score":0.6211180124223602}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/hells-og/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/hells-og/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hell-s-angel-og_100x100_4134.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/641272/b/hell-s-angel-og__primary_a861.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hell-s-angel-og_100x100_8ab9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/608942/b/hell-s-angel-og__primary_8fef.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hell-s-angel-og_100x100_7394.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/594673/b/hell-s-angel-og__primary_06b9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hell-s-angel-og_100x100_ffbd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/587936/b/hell-s-angel-og__primary_6dd3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hell-s-angel-og_100x100_5af6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/561643/b/hell-s-angel-og__primary_d269.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hell-s-angel-og_100x100_4dec.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/559563/b/hell-s-angel-og__primary_c781.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":37,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Denver, CO","Eugene, OR","Las Vegas, NV","Aurora, CO","Boulder, CO","Glenwood Springs, CO","Salem, OR","Albany, OR","Bend, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/hells-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.51298701298701/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
