            "text": "This dreamy smoke is flying off the shelves in Oregon & I doubt High Noon can grow it fast enough.  Irish Cream's downtempo, relaxing effects are noticeably long-lasting. Great taste and aroma, with skunk/musk/spicy notes left on the palate after smoking.  Clean-burning, bright white ash on the joint.  Smooth draw, no coughing.\n\nThe 2018 batches of this strain test between 27.7% - 31.88% THC depending on the batch, making Irish Cream a  perfect choice for the distinguished smoker.  Otherwise, it's definitely important to ease into this one so as not to melt your face.\n\nIrish Cream's effects are particularly long-lasting.  While I generally feel the effects from a joint for about two hours, the same amount of Irish Cream flower produced effects lasting nearly twice as long, making this an exceptional strain for people like myself who treat chronic pain.",

One bowl of this Irish Cream and I feel like I'm lit for the first time again.  Very instense cerebral effects that are almost overwhelming (which I love) and slowly eases into a heavy body buzz. Amazing for muscle pain, stomach issues, and it helped rid my migraine! So rad! \ud83d\ude24 ",
