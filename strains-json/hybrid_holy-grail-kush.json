            "text": "Come one, come all, to witness the auspicious reading of August\u2019s Strain Review Hall of Fame! As summer drew to a close, Leafly reviewers were out in full force, regaling us with tales of cold fusion and divine yoga pants and dancing squids in space. Behold the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of August\u2019s strain reviews.\nXJ-13\nDoes your strain inspire full orchestral suites, complete with tiny dancers and exotic scents? If not, you\u2019re missing out.\u00a0\n\nWhen I open the jar to smell this XJ-13 it's almost as if little angels carrying baskets of citrus fruits are swirling past me, while a single pine tree stands center of the jar filled with peppermints, all the while a clan of gnomes lay below harvesting honey from the bee hives atop the pine tree\u2026 You get the picture.\n\nThin-Mint\nAnd to think, some people argue cannabis doesn\u2019t stimulate intellectualism.\n\nTook some of this to relax and ended up in a 30 minute debate with my wife about the political ramifications of sci-fi levels of discoveries, like cold fusion or first contact.\n\nGSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\nAnd on the 5th day God created\u2026 Yoga pants?\u00a0\n\nCannabis has many things to be proud of and this strain is it.. pretty sure Leafly was created on it.. god created yoga pants on it, the oceans grew, the gods bathe in it, its little waynes cologne\u2026 well maybe\n\nPurple Kush\nSome people like to consume and enjoy the munchies, other people like to become their munchies.\n\nI feel pretty good at the moment, I feel like tartar sauce and warm water or a stick of butter melting over a steamy hot cob of corn. And a biscuit with butter and peanut butter, and chicken, with olives on the side and a coke please. (:\u00a0\n\nNorthern Lights\nBut does it also make you feel like a cynical anthropomorphic octopus?\u00a0\n\nI feel like Squidward in space\n\nHoly Grail Kush\nEven the Knights who say \"Ni\" would have to agree that a strain which inspires poetry is fine indeed.\n\nYou'll laugh and you'll cry\u00a0\nBut you'll sure not die\u00a0\nBut now I'm in a cloud\u00a0\nBut my rain is dry.\u00a0\nugh he's so annoying.\n\nSuper Sour Diesel\nAre we talking a 5K or an Ironman?\n\nIt's not a dash right off sprinting type of weed but rather a walking-speedy walking-jogging- and then running weed. Super amazing once you get running.\n\nAmnesia Haze\nNot only does this strain deliver a tranquil high, it will nearly deliver you to any place your heart desires!\n\nWhen asked how I felt I said \"I feel like I\u2019m on a pebble of waterfalls\" and visualized a giant smooth white quartz pebble with waterfalls draining off the edge; it felt tranquil.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGreen Crack\nSometimes you just gotta shake yo\u2019 groove thang.\n\nI JUST WANNA DANCE YOU GUISE!!!111!!!\n\n\nWanted to Jam Out and Shake my Ass! #bam\u00a0\n\nphoto credit (cropped): roryrory via photopin cc",

            "text": "Ever since Pope Francis (n\u00e9e Jorge Mario Bergoglio) was elected to succeed Pope Benedict\u00a0XVI on March 13, 2013, the world has for the most part responded positively to His Holiness' behavior at the top of the religious food chain. As of December 2013, 88% of American Catholics approve of how he's handling his role as head of the Catholic church, and even non-religious people admire Pope Francis' humility, his vow to live simply, his acts of compassion, and his love for and acceptance of folks from all walks of life. Dude was even a bar bouncer and a janitor before becoming a priest. What's not to like about him?\u00a0\nWell, it turns out pope-in' ain't easy, and as much as I admire Pope Francis for being the pope-iest Pope to come along in decades, he holds one opinion that broke my little heathen heart. Last week, he condemned efforts to legalize cannabis, saying that limited attempts to legalize recreational drugs \"are not only highly questionable from a legislative standpoint, but they fail to produce the desired effects.\" He also added, \"the problem of drug use is not solved with drugs!\"\nPope Francis, I get where you're coming from. You've\u00a0previously spoken out against the evils\u00a0of drug addiction, so I can see how you'd be wary about cannabis legalization. However, cannabis is far less addictive (9-10%) than tobacco smokers (20%-30%), heroin users (23-25%), alcohol users (15%), and cocaine users (15%-20%), plus it has\u00a0therapeutic and medical benefits.\nMaybe you need a little bit of cannabis education, Mr. Pope. For instance, did you know that cannabis and religion often go hand-in-hand? It's true! As a matter of fact, I've got a list of nine strains that I think are right up your pious alley. Check out a few of these holy wonders and you'll see that cannabis isn't so bad, after all.\u00a0\n1. 3 Kings\nIn the biblical sense, the Three Kings, also known as the biblical Magi or the three Wise Men (not to be confused with the \"Ooohhhhh a wise guy, eh?\" schtick of the Three Stooges) were a trio of foreigners who visited Jesus after his birth. They brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh because they had no idea what sort of thing newborn babies are into (in hindsight, burping cloths and a Baby Bjorn would have probably been more ideal than pungent tree resin, though the gold was a classy touch).\nWhat better way to commemorate the birth of baby Jesus than with the hybrid 3 Kings strain, known for its appropriately piney, pungent smell and its euphoric, happy effects. Pair it with Dream Star to simulate the Star of Bethlehem and you've got yourself a pretty uplifting birthday celebration.\n2. Endless Sky\nIsn't heaven supposed to be some sort of Endless Sky where everyone lives on a fluffy cloud and gets free access to Backstreet Boys concerts? If so, let its indica counterpart bring you relaxation so you can dream about the day you get to meet your maker and high-five Him for inviting you through the pearly gates.\n3. Holy Grail Kush\nThe Holy Grail has had quite the heyday in pop culture, from Monty Python to Indiana Jones. There's no way you're not an Indiana Jones fan, Mr. Pope, so I strongly recommend you partake in this woody hybrid while commemorating the supposed vessel of the Last Supper with a viewing of the 1989 classic. Just know with Holy Grail Kush, you have chosen wisely.\n4. Jesus OG\nTry the indica named after Mr. JC himself, Jesus OG. Its citrus, earthy flavors and focused effects may channel the power of Christ to compel you to pair it with the hybrid Bio-Jesus, a euphoric hybrid that provides exceptional pain relief. That's double the Jesus in one session \u2014 think of it as hitting up church twice on the same Sunday.\n5. Soul Shine\nNot to be confused with Soul Glo (just let your soooooooooullllll glowwwwwwww!), Soul Shine is an arousing hybrid that will amplify your\u00a0love for the man upstairs. (Not the dude who lives in the apartment above yours, I mean the actual Man Upstairs.) As Pope, I imagine you've got one of the shiniest souls around, so this is a great option for someone with your sparkly innards.\n6. Lamb's Bread\nIn religious terms, lamb's bread is also known as sacramental bread, the body of Christ, altar bread, or Communion bread. It's used in the Christian ritual of the Eucharist/Holy Communion, where Christians accept a sacrament in the form of a piece of bread or cracker and a sip of wine or grape juice. In cannabis terms, Lamb's Bread is an earthy sativa that brings euphoric, uplifting, and creative effects. That sounds like a better Communion offering to me, don't you agree, Pope? Think of how much more amazing the church songs would be once the congregation gets their creative juices flowing (and we all know Christian hymns could use some oomph).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n7. Trinity\nThe Trinity in Christian terms describes God as three expressions: the\u00a0Father, the Son (aka Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. If God is a hybrid of these three, it's only fitting that the Trinity cannabis strain is also a hybrid (though I would hope God isn't as skunky-smelling). Try this one out for its trio of happy, uplifting, and energetic qualities and you'll think three is a magic number, indeed.\n8. Exodus Cheese\nThe Book of Exodus tells the story of Moses leading the\u00a0Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, where they wandered the desert for a ridiculous amount of time, subsisting on manna and miraculous water. They didn't even have any cheese, which to me is easily the biggest sacrifice (well, that and the whole \"wandering aimlessly through the dessert in search of a safe haven\" part). So pick up some of the hybrid Exodus Cheese, enjoy its sweet, cheesy flavors, and reflect on how thankful you are to eat cheese whenever you want instead of manna for the 40th day in a row (hopefully you're not\u00a0lactose\u00a0intolerant, Mr. Pope).\n9. God's Treat\n\u2026or God's Gift, or God Bud. Whatever your preference, know that a number of strains are named after The Big Guy because a lot of growers are thankful that one of His creations was this incredible plant with therapeutic purposes. So whaddya say, Pope Francis, why don't you pick up some hybrid God's Treat and acknowledge that there are many positive aspects of cannabis that benefit millions of people around the world? After all, it must be stressful to be Pope, and this Treat can deliver relaxing and sleepy effects to help you rest up so you can continue to spread your goodwill to those in need\u2026much how cannabis does. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

There's a sizzling all over your body that's tantalizing along with an awesomely encouraging thrill in your chest. The indica element brings a noticeable depth, distant headspace, and tangible weight on the top of your head - but it's never overbearing and always pleasant. Impossible to wipe the smile off your face :) Despite how strong the effects are, the high always remains \"easy\" without a lick of anxiety, edginess, or any sign that you could smoke too much. Music is utterly exquisite and captivating in a way that completely encompasses you. Wonderfully heightened arousal (again, both physically and mentally). Would work perfectly as an aphrodisiac.\n\nWhat a high quality high! Exploding with feel-good sensations, substantial gone-ness, and delightfully heightened senses. Holy Grail deserves a place in the top 5 (or 10) of all time.",

Smoke is not smooth but not harsh, definitely leaves a trail in the throat but it\u2019s tolerable.\nNugs are small and spade shaped with bright and pale green tones interleaved.\nThe high starts as a small click of energy in the head and spine which turns on full blast a few minutes later. At first it\u2019s intense but the relaxing body effects won\u2019t allow anxiety or paranoia.\nGrab a book or video game controller and head for a place to lay back and chill. This is stay put and enjoy your existence stuff, pleasant, utterly relaxing and never too overwhelming. A good first heavy strain for intermediate users to graduate from less potent strains.
