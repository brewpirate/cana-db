            "text": "For any cannabis aficionado, hearing the words \u201cHumboldt County\u201d can get the goosebumps going. One of the top cannabis producers in the Emerald Triangle\u2014reaching back to the 1960s and 70s\u2014Humboldt is known far and wide as the Napa Valley of weed; the place that produces the best quality outdoor cannabis in the entire country.\nBut while many connoisseurs have sampled its finest wares, Humboldt County has a lot more to offer than its incredible bud; it\u2019s also a natural paradise filled with gorgeous landscapes and stunning views. And now that California has finally gone recreational, exploring Humboldt County\u2014and all it has to offer\u2014has become one of the best cannabis-infused trips in the world.\n\nBursting with wild coastlines, pristine rivers, unique small towns, and towering stands of ancient redwoods, Humboldt County is a truly breathtaking experience.\nBelow, discover some incredible places to light up and enjoy one of California\u2019s greatest gems.\nPatrick\u2019s Point State Park\n(Redwood Coast/Flickr Creative Commons)\nThe dramatic meeting of land and sea that Humboldt County embodies is on full display at\u00a0Patrick\u2019s Point State Park\u2014a single square mile of lush forest teeters over the vast ocean on rugged rock promontories. Day hikes along the cliff edge offer fantastic views of raw Humboldt coastline, while inside the park a model Yurok village gives you a chance to explore daily indigenous life before European contact.\nCheck out Wedding Rock before you go, where countless couples have tied the knot backed by awe-inspiring panoramas of Agate Beach, where semi-precious stones lie hidden in the golden sands. Spark up a deliciously relaxing and euphoric strain, like Blueberry Muffins from Humboldt Seed Company, to take in this Eden-like paradise.\nThe Trinity River\n(CampPhoto/iStock)\nClear as glass and sparkling green, the living jewel known as the Trinity River winds its way out of the snowcapped Trinity Alps\u2014the highest point on California\u2019s coastal range. Locals flock here in the summertime to soak in high temperatures in this mountainous paradise. An hour inland from Eureka and Arcata, the town of Willow Creek is the center of activity here. Stop by\u00a0River Song Natural Foods (a great place to stock up on munchies before hitting the river), and check out a handful of white water rafting outfits around the area.\nCamp Kimtu, just outside Willow Creek, fronts multiple swimming holes and riverside camping while the South Fork of Trinity offers a crystalline paradise of natural pools and rocky edges. For something truly mind-blowing, head into the Hoopa Indian Reservation, the largest in the state, and check out Tish Tang. This native run campground and natural beach offers a spectacular backdrop of forest covered mountains at a picture-perfect bend in the shimmering river. End the day by massaging your tired muscles with Wipe Out Salve by Humboldt Marijuana Company before beginning another adventure in the clear waters.\n\nThe Manila Dunes\n(Redwood Coast/Flickr Creative Commons)\nThe narrow spits that separate the tranquil Humboldt Bay from the Pacific Ocean are home to eco-systems bursting with wildflowers. They seem to have been made just for whiling away the better part of a cannabis-infused afternoon.\nMake your way to the lookout point above the Manila community center for a panoramic view of the bay and the rolling redwood hills before meandering through the dunes and, finally, onto the wilderness beach. From here, it\u2019s a short trot over to the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center, a hobbit-hole like structure built right into the side of a massive sand dune that hosts a variety of educational exhibits for public enjoyment.\nThe Lost Coast\n(Redwood Coast/ Flickr Creative Commons)\nAn endless stretch of black sand beaches against a backdrop of rugged, ocean-worn mountains, the Lost Coast is the largest wilderness coastline on the west outside of Alaska. While the breathtaking Lost Coast Trail takes up to five days to hike\u2014weaving up and down the wind swept summits of the Kings Range to isolated beaches\u2014it is also possible to access the pristine coastline from the town of Shelter Cove, where you\u2019ll find the Black Sands Beach trailhead.\nAn incredible day hike is also possible at King\u2019s Peak, which offers dramatic 360\u00b0 views of the Lost Coast at 4,000 feet. Exploring the old farming communities of the Matolle Valley, a bastion of old school hippies and a center of cannabis fueled counter cultures via the Lost Coast Scenic Drive, makes for slow travel at its best. It boasts several stand-out swimming holes along the Matolle River made more spectacular with fresh fruit dipped in Humboldt Valley Farms\u2019 infused Chocolate Space Sauce.\n\nThe Humboldt Bay\n(shunyufan/iStock)\nThe largest protected body of water between San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound, Humboldt Bay is bookended by two unique towns\u2014the Victorian seaport of Eureka and the hip college town of Arcata. The bay is home to California sea lions, river otters, and other marine mammals as well as an abundance of avian species.\nFrom the Eureka side, you\u2019ll find the mural-peppered waterfront where Old Town reveals several stand-out small businesses worth patronizing. The Works record store, the palatial Eureka Books with its vast selection of local hiking and wildlife guides, and Humboldt Herbals, where you can stock up on natural, local products like Redwood Honey and talk to an herbalist about your medical marijuana regime.\nThe Victorian downtown area gives way to a bay-front promenade lined with benches, making it a wonderful place to spark up Bubba\u2019s Gift\u2014developed by Humboldt Seed Organization\u2014before taking in the views over the marina and the redwood carpeted hills in the background. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, kayaks and small sailboat rentals are available, while the 1930s-era Madaket Ferry offers daily sunset cocktail cruises which sets out from the Eureka boardwalk daily.\nIn Arcata, known far and wide for its dedication to all things eco-friendly, an innovative wastewater treatment program has transformed a tidal marsh into a bird sanctuary that offers sweeping views out over the Humboldt Bay.\nThe Arcata Community Forest\n(yhelfman/iStock)\nConsidered a \u201cmodel\u201d for ecological sustainability, Arcata\u2019s community owned forest blankets the hills just behind Humboldt State University, covering nearly 800 acres. Although you won\u2019t find the several thousand-year-old giants here that exist in nearby State and National Parks, you will enjoy the pleasant and well-kept trail system that let you get completely lost in nature just steps from downtown Arcata. Frisbee golfers have set up a world-class course within the community forest, and just below it\u2014in the grassy open space known as Redwood Park\u2014cannabis lovers gather to puff and pass all day long.\n\nGrizzly Creek Redwoods State Park\n(maislam/iStock)\nYou have to leave the tourist track and head up the rural Highway 36 into Humboldt\u2019s mountainous interior in order to reach Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park. It\u2019s a hidden gem where old growth forest surrounds the sapphire waters of the Van Duzen River. Fill a thermos of Kikoko\u2019s Positivi-Tea (made with Humboldt-grown bud) to lift the spirits as you travel through the woods and rivers.\nThis small but picture-perfect park is the ultimate place to shun reality in exchange for clear summer skies, hot swimming weather, and spectacular star-gazing through the forest canopy. While car-camping is available at the main entrance, there are several nicely clandestine camping sites located in the gorgeous groves just steps from the riverbank.",

            "text": "October\u2019s vicious Northern California wildfires, the deadliest and most damaging in US history, also dealt an unprecedented blow to California\u2019s emerging legal cannabis industry\u2014and at a crucial moment.\n\nIn addition to at least 43 deaths and the destruction of more than 8,900 homes and buildings, the fires\u2019 casualties included at least 47 legal marijuana farms, according to the most recent tally from the California Growers Association. Total damage to legal cannabis crops is now estimated at \u201c$60 million or greater,\u201d according to Hezekiah Allen, the association\u2019s executive director.\nAs much as 4% of the state\u2019s cannabis crop may be affected in some way, according to commonly accepted industry estimates.\nThat figure could rise as farms untouched by flames discover their crops are contaminated with toxic smoke, or as wholesalers find that their smoke-scented harvest\u2014which has earned nicknames like \u201ccampfire pot\u201d and \u201chickory kush\u201d\u2014is now worthless on an already saturated market. \u201cIs there benzene in that smoke? We just don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Allen said.\n\nBut as apocalyptic as the fires were for the farmers they touched,\u00a0as far as statewide marijuana prices are concerned, they may as well not have existed.\nThe fires simply aren\u2019t enough to disrupt a marketplace already drowning in biblical oversupply.\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect this fire to affect cannabis prices too much,\u201d said Mike Ray, CEO of Bloom Farms, a major cannabis oil producer. \u201cProduction is at an all-time high. That\u2019s going to be much more to blame for price elasticity than the fire.\u201d\n\nAnd while whatever impact the fires had on the statewide marijuana market has already been absorbed, farmers and analysts say, small and medium cannabis cultivators are still at serious risk of being driven out of business.\u00a0The real knockout blows to cannabis businesses have yet to come.\nRay, too, is a victim of a California wildfire. His family home and his company\u2019s farm both went up in flames during the 2015 Butte fire in Calaveras County, and he has yet to fully rebuild.\nThe recent fires will absolutely put some people out of business\u2014but cold, hard market forces will end the dreams of many more.\n\nIn 2016, the state\u2019s marijuana farmers produced as much as 13.5 million pounds of cannabis,\u00a0according to a study commissioned by the state Department of Food and Agriculture. That\u2019s five times more than California cannabis users consumed. The surplus exited the state to be sold on the black market at a higher price\u2014or worse, stayed put.\nThis year, industry observers are seeing more of the same\u2014literally. Last year\u2019s harvest is still coming into dispensaries for sale, and it\u2019s now competing for shelf space with the 2017 crop\u2014including the bounty from massive, investor-backed greenhouses.\n\u201cFrom what I saw before the fire, there was an awful lot of cannabis in the market,\u201d said\u00a0Andrew DeAngelo, the co-founder and director of operations at Oakland-based Harborside, the state\u2019s largest dispensary. \u201cLast year\u2019s crop was still coming into our shop and being offered to us before the fire\u2014and last year\u2019s crop is still coming into our shop and being offered to us, post-fire.\u201d\n\nHarborside sources about \u201cbetween 10 and 20%\u201d of its products from the wildfire-affected areas, DeAngelo said\u2014but the dispensary is also currently cultivating marijuana on a 47-acre former ivy topiary nursery in Monterey County.\nDespite the obvious oversupply,\u00a0many cannabis businesses are building bigger and bigger farms. Last week, California officials finally released the state\u2019s long-awaited regulations for the cannabis industry\u2014which include no limit on how many acres a cannabis cultivator can plant.\nCities, meanwhile, are generally keeping the number of retail stores steady, meaning most of California\u2019s marijuana harvest may never see a dispensary shelf.\n\nFor most sun-grown marijuana farmers new or old, prices are at an all-time low.\nHow low? While retail prices\u00a0have\u00a0remained\u00a0relatively stable\u00a0(so far), suppliers are reporting wholesale offers of $500 to $700 per pound for outdoor-grown flower\u2014if the crops are accepted at all.\nFor cannabis destined to be extracted into concentrates to fill vape cartridges or dab rigs, prices are even lower. $50 a pound isn\u2019t unheard of.\nFaced with such low profit margins\u2014as well as the choice of\u00a0either\u00a0selling product at a loss or trying to ship it out of state\u2014many small-to-medium marijuana entrepreneurs are calling it quits.\n\nThese growers generally don\u2019t have massive savings or any hope at investment from funders looking for pre-legalization\u2019s massive margins,\u00a0said Kevin Jodrey, a nursery owner and longtime cannabis cultivator based in Humboldt County.\n\u201cThis was a make-or-break year,\u201d he said.\nBut while wholesale prices continue to tumble and producers\u2019 livelihoods evaporate,\u00a0it\u2019s not clear consumers\u00a0will see much savings at all.\n\nThe state\u2019s marijuana market has yet to figure out how it will\u00a0react to\u00a0government regulations, which are poised to increase overhead for cannabis businesses and raise end prices for consumers. When state excise, cultivation, and state and local sales taxes are added tallied, the government\u2019s toll on California marijuana will be as high as 45 percent in some parts of the state,\u00a0according to a recent report by Fitch Ratings.\nThat doesn\u2019t include the cost of subjecting products to purity tests, which are shaping up to be the toughest in the nation and could be so costly that, at current estimates and prices, testing a pound of cannabis could be more expensive than buying one.\nAccording to an estimate from the state\u2019s official Bureau of Cannabis Control, lab testing will cost $407 per pound.\nSo while the recent fires won\u2019t cause prices to spike, more expensive cannabis is still coming.\n\u201cRetailers are paying less and less for cannabis than we did 10 years ago, but our costs to deliver that cannabis have gone up and up,\u201d DeAngelo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more expensive to do this legally. With the taxes going up from 0% to 35% just on the supply chain itself, I don\u2019t see how I can\u00a0not\u00a0raise prices.\u201d",
