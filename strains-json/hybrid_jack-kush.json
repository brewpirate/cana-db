            "text": "Found this in NJ and knocked me out. Killed the tremors, the pain, and brought back my appetite with a vengeance. Dry eyes and a headband/goggle effect is a price worth paying, though over-indulgence may lead to some slight spin/vertigo sensation. Made me a little jumpy at first through a bong but settled into a smooth and relaxed high which also killed the leg spasms. Vaped through a volcano at 210 degrees C twice with a regrind after bowl one was less jittery feeling. Both were social happy highs with friends around leading to in depth conversations about personal views and experiences. Leaves you feeling very open and comfortable. After everyone leaves, you're left with enough energy to make a meal, watch a show or film, maybe read a book. Smooth toward the end with a definite sleepy pull. Beautiful smell and flavor. Great for recreational or medical use depending on symptoms. Sleepiness may not be worth the vertigo from the amount needed to bring on a strong feeling of sleep rapidly, but if you need a strong anxiety med, something for the tremors, nerve pain, and muscle spasms (especially intercostal muscle spasms), I can say this helped me tremendously.",
