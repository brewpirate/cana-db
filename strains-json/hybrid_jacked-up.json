            "text": "Kind of have love/hate relationship with Jacked Up. Definitely arousing and creative. The ideas come fast and furious, along with the munchies. While stimulating creatively, this strain drops me into an introspective mood and I get way too engaged with my ideas/thinking, making it difficult to connect with my lover or other people. Might be a good one for solo pursuits (writing, music, video games, walking in nature) or with a friend hanging out, but not socially. Also, drops me into deep, restful sleep with no rebound effects later. Very similar to the strain \"Bruce Banner\".  ",
