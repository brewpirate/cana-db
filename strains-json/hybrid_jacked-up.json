Definitely arousing and creative. The ideas come fast and furious, along with the munchies. While stimulating creatively, this strain drops me into an introspective mood and I get way too engaged with my ideas/thinking, making it difficult to connect with my lover or other people. Might be a good one for solo pursuits (writing, music, video games, walking in nature) or with a friend hanging out, but not socially. Also, drops me into deep, restful sleep with no rebound effects later. Very similar to the strain \"Bruce Banner\".
