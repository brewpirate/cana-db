Don\u2019t be surprised if you get a mixture of these terpenes at varying degrees in your flower. I can really smell the Herer lineage and see its influence on Jackys Girl\u2019s appearance. But appearances may be deceiving and this girl has a bad side. I use this strain in moderation because it favors the effects that GSC is renown for. Often, I experience cannabis-induced vertigo from high doses of GSC (npi) but when used in moderation, I\u2019m definitely calm but lucid. Jackys Girl is a balanced hybrid. ",
