            "text": "Born in 1960s Jamaica, reggae was an evolution of its predecessors: ska and rocksteady. The genre quickly took on a life of its own and eventually made its way to the United States, where it became a staple of 1960s culture. It also carved a special niche in the cannabis world, since reggae\u2019s penchant for political lyrics did not shy away from the topic of legalization.\n\nIt\u2019s a genre that is powerful in both its unique sound and inherently political roots. It is music that uplifts the spirit and rallies the heart.\u00a0The era of reggae produced a plethora of iconic artists such as Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, The Abyssinians, and Toots & The Maytals\u2014the latter of whom actually coined the term \u2018reggae\u2019 with the 1968 single, \u201cDo The Reggay.\u201d\nTo better understand and appreciate the genre, pack a pipe, grab your friends, and explore the soulful reggae music below\u2014each album we suggest is an ideal match for the right cannabis strain.\nStony Hill by Damian Marley\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: King\u2019s Bread\nYoungest son of the legendary Bob Marley, Damian Marley continues his father\u2019s legacy in reggae with his own fresh sound. Stony Hill is Marley\u2019s newest album\u2014released in July of this year, it combines modern electronic elements with classic reggae beats. Stony Hill feels like the next modern step in a continuously growing genre that refuses to lose its heart along the way.\nIn true reggae style, Marley\u2019s lyrics do not shy away from telling honest and human stories. From wondering what the future will bring on one track, while impeccable backup vocals chime \u201cbelieve in your dreams\u201d on another, the album explores the depth of human character.\nThis 18-track album also features the song \u201cMedication\u201d featuring Marley\u2019s brother and guest artist, Stephen Marley. The song is an ode to Marley\u2019s love of \u201cMary Jane\u201d and the medicinal power of cannabis. You\u2019ll be singing along to the lyrics, \u201cAnd I say to myself, what a wonderful herb.\u201d\n\nSevana EP by Sevana\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Purple Bud\nHailing from Kingston, Jamaica, Sevana burst onto the scene last year with her first EP album, where she delivers stunning, expert vocals and impactful reggae beats. The album begins with the softer ballad \u201cCarry You\u201d before launching into the groovy \u201cBit Too Shy,\u201d which sets the tone for the rest of the collection.\nThe EP\u2019s music will get you moving to the rhythm, while Sevana\u2019s energetic and heartfelt vocals delight across the soundscape with perfect control and beautiful clarity. Sevana captures the heart of reggae in her music, vocals, and lyrics for a complete immersion in classic reggae via a modern recording artist. Sevana\u2019s debut album proves she\u2019s an artist to watch and gives us high hopes of more great albums to come.\nEqual Rights by Peter Tosh\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Jah Kush\nAlong with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh got his start as part of The Wailers. Afterwards, he went on to become his own successful solo artist and produced many iconic albums, including\u00a0Equal Rights\u00a0in 1977.\nEqual Rights opens with the familiar song, \u201cGet Up, Stand Up,\u201d performed with Tosh\u2019s unique style and sound. The album contains classics such as \u201cDownpressor Man\u201d and \u201cStepping Razor,\u201d and features Tosh\u2019s punctuated and mellow vocals accompanied by melodies that are rich, vibrant, and smooth.\nAs a whole, Equal Rights is an iconic reggae album that encapsulates the heart and soul of reggae as it was at the time of its initial emergence onto the popular scene. For this reason, it will always reign as a powerful memento of reggae\u2019s roots.\n\nAfrican Holocaust by Steel Pulse\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Malawi\nReleased in 2004, African Holocaust\u00a0is the latest in a long line of albums produced by Steel Pulse. Though over a decade old, it remains relevant today both musically as well as lyrically, touching on topics such as global warming, corruption in government and religion, and the ramifications of slavery.\nFormed in 1975 in Birmingham, England, Steel Pulse has had a somewhat rotating cast of players over the years, but always with lead singer David Hinds at the forefront holding down vocals and rhythm guitar.\nAfrican Holocaust is no exception, with Hinds\u2019s fierce voice leading the upbeat reggae melodies that encourage dance and reflection all at once. It is this combination of poignant lyrics and stunningly composed music full of drums and horns that makes\u00a0African Holocaust such a noteworthy album.\nRebirth by Jimmy Cliff\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lamb\u2019s Bread\nRebirth was released in 2012 as part of what Jimmy Cliff said was \u201ca rebirth of my career at this time.\u201d It was the first album Cliff had released in eight years, and went on to win a Grammy for Best Reggae Album. Cliff has been producing reggae music since the 1960s and is one of the few original artists who still produces new music today while touring or appearing at festivals (such as Lockn\u2019 in 2015).\nRebirth manages to encapsulate Cliff\u2019s classic reggae feel while shining anew with crisp, fresh, updated sounds. The 13-track album features new, original music as well as some covers\u2014all of it exceedingly lively, joyful, and brimming with energy.",

I have some serious anxiety and stress. this is one of the few strains that allows me to not have to take a full heavy dose of prescription medicine with painful side effects.  This strain is so awesome it gives a little bit of everything magical to it.  A hint of energy and a spark of euphoria.  The flavor is INTOXICATING its like a rich cheese and wine, so famously desirable.  when its on the shelf i am undoubtedly buying it all.\r\n\r\nIts a strain where I don't need to smoke anything extra or in addition to to get to my state of sanity.  Its a great strain one of my favorites. if you enjoy jah kush, you may enjoy blue cheese. ANOTHER favorite.",
