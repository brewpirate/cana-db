Jean Guy\nA fan favorite from our neighbors to the North (Canada, eh?), Jean Guy (pronounced “Jawn Gee”) is a sativa-dominant strain known for its high THC content and energizing effects. A great one to start your day cramp-free.\n 2. Hog\u0027s Breath\nHog’s Breath is a well-known indica with roots in the Kush landrace and is known for its potency against heavy pain and anxiety – a good strain to relax after a long work day.\n 3. Medicine Man\nMedicine Man lives up to its name by delivering potent pain relief with high levels of both THC and CBD. This medicinal strain is closely related to the master of the indica jungle – White Rhino.\n 4. Hash Plant\nHash Plant is known for an abundance of trichomes and a heavy body stone. This indica has a reputation for blissful euphoria, as well as easing pain and inflammation associated with Crohn’s and Colitis.\n 5. Willie Nelson\nWillie Nelson is named for the Red-Headed Stranger himself. This sativa offers a clear-headed, energetic high known to incite creativity, as well as a decent case of the munchies. \n 6. Chemo\nChemo is just as sedative as you might imagine – a heavy body high that’s perfect for chronic pain. Take note: the munchies are strong with this one. If you have stomach cramps or trouble eating, this strain will inspire your appetite.\n 7. Lemon Jack\nLemon Jack is born of the famed Jack Herer and Lemon Kush and offers strong psychoactive effects. Lemon Jack is a daytime strain as strong as a cup of coffee, but without the harsh stomach irritation. Recommended for users who suffer from fatigue.\n 8. Golden Pineapple\nGolden Pineapple is as delightful as it sounds. A hybrid cross that delivers uplifting, creative effects with a delicious fruity taste, it offers relief from stress and anxiety without causing fatigue.\n 9.

We’ve all experienced it: every flavor seems new, like you’re tasting it for the very first time. The less-than-average cook suddenly become a culinary genius—who knew granola, vanilla ice cream, and raspberry jam could be so good? Your stomach seems bottomless—did you really just eat a whole calzone and two slices of chocolate cake? \nThough some people may feel disgusted with themselves after a canna-induced feast, others revel in the pure satisfaction of a full stomach. Regardless of the bloat, we’d like to take the time to properly honor our favorite herb and our favorite pastime.\nSo, without further ado, here are three fun facts about cannabis and eating:   \n \n1. THC Makes Food Smell and Taste Better\n\nApparently, cannabis causes food to smell so good that you just have to eat it. A new study published by Nature Neuroscience has found that THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, stimulates the olfactory bulb, or the part of the brain responsible for recognizing scents. \nUsing mice as test subjects, researchers found that THC molecules fit nicely into receptors on the olfactory blub. The THC supercharged the smell-detecting ability of mice, enticing them to eat more food because the scent was simply irresistible.\n \n2. Cannabis Makes You Love the Experience of Eating\n\nAnother recent study published by Neuropharmacology found that cannabis may cause the relationship between you and your food to become a little more intimate. Eating foods that you like naturally increases dopamine, the pleasure hormone, in your body. Yet, when THC is present, your body receives an extra jolt of dopamine from what you’re eating. \nTHC’s ability to make you love your food even more than normal might be connected to the fact that the same compound also allows you to smell and taste food more acutely, meaning everything you taste becomes extra delicious and therefore all the more pleasurable.\n \n3. THC May Actually Stimulate Hunger\n\nSo far, we’ve learned that THC makes food smell better and more pleasurable to eat. Yet, to top things off, research published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) has found that the cannabinoid also increases ghrelin, one of the hormones responsible for creating the sensation of hunger that plays a part in the metabolization of carbohydrates. When THC is present in the body, levels of ghrelin increase, causing you to feel hungry and crave carbohydrate-rich substances. \nThe JBC study also found that cannabinoids, when bound to CB-1 receptors in the hypothalamus, increase activity levels of the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is the grandmaster for metabolic regulation. It\u0027s the enzyme that transforms glucose and fatty acids into forms that can be used for energy by cells. \nSimply stated: THC causes you to feel hungry by releasing hunger-hormones while simultaneously jump-starting your metabolism by stimulating AMPK.\nSpeaking of jump-starting your metabolism, if you\u0027re interested in pairing cannabis with some serious eating this weekend, here are some high THC strains you can try that\u0027ll get your tummy rumbling:\n\nG-13\nSuper Lemon Haze\nJean Guy\nOG Wreck\nStrawberry Cough\nAmnesia\nGodfather OG\nLarry OG\nJack Frost\n\nWell, there you have it. Marijuana and food are like two peas in a pod. After a little cannabis, food tastes better, eating brings you more pleasure, and THC helps your body rev up for a massive chow-down. What\u0027s not to love?\n\nLearn more about the science behind \"the munchies\" and why cannabis stimulates your appetite:\n\nPhoto credits: ArmandoH2O; thebittenword.com; Tabsinthe; Chacon Foto Photography By Rafael Chacon via photopin cc","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/29200215/3-fun-facts-about-cannabis-and-eating.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/3-fun-facts-about-cannabis-and-eating"}],"reviewCount":235,"flavors":[{"name":"Lemon","score":9.8006644518272417},{"name":"Citrus","score":8.9977851605758588},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":5.2602436323366559},{"name":"Earthy","score":4.7065337763012183},{"name":"Pine","score":3.8759689922480618}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":26.633444075304539},{"name":"Happy","score":24.003322259136212},{"name":"Uplifted","score":23.837209302325583},{"name":"Energetic","score":19.130675526024362},{"name":"Creative","score":15.83610188261351}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":12.153931339977852},{"name":"Pain","score":9.9114064230343288},{"name":"Fatigue","score":7.83499446290144},{"name":"Depression","score":6.6168327796234774},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":4.2081949058693251}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":6.6168327796234774},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":3.6267995570321152},{"name":"Migraines","score":3.5437430786267994},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":2.9623477297895904},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":2.7962347729789592}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":14.036544850498338},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":4.9003322259136217},{"name":"Paranoid","score":4.0420819490586934},{"name":"Headache","score":3.2945736434108528},{"name":"Anxious","score":3.211517165005537}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/jean-guy/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/jean-guy/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jean-guy_100x100_a5f8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/637772/b/jean-guy__primary_b6cf.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jean-guy_100x100_4f87.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/598160/b/jean-guy__primary_cb92.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jean-guy_100x100_e1c1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/588310/b/jean-guy__primary_e5f1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jean-guy_100x100_3767.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/579085/b/jean-guy__primary_1882.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jean-guy_100x100_21da.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/578283/b/jean-guy__primary_e765.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jean-guy_100x100_2901.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/555990/b/jean-guy__primary_6117.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":62,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/jean-guy","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.4468085106383/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"White Widow","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-widow","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow","symbol":"Ww","applink":"leafly://strain/white-widow"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Yet, to top things off, research published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) has found that the cannabinoid also increases ghrelin, one of the hormones responsible for creating the sensation of hunger that plays a part in the metabolization of carbohydrates. When THC is present in the body, levels of ghrelin increase, causing you to feel hungry and crave carbohydrate-rich substances. \nThe JBC study also found that cannabinoids, when bound to CB-1 receptors in the hypothalamus, increase activity levels of the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is the grandmaster for metabolic regulation. It\u0027s the enzyme that transforms glucose and fatty acids into forms that can be used for energy by cells. \nSimply stated: THC causes you to feel hungry by releasing hunger-hormones while simultaneously jump-starting your metabolism by stimulating AMPK.\nSpeaking of jump-starting your metabolism, if you\u0027re interested in pairing cannabis with some serious eating this weekend, here are some high THC strains you can try that\u0027ll get your tummy rumbling:\n\nG-13\nSuper Lemon Haze\nJean Guy\nOG Wreck\nStrawberry Cough\nAmnesia\nGodfather OG\nLarry OG\nJack Frost\n\nWell, there you have it.

Jean Guy\nA fan favorite from our neighbors to the North (Canada, eh?), Jean Guy (pronounced “Jawn Gee”) is a sativa-dominant strain known for its high THC content and energizing effects. A great one to start your day cramp-free.\n 2. Hog\u0027s Breath\nHog’s Breath is a well-known indica with roots in the Kush landrace and is known for its potency against heavy pain and anxiety – a good strain to relax after a long work day.\n 3. Medicine Man\nMedicine Man lives up to its name by delivering potent pain relief with high levels of both THC and CBD. This medicinal strain is closely related to the master of the indica jungle – White Rhino.\n 4. Hash Plant\nHash Plant is known for an abundance of trichomes and a heavy body stone. This indica has a reputation for blissful euphoria, as well as easing pain and inflammation associated with Crohn’s and Colitis.\n 5. Willie Nelson\nWillie Nelson is named for the Red-Headed Stranger himself. This sativa offers a clear-headed, energetic high known to incite creativity, as well as a decent case of the munchies. \n 6. Chemo\nChemo is just as sedative as you might imagine – a heavy body high that’s perfect for chronic pain. Take note: the munchies are strong with this one. If you have stomach cramps or trouble eating, this strain will inspire your appetite.\n 7. Lemon Jack\nLemon Jack is born of the famed Jack Herer and Lemon Kush and offers strong psychoactive effects. Lemon Jack is a daytime strain as strong as a cup of coffee, but without the harsh stomach irritation. Recommended for users who suffer from fatigue.\n 8. Golden Pineapple\nGolden Pineapple is as delightful as it sounds. A hybrid cross that delivers uplifting, creative effects with a delicious fruity taste, it offers relief from stress and anxiety without causing fatigue.\n 9. Confidential Cheese\nConfidential Cheese is born of the legendary LA Confidential and Exodus Cheese. It offers powerful pain relief, as well as relief from insomnia. Great for winding down before bedtime, Confidential Cheese also subdues painful muscle spasms and cramps.\n 10. K2\nK2 is named for the world’s second highest mountain peak, which makes sense, as it comes from two of the greats – White Widow and Hindu Kush. K2 is known to increase appetite and calm nausea without any sedative sleepy effects, making it a great strain for both daytime and evening use.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002927/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis"},{"id":"contentitems-6219","title":"3 Fun Facts About Cannabis and Eating","author":"Anna Wilcox","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1392915600000)\/","text":"If there’s one activity that is truly made better by cannabis, it’s eating. We’ve all experienced it: every flavor seems new, like you’re tasting it for the very first time. The less-than-average cook suddenly become a culinary genius—who knew granola, vanilla ice cream, and raspberry jam could be so good? Your stomach seems bottomless—did you really just eat a whole calzone and two slices of chocolate cake? \nThough some people may feel disgusted with themselves after a canna-induced feast, others revel in the pure satisfaction of a full stomach. Regardless of the bloat, we’d like to take the time to properly honor our favorite herb and our favorite pastime.\nSo, without further ado, here are three fun facts about cannabis and eating:   \n \n1. THC Makes Food Smell and Taste Better\n\nApparently, cannabis causes food to smell so good that you just have to eat it. A new study published by Nature Neuroscience has found that THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, stimulates the olfactory bulb, or the part of the brain responsible for recognizing scents. \nUsing mice as test subjects, researchers found that THC molecules fit nicely into receptors on the olfactory blub. The THC supercharged the smell-detecting ability of mice, enticing them to eat more food because the scent was simply irresistible.\n \n2. Cannabis Makes You Love the Experience of Eating\n\nAnother recent study published by Neuropharmacology found that cannabis may cause the relationship between you and your food to become a little more intimate. Eating foods that you like naturally increases dopamine, the pleasure hormone, in your body. Yet, when THC is present, your body receives an extra jolt of dopamine from what you’re eating. \nTHC’s ability to make you love your food even more than normal might be connected to the fact that the same compound also allows you to smell and taste food more acutely, meaning everything you taste becomes extra delicious and therefore all the more pleasurable.\n \n3. THC May Actually Stimulate Hunger\n\nSo far, we’ve learned that THC makes food smell better and more pleasurable to eat.

When THC is present in the body, levels of ghrelin increase, causing you to feel hungry and crave carbohydrate-rich substances. \nThe JBC study also found that cannabinoids, when bound to CB-1 receptors in the hypothalamus, increase activity levels of the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is the grandmaster for metabolic regulation. It\u0027s the enzyme that transforms glucose and fatty acids into forms that can be used for energy by cells. \nSimply stated: THC causes you to feel hungry by releasing hunger-hormones while simultaneously jump-starting your metabolism by stimulating AMPK.\nSpeaking of jump-starting your metabolism, if you\u0027re interested in pairing cannabis with some serious eating this weekend, here are some high THC strains you can try that\u0027ll get your tummy rumbling:\n\nG-13\nSuper Lemon Haze\nJean Guy\nOG Wreck\nStrawberry Cough\nAmnesia\nGodfather OG\nLarry OG\nJack Frost\n\nWell, there you have it. Marijuana and food are like two peas in a pod. After a little cannabis, food tastes better, eating brings you more pleasure, and THC helps your body rev up for a massive chow-down.
