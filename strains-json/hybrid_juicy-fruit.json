What?\" The Leafly Strain Review Hall of Fame has made its glorious comeback to celebrate the very best of your cannabis-fueled quirkiness. Yes, we take elevating the cannabis conversation seriously and we want to show the world that the cannabis community is comprised of mature, responsible individuals…but we can all share a harmless chuckle every once in a while, too.\nSo sit back, grab your favorite strain, and marvel at the amazing(ly hilarious) places our minds can sometimes go with a little help from our green friend. \n   Purple Haze\nFrom the producers that brought you Hermit Crab Hotbox comes the true story of a lost adventurer and his unlikely crawdad friend. A compelling tale of love and loss.\n\nTook me from down in the dumps to having a cool time. Went on an adventure and found a crawdad. I subsequently made friends with said crawdad and hung out with him. Man I miss Craymond.\n\n   XJ-13\nBecause butts are funny.\n\nAt one point i had tingling feelings in my butt. Great for hanging out.\n\n   Pure Power Plant\nYikes. At least Pure Power Plant was nice. (Also, we hope the scorpion made bail.)\n\nUsually when I get stung by a scorpion, I capture them and make them kill themselves by circling them with lighter fluid and then lighting it so they sting themselves in the back. Smoking pure power plant helped me to understand that scorpions aren\u0027t inherently aggressive creatures, they\u0027re just defending themselves according to their genetic patterns. I took him out to a field behind my house and was going to let him go but a cop stopped me and arrested me due to a warrant and now he\u0027s sitting in a small jar with my other personal belongings at the county jail pending my trial date next month :/ Pure power plant was nice.\n\n   Juicy Fruit\nThree profound questions that we may never have the answers to. May Juicy Fruit one day help us unlock these mysteries.\n\nJesus…is he real…will we ever be able to see…how the kids see the taste of cinnamon toast crunch…or are frosted flakes better\n\n   Master Jedi\nFriends are there to love and support you, to pick you up off the ground when the going gets rough. And to point out when you\u0027re unable to accurately interpret reality.\n\nThis got me so high that I was convinced that the street light outside my house was the moon. Luckily my friend pointed out that \"that\u0027s no moon.\"\n\n   Afghan Kush\nI would judge, except I think we\u0027ve all been that guy with a dog bed hat at some point in our lives.\n\nSmoked this shit and I was walking in tunnels made of rainbows and then proceeded to have a chocolate bar fight while wearing dog beds as hats in a London [drugstore]\n\n   Purple Trainwreck\n\"The greatest pillow fort in all the land.\"\n\nI learned how to make the greatest pillow fort in all the land. No girls allowed, just me and my dog Jack (to be fair he came up with the password so I had to let him in).\n\n   Green Crack\nBecause no one has ever described the munchies better than this wordsmith.\n\nI get really hungry every time I smoke this. Like really hungry. Like whole left side of the taco bell menu hungry.\n\n   Maui Waui\nSome feats just deserve an entire chicken\u0027s worth of credit.\n\nSmoked a bowl of this and got inspired enough to clean my entire house. I felt incredibly accomplished and rewarded myself by eating a whole chicken.\n\n   Platinum Bubba Kush\nToday\u0027s lesson in sharing is brought to you by Platinum Bubba and the color purple.\n\nGreat floral taste and some of the strongest munchies ever. While we were on this strain, my friend asked if he could have some of the pizza I was making and I said no. I realized later that my munchies were so strong that I was not thinking rationally and of course split the pizza with him…and another. Make sure you have some Red Baron pizzas standing by in the freezer.\n\nPhoto credit: Kevin O\u0027Mara via Flickr CC","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12002845/the-leafly-strain-review-hall-of-fame-we-miss-craymond-too.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/the-leafly-strain-review-hall-of-fame-we-miss-craymond-too"},{"id":"contentitems-36025","title":"Tips for Growing Juicy Fruit Cannabis","author":"Leafly Staff","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1501546083000)\/","text":"Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and General Hydroponics are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Juicy Fruit was created by Sensi Seeds, who crossed landrace strains from Afghanistan and Thailand. The aroma is sweet and tropical as the name indicates, and its effects are well-balanced and bright, imbuing the consumer with blissful happiness.\nGrow Techniques: Grow Juicy Fruit in soil indoors or outdoors. The plant expresses attributes of both indicas and sativas; its branches and buds are long and lanky, but the leaves are broad. Training this plant helps keep an even canopy, and topping will encourage more colas to develop in flowering. Though the branches are generally thick, keep the stalks supported as they can develop large buds. \nFlowering Time: 7 to 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate \nClimate: Juicy Fruit thrives in a Mediterranean climate between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This strain can handle slightly higher humidity levels.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Can be grown both indoors and outdoors, but consider growing it outside if you are in the right climate. This plant will take off and produce huge yields if given enough space.\nFeeding: Keep a basic feeding schedule with Juicy Fruit and observe how it responds. Using bloom nutrients in flowering can help the buds pack on density and weight.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/31170405/juicy-fruit-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-juicy-fruit-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":556,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":25.926279602750192},{"name":"Citrus","score":13.480392156862745},{"name":"Tropical","score":11.70581869111281},{"name":"Flowery","score":6.27864782276547},{"name":"Earthy","score":5.829831932773109}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":70.559587471352174},{"name":"Happy","score":65.040106951871664},{"name":"Relaxed","score":62.267634326457859},{"name":"Uplifted","score":60.663356251591551},{"name":"Hungry","score":39.643812070282657}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":23.341609371021136},{"name":"Depression","score":19.700152788388081},{"name":"Pain","score":12.143493761140819},{"name":"Headaches","score":11.163101604278076},{"name":"Nausea","score":10.042653425006366}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":20.050292844410492},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":12.767379679144387},{"name":"PTSD","score":11.38432645785587},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":5.7184237331296162},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":4.9306086070791961}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":40.455500381970971},{"name":"Dizzy","score":33.050038197097017},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":19.455054749172394},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.9586834733893554},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.4859943977591037}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/juicy-fruit/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/juicy-fruit/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/juicy-fruit_100x100_e8e1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1006185/b/juicy-fruit__primary_abf9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/juicy-fruit_100x100_c5de.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002473/b/juicy-fruit__primary_578e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/juicy-fruit_100x100_f683.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/651914/b/juicy-fruit__primary_575f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/juicy-fruit_100x100_d62a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/637553/b/juicy-fruit__primary_a5e5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/juicy-fruit_100x100_ea49.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/604587/b/juicy-fruit__primary_b14d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/juicy-fruit_100x100_a3a2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/589804/b/juicy-fruit__primary_5b3e.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":127,"popularCities":["Denver, CO","Toronto, ON","Montréal, QC","Portland, OR","Vancouver, BC","Calgary, AB","Edmonton, AB","Las Vegas, NV","Medford, OR","Seattle, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/juicy-fruit","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.13848920863309/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"},{"name":"Thai","subtitle":null,"slug":"thai","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/thai","symbol":"Tha","applink":"leafly://strain/thai"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":59,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tSuitable for sea of green (SOG)\n\tMay express compact\u0026nbsp;indica or tall sativa phenotypes\n\n"}}
