            "text": "probably in my top 3 of all time..very smooth flavor and draw from the bong with no coughing.. i agree with the other reviewer - this is a very different strain from what you might be accustomed to smoking. And that's a good thing-not bad.  For me Juliet makes me feel extremely happy and focused. Seems to be great for social situations because you don't get that paranoia creep that some other sativa dominants provide. Just a feeling of bliss and euphoria. Would like to smoke a bowl of this on Saturday morning with a strong coffee and  followed by a bowl of Blue Dream, which for me provides a \"get shit done\" mindset and helps me knock out my honey do list..",

If you want to be energized, focused, and productive, it\u2019s perfect for that as well. The high I received from this is very controlled, depending on how I want to feel at the time. This helps with pain relief and makes me feel happy. Only cons for me is I get a headache afterwards and dry mouth. ",
