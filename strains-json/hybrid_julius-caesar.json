The smoke does expand in the lungs, it comes out thick, the smoke is very smooth and not harsh on the troat at all,The high comes on very fast, it is very strong! do not plan to smoke this before work, you will not be able to function that way, it makes you very spaced out in the head!! I love Master Kush alone and this strain has the intense body super strong spacey high i love. \n\n The only Con about this is that it makes you extremely hungry when you are coming down, you will eat allot! Also, makes you very tired body wise , excellent to take a nap or sleep after.\n\nTop 3 of my choice.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1588197,"username":"skyraines","text":"This strain has every thing going for it; the potency, the aroma, and the uniqueness.\n\nI picked up a half gram of shatter from Nature\u0027s Medicines in Phoenix, best $15 I have ever spent. However it\u0027s that kind of shatter where it\u0027s brittle \u0026 hard to stick to the dab tool. You can\u0027t even squeeze it into a little ball it just breaks down into almost chunks of sugar. Despite that down side this stuff is so potent I only need a dab or two and I\u0027m good for at least 2 hours.\n Normally with other strains I have to do several dabs per hour to feel medical relief.\n\nIf only Julius had some of this he wouldn\u0027t have been killed.
