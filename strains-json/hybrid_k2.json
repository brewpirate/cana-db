But when more and more people began suffering side effects (which in some cases led to death), concerns arose over synthetic cannabis, a designer drug made for those who prefer health risks to legal risks – or for those blind to the risks altogether.\nWhat is Synthetic Cannabis?\n\nNot to be confused with legal synthetic THC like Marinol, this cannabis doppelganger is anything but FDA-approved. Synthetic cannabis (also called synthetic cannabinds, SCs, or synncanns) hides under many monikers like K2 and Spice, as well as a label which reads “Not for human consumption.” New varieties are introduced with shuffled ingredients as a way of maintaining their legality. These products would sit inconspicuously on the shelves of smoke shops and gas stations, and of course the internet offered an even broader selection of products.\n\nA synthetic cannabinoid is not a cannabis product, but a chemical analog that binds to the same system of receptors. THC, the primary psychoactive chemical in herbal cannabis, latches to CB1 receptors in the brain to produce a euphoric high, and synthetic cannabinoids also bind here, but with a much higher affinity.\nSynthetic cannabinoids can be 2 to 100 times more potent than THC and induce severe side effects like vomiting, chest pain, increased heart rate, vision blackouts, headaches, kidney damage, agitation, high blood pressure, and psychosis. Significant withdrawal symptoms have also been reported.\nJohn William Huffman, a Harvard graduate and organic chemistry professor at Clemson University, began synthesizing hundreds of novel cannabinoids in the mid-1980s for medical research purposes using funding from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA). They were intended as tools for understanding cannabinoid mechanisms, but in 2008 following the publication of his work, one cannabinoid called JWH-018 appeared thousands of miles away in a German forensic lab. They named it “Spice” and disseminated it to curious, experimentally-inclined customers.\nSimple to manufacture with a remarkably short turnaround time, it didn’t take long for clandestine drug manufacturers to jump on the opportunity and open the market floodgates. Huffman’s response: “Someone opened Pandora’s box.”\nHow to Make Synthetic Cannabinoid Blends\n\nSynthetic cannabinoids are typically shipped overseas from China to manufacturers who prepare the blends using high-proof alcohol or acetone solvents. It’s basically a reverse-extraction: the synthetic molecules are dissolved in a solvent and introduced to its plantlike host material through a soaking or spraying process.\nMuch can go wrong in the production process. A poorly mixed solution or an uneven spray job can result in chemical “hot spots,” or dangerously potent areas of the batch. The unlucky customer who happens to buy a bag with this concentrated chemical hot spot is likely to experience some pretty terrible side effects.\n\nYou can use your imagination to come up with tons of other production errors, especially in the hands of unexperienced or careless manufacturers. Is your novel cannabinoid source reliable? Is your potency analysis accurate? Is it actually the cannabinoid you think it is?\nWhile the DEA chases down large-scale operations, small operations sell their questionable products under established “brand” names. Without a system of regulation, it’s anyone’s guess how a product was made, what ingredients went into it, and what potency each batch exhibits.\nAll of these uncertainties are contributors to the dangerous side effects and even deaths from synthetic cannabis. So why are people turning to it despite its dangers?\nSimple. People typically choose synthetic cannabis over real cannabis for the following reasons:\n\nCannabis is illegal in their state\nSynthetic cannabinoids don’t turn up on a urine analysis\n\nUnfortunately, these short-sighted “advantages” aren’t worth the risk of death or serious side effects that can compromise your health. The success of these life-threatening products rides the wave of cannabis prohibition. It’s yet another reason to keep fighting the good fight for legalization.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/29195241/what-is-synthetic-marijuana-and-why-is-it-dangerous.jpg","urlslug":"/news/cannabis-101/what-is-synthetic-marijuana-and-why-is-it-dangerous"},{"id":"contentitems-3589","title":"Top 10 Strains to Combat Crohn’s Disease and Colitis","author":"Lisa Rough","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1417562220000)\/","text":"This week is Crohn’s Disease and Colitis Awareness week. For those of you that don’t know, Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are gastrointestinal disorders in a group of conditions known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\nCrohn’s Disease is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the rectum, although it may skip certain areas of the intestine, leaving some healthy, while other parts suffer. Ulcerative Colitis is a very similar disease in the IBD group of disorders, but it only affects the colon, affecting only the innermost lining of the colon. \nThe telltale symptoms of Crohn’s Disease:\n\nPersistent diarrhea\nRectal bleeding\nAbdominal pain and cramps\nConstipation\nUrgent need to move bowels\nSensation of incomplete evacuation or “rectal tenesmus” (Hey, you learned a new word!)\n\nOther signs that are associated with IBD:\n\nFever\nLoss of appetite\nWeight loss\nFatigue\nNight sweats\nLoss of menstrual cycle in women\n\nSounds terrible, doesn’t it? These are painful, life-altering disorders, which is why Crohn’s Disease and Colitis are specified as qualifying conditions for medical cannabis in nearly half of all medical marijuana states.\nThese symptoms can be controlled somewhat through diet, but often cannabis offers some of the best relief for the most severe symptoms – cramps, nausea, loss of appetite, etc.\nWithout further ado, in honor of Crohn’s Disease and Colitis Awareness Week, here are the top strains for your symptoms:\n 1. Jean Guy\nA fan favorite from our neighbors to the North (Canada, eh?), Jean Guy (pronounced “Jawn Gee”) is a sativa-dominant strain known for its high THC content and energizing effects. A great one to start your day cramp-free.\n 2. Hog\u0027s Breath\nHog’s Breath is a well-known indica with roots in the Kush landrace and is known for its potency against heavy pain and anxiety – a good strain to relax after a long work day.\n 3. Medicine Man\nMedicine Man lives up to its name by delivering potent pain relief with high levels of both THC and CBD. This medicinal strain is closely related to the master of the indica jungle – White Rhino.\n 4. Hash Plant\nHash Plant is known for an abundance of trichomes and a heavy body stone. This indica has a reputation for blissful euphoria, as well as easing pain and inflammation associated with Crohn’s and Colitis.\n 5. Willie Nelson\nWillie Nelson is named for the Red-Headed Stranger himself. This sativa offers a clear-headed, energetic high known to incite creativity, as well as a decent case of the munchies. \n 6. Chemo\nChemo is just as sedative as you might imagine – a heavy body high that’s perfect for chronic pain. Take note: the munchies are strong with this one. If you have stomach cramps or trouble eating, this strain will inspire your appetite.\n 7. Lemon Jack\nLemon Jack is born of the famed Jack Herer and Lemon Kush and offers strong psychoactive effects. Lemon Jack is a daytime strain as strong as a cup of coffee, but without the harsh stomach irritation. Recommended for users who suffer from fatigue.\n 8. Golden Pineapple\nGolden Pineapple is as delightful as it sounds. A hybrid cross that delivers uplifting, creative effects with a delicious fruity taste, it offers relief from stress and anxiety without causing fatigue.\n 9. Confidential Cheese\nConfidential Cheese is born of the legendary LA Confidential and Exodus Cheese. It offers powerful pain relief, as well as relief from insomnia. Great for winding down before bedtime, Confidential Cheese also subdues painful muscle spasms and cramps.\n 10. K2\nK2 is named for the world’s second highest mountain peak, which makes sense, as it comes from two of the greats – White Widow and Hindu Kush. K2 is known to increase appetite and calm nausea without any sedative sleepy effects, making it a great strain for both daytime and evening use.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002927/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis"}],"reviewCount":40,"flavors":[{"name":"Woody","score":112.40384615384616},{"name":"Earthy","score":22.884615384615383},{"name":"Sweet","score":11.442307692307692},{"name":"Citrus","score":11.442307692307692},{"name":"Flowery","score":10.961538461538462}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":138.17307692307693},{"name":"Happy","score":37.21153846153846},{"name":"Hungry","score":23.365384615384617},{"name":"Giggly","score":21.442307692307693},{"name":"Sleepy","score":11.923076923076923}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":104.80769230769231},{"name":"Pain","score":103.36538461538461},{"name":"Nausea","score":11.442307692307692},{"name":"Cramps","score":10.961538461538462},{"name":"Headaches","score":10}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":12.403846153846153},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":10.961538461538462},{"name":"Anxiety","score":1.9230769230769231},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.4423076923076923},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":0.96153846153846156}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":112.40384615384616},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":12.403846153846153},{"name":"Dizzy","score":10.961538461538462},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.4423076923076923},{"name":"Headache","score":0.48076923076923078}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_4143.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/627054/b/k2__primary_e5c6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_5d46.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/588410/b/k2__primary_157c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_2e7a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/509817/b/k2__primary_65c5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_4c4d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/442615/b/k2__primary_f4dd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_8486.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/426891/b/k2__primary_7401.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_acb7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/408748/b/k2__primary_1554.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":10,"popularCities":["Blanca, CO","Frisco, CO","Moffat, CO","Pueblo West, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/k2","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.025/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Hindu Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"hindu-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush","symbol":"Hk","applink":"leafly://strain/hindu-kush"},{"name":"White Widow","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-widow","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow","symbol":"Ww","applink":"leafly://strain/white-widow"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":"Hydro","floweringDays":56,"outdoorFinish":"End of September","height":"Short","averageYield":"Medium","environment":"Indoor","growNotes":"\n\tCompact plant that forms tight buds\n\tIdeal for\u0026nbsp;Sea of Green (SOG) method or when space is limited\n\tPromising yeilds\n\n"}}

But when more and more people began suffering side effects (which in some cases led to death), concerns arose over synthetic cannabis, a designer drug made for those who prefer health risks to legal risks – or for those blind to the risks altogether.\nWhat is Synthetic Cannabis?\n\nNot to be confused with legal synthetic THC like Marinol, this cannabis doppelganger is anything but FDA-approved. Synthetic cannabis (also called synthetic cannabinds, SCs, or synncanns) hides under many monikers like K2 and Spice, as well as a label which reads “Not for human consumption.” New varieties are introduced with shuffled ingredients as a way of maintaining their legality. These products would sit inconspicuously on the shelves of smoke shops and gas stations, and of course the internet offered an even broader selection of products.\n\nA synthetic cannabinoid is not a cannabis product, but a chemical analog that binds to the same system of receptors. THC, the primary psychoactive chemical in herbal cannabis, latches to CB1 receptors in the brain to produce a euphoric high, and synthetic cannabinoids also bind here, but with a much higher affinity.\nSynthetic cannabinoids can be 2 to 100 times more potent than THC and induce severe side effects like vomiting, chest pain, increased heart rate, vision blackouts, headaches, kidney damage, agitation, high blood pressure, and psychosis. Significant withdrawal symptoms have also been reported.\nJohn William Huffman, a Harvard graduate and organic chemistry professor at Clemson University, began synthesizing hundreds of novel cannabinoids in the mid-1980s for medical research purposes using funding from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA). They were intended as tools for understanding cannabinoid mechanisms, but in 2008 following the publication of his work, one cannabinoid called JWH-018 appeared thousands of miles away in a German forensic lab. They named it “Spice” and disseminated it to curious, experimentally-inclined customers.\nSimple to manufacture with a remarkably short turnaround time, it didn’t take long for clandestine drug manufacturers to jump on the opportunity and open the market floodgates. Huffman’s response: “Someone opened Pandora’s box.”\nHow to Make Synthetic Cannabinoid Blends\n\nSynthetic cannabinoids are typically shipped overseas from China to manufacturers who prepare the blends using high-proof alcohol or acetone solvents. It’s basically a reverse-extraction: the synthetic molecules are dissolved in a solvent and introduced to its plantlike host material through a soaking or spraying process.\nMuch can go wrong in the production process. A poorly mixed solution or an uneven spray job can result in chemical “hot spots,” or dangerously potent areas of the batch. The unlucky customer who happens to buy a bag with this concentrated chemical hot spot is likely to experience some pretty terrible side effects.\n\nYou can use your imagination to come up with tons of other production errors, especially in the hands of unexperienced or careless manufacturers. Is your novel cannabinoid source reliable? Is your potency analysis accurate? Is it actually the cannabinoid you think it is?\nWhile the DEA chases down large-scale operations, small operations sell their questionable products under established “brand” names. Without a system of regulation, it’s anyone’s guess how a product was made, what ingredients went into it, and what potency each batch exhibits.\nAll of these uncertainties are contributors to the dangerous side effects and even deaths from synthetic cannabis. So why are people turning to it despite its dangers?\nSimple. People typically choose synthetic cannabis over real cannabis for the following reasons:\n\nCannabis is illegal in their state\nSynthetic cannabinoids don’t turn up on a urine analysis\n\nUnfortunately, these short-sighted “advantages” aren’t worth the risk of death or serious side effects that can compromise your health. The success of these life-threatening products rides the wave of cannabis prohibition. It’s yet another reason to keep fighting the good fight for legalization.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/29195241/what-is-synthetic-marijuana-and-why-is-it-dangerous.jpg","urlslug":"/news/cannabis-101/what-is-synthetic-marijuana-and-why-is-it-dangerous"},{"id":"contentitems-3589","title":"Top 10 Strains to Combat Crohn’s Disease and Colitis","author":"Lisa Rough","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1417562220000)\/","text":"This week is Crohn’s Disease and Colitis Awareness week. For those of you that don’t know, Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are gastrointestinal disorders in a group of conditions known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\nCrohn’s Disease is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the rectum, although it may skip certain areas of the intestine, leaving some healthy, while other parts suffer. Ulcerative Colitis is a very similar disease in the IBD group of disorders, but it only affects the colon, affecting only the innermost lining of the colon. \nThe telltale symptoms of Crohn’s Disease:\n\nPersistent diarrhea\nRectal bleeding\nAbdominal pain and cramps\nConstipation\nUrgent need to move bowels\nSensation of incomplete evacuation or “rectal tenesmus” (Hey, you learned a new word!)\n\nOther signs that are associated with IBD:\n\nFever\nLoss of appetite\nWeight loss\nFatigue\nNight sweats\nLoss of menstrual cycle in women\n\nSounds terrible, doesn’t it? These are painful, life-altering disorders, which is why Crohn’s Disease and Colitis are specified as qualifying conditions for medical cannabis in nearly half of all medical marijuana states.\nThese symptoms can be controlled somewhat through diet, but often cannabis offers some of the best relief for the most severe symptoms – cramps, nausea, loss of appetite, etc.\nWithout further ado, in honor of Crohn’s Disease and Colitis Awareness Week, here are the top strains for your symptoms:\n 1. Jean Guy\nA fan favorite from our neighbors to the North (Canada, eh?), Jean Guy (pronounced “Jawn Gee”) is a sativa-dominant strain known for its high THC content and energizing effects. A great one to start your day cramp-free.\n 2. Hog\u0027s Breath\nHog’s Breath is a well-known indica with roots in the Kush landrace and is known for its potency against heavy pain and anxiety – a good strain to relax after a long work day.\n 3. Medicine Man\nMedicine Man lives up to its name by delivering potent pain relief with high levels of both THC and CBD. This medicinal strain is closely related to the master of the indica jungle – White Rhino.\n 4. Hash Plant\nHash Plant is known for an abundance of trichomes and a heavy body stone. This indica has a reputation for blissful euphoria, as well as easing pain and inflammation associated with Crohn’s and Colitis.\n 5. Willie Nelson\nWillie Nelson is named for the Red-Headed Stranger himself. This sativa offers a clear-headed, energetic high known to incite creativity, as well as a decent case of the munchies. \n 6. Chemo\nChemo is just as sedative as you might imagine – a heavy body high that’s perfect for chronic pain. Take note: the munchies are strong with this one. If you have stomach cramps or trouble eating, this strain will inspire your appetite.\n 7. Lemon Jack\nLemon Jack is born of the famed Jack Herer and Lemon Kush and offers strong psychoactive effects. Lemon Jack is a daytime strain as strong as a cup of coffee, but without the harsh stomach irritation. Recommended for users who suffer from fatigue.\n 8. Golden Pineapple\nGolden Pineapple is as delightful as it sounds. A hybrid cross that delivers uplifting, creative effects with a delicious fruity taste, it offers relief from stress and anxiety without causing fatigue.\n 9. Confidential Cheese\nConfidential Cheese is born of the legendary LA Confidential and Exodus Cheese. It offers powerful pain relief, as well as relief from insomnia. Great for winding down before bedtime, Confidential Cheese also subdues painful muscle spasms and cramps.\n 10. K2\nK2 is named for the world’s second highest mountain peak, which makes sense, as it comes from two of the greats – White Widow and Hindu Kush. K2 is known to increase appetite and calm nausea without any sedative sleepy effects, making it a great strain for both daytime and evening use.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002927/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis"}],"reviewCount":40,"flavors":[{"name":"Woody","score":112.40384615384616},{"name":"Earthy","score":22.884615384615383},{"name":"Sweet","score":11.442307692307692},{"name":"Citrus","score":11.442307692307692},{"name":"Flowery","score":10.961538461538462}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":138.17307692307693},{"name":"Happy","score":37.21153846153846},{"name":"Hungry","score":23.365384615384617},{"name":"Giggly","score":21.442307692307693},{"name":"Sleepy","score":11.923076923076923}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":104.80769230769231},{"name":"Pain","score":103.36538461538461},{"name":"Nausea","score":11.442307692307692},{"name":"Cramps","score":10.961538461538462},{"name":"Headaches","score":10}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":12.403846153846153},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":10.961538461538462},{"name":"Anxiety","score":1.9230769230769231},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.4423076923076923},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":0.96153846153846156}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":112.40384615384616},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":12.403846153846153},{"name":"Dizzy","score":10.961538461538462},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.4423076923076923},{"name":"Headache","score":0.48076923076923078}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_4143.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/627054/b/k2__primary_e5c6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_5d46.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/588410/b/k2__primary_157c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_2e7a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/509817/b/k2__primary_65c5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_4c4d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/442615/b/k2__primary_f4dd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_8486.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/426891/b/k2__primary_7401.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k2_100x100_acb7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/408748/b/k2__primary_1554.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":10,"popularCities":["Blanca, CO","Frisco, CO","Moffat, CO","Pueblo West, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/k2","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.025/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Hindu Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"hindu-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush","symbol":"Hk","applink":"leafly://strain/hindu-kush"},{"name":"White Widow","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-widow","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow","symbol":"Ww","applink":"leafly://strain/white-widow"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":"Hydro","floweringDays":56,"outdoorFinish":"End of September","height":"Short","averageYield":"Medium","environment":"Indoor","growNotes":"\n\tCompact plant that forms tight buds\n\tIdeal for\u0026nbsp;Sea of Green (SOG) method or when space is limited\n\tPromising yeilds\n\n"}}
