Less experienced people should beware not to over-indulge. It can induce mild panic/paranoia. The OG eventually takes over and just melts away any tension in your body. This is definitely in my top 3 favorite strains, along with Shiva Skunk and Blueberry Cheesecake. Do not pass this if you see it on a menu!!!!  ",
