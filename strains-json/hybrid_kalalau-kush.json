Then he had to evade helicopters, rangers, and rippers for months in the jungle to pull off the ultimate Hawaiian Kush strain named after her birth place in Kalalau Valley.\n\nKalalau Kush is the best kush you will ever taste! Like the clean pristine stream water of Kalalau, she taste of guavas and mangos with a hint of musky tropical spice.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"},{"id":1320474,"username":"emceevv","text":"nice","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":3,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Tropical","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Pineapple","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Mango","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Earthy","score":8.3333333333333321}],"effects":[{"name":"Tingly","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Uplifted","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Euphoric","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Happy","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Creative","score":25}],"symptoms":[],"conditions":[],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":25}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/kalalau-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
