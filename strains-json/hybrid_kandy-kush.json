In addition to a number of cow-themed strains such as Alpha Cow, Madcow, Purple Cow, and Afghan Cow, our comely cattle companions have also inspired an oft-used phrase used in many a Leafly review: “Holy cow!”\nIn honor of these dearly beloved domesticated ungulates, here are eight cannabis strains that inspired Leafly reviewers to exclaim “Holy cow” that I’ve helpfully paired with a corresponding gif.\n  Durban Poison\n“holy cow I’m flying. no such thing as stress or anxiety with this strain.” – chaosanon\n\n \n  Blockhead\n“I hit some of this from a bong along with some crazy dank lemon skunk and then vaped some of this blockhead (all with a friend) and holy cow i was flying high as a kite.” – chroniccannabisconsumsr\n\n \n  Kandy Kush\n“Holy cow was a privilege to try out this strain. […] Probably the smoothest that I have ever smoked. Was like a dream and to boot the exquisite candy floss flavour it brings is unbelievable!” – TheBigGreenGiant\n\n \n  Super Green Crack\n“Holy cow. […] Never felt more energetic in my life. Just felt like an energy to just get up and start doing shit. – hkim823\n\n \n  Sage N Sour\n“first commercially grow strain I’ve ever had, that being said HOLY COW! I ripped three huge hits from a bong and didn’t feel much yet so I killed the bowl, then it hit me …. I had to sit down for a sec and as the high progressed I got more and more energetic and super trippy I dont know how else to describe it but like being in. a 3D movie it was weird and then the world got flat and 2D like it was amazing then as I was coming down I felt like a super hero being ably to switch between reality,2D ,And more real than real 3D movie feeling” – COMetalHead\n\n \n  Lemon Haze\n“Holy COW. […] I got it last night, after I had already been smoking so I didn’t truly know its potential. I woke up this morning and loaded it up, about 2 hours before I had to go to work, with my last hit about 30 minutes before work. It is a GREAT get up and go, but be warned, you might [not] comprehend what you [are] getting up and going to.

Unlike almost any other coffeeshop, The Blue Bird extends complimentary samples of their competing strains from their own Volcano vaporizer during Cannabis Cup season—a luxury which Cup judges lack in United States. \nAt The Blue Bird, two vaporizer operators will greet you with a warm handshake and, while kindly preparing the Volcano for your use, entertain you with friendly banter about their memories of Boston, opinions on other coffeeshops, or whatever else may come up. They’ll give you SO-G Kush, a hybrid between LA Confidential and Kandy Kush grown by Soma Seeds. The word “clean” best describes their strain: smooth to taste and soothing to the soul. It engenders a nice, calm effect and a mild, tranquil sensation. \nConversely, Blue Bird’s other major competitor, their Afghan Water-Pressed ice hash, braces you with an invigorating and elating buzz (that is, if you can finagle the impressively gummy and malleable wad out of its baggie). While some familiar strains competed in the Amsterdam’s latest Cannabis Cup (Big Buddha Cheese from Prix D’Ami and AK-47 from Mellow Yellow, to cite two well-received examples), the novel strains ultimately walked away as the top winners. \nThe international marijuana industry, medicinal and otherwise, is rapidly growing as a more respectable, state-of-the-art one. In Amsterdam, coffeeshops constantly experiment as their industry begins to boom, and as the rest of the world takes its steps towards progressivism, the city likely serves as a model for the metropolis of the next generation. \n“During Prohibition,” explains Franco Loja, star of Strain Hunters, “Jack Daniels and Jim Beam were considered like we are today. But now, they’re Jack Daniels and Jim Beam.”\nFranco’s right. Evidence points towards a time in which coffeeshops will be no more taboo than bars, even in America, and Flowerbomb Kush no less prominent than Corona.\nBecause of the High Times Cannabis Cup, major growers and seed companies gain more interest and creativity in the field every year. They consistently introduce better and more effective strains to the world. From DNA Genetic’s Tangie to the ever so popular San Franciscan GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), cannabis is becoming a trade for connoisseurs. \nIn that sense, marijuana is no different than wine in the nuanced ways connoisseurs can appreciate its varieties. Slowly but surely, the stoner culture seems to be evolving into a more legitimate, respectable, and ordinary one. The seeds produced for the Amsterdam Cannabis Cup are becoming the buds of the future.\nWhat will you come up with, Los Angeles?\nPhoto credit: Stay Faded Photography via photopin cc","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/29200213/buds-of-the-future-an-americans-peek-into-amsterdams-coffeeshop-c-7e47.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/buds-of-the-future-an-americans-peek-into-amsterdams-coffeeshop-c-7e47"}],"reviewCount":452,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":43.58451536643026},{"name":"Earthy","score":33.112124282337049},{"name":"Flowery","score":21.700861195542043},{"name":"Lemon","score":21.035967578520765},{"name":"Citrus","score":17.662529550827422}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":58.045845997973657},{"name":"Happy","score":54.002448497129343},{"name":"Euphoric","score":53.582826747720361},{"name":"Uplifted","score":44.841269841269835},{"name":"Tingly","score":28.004896994258697}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":45.140999662276258},{"name":"Depression","score":33.576072272880779},{"name":"Insomnia","score":30.054035798716647},{"name":"Pain","score":24.780057413036136},{"name":"Nausea","score":10.988686254643701}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":44.5048125633232},{"name":"PTSD","score":22.548125633232011},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":19.5580040526849},{"name":"Arthritis","score":9.0725261735900027},{"name":"Anorexia","score":8.9446133063154338}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":29.837892603850047},{"name":"Dizzy","score":20.227963525835865},{"name":"Anxious","score":13.204576156703816},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":12.628757176629517},{"name":"Headache","score":8.4962850388382289}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/kandy-kush_100x100_33d7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/629784/b/kandy-kush__primary_3826.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/kandy-kush_100x100_81b0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/624171/b/kandy-kush__primary_22d1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/kandy-kush_100x100_431d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/616046/b/kandy-kush__primary_9356.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/kandy-kush_100x100_cd43.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/600923/b/kandy-kush__primary_b894.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/kandy-kush_100x100_2df8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/596594/b/kandy-kush__primary_0f9d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/kandy-kush_100x100_6c48.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/578296/b/kandy-kush__primary_a32d.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":149,"popularCities":["Denver, CO","Montréal, QC","Seattle, WA","Toronto, ON","Vancouver, BC","Calgary, AB","Colorado Springs, CO","Edmonton, AB","Everett, WA","Los Angeles, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/kandy-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.27433628318584/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"},{"name":"Trainwreck","subtitle":null,"slug":"trainwreck","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck","symbol":"Tw","applink":"leafly://strain/trainwreck"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":66,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tYields typically fall between\u0026nbsp;450-550g/m\u0026sup2;\n\n"}}
