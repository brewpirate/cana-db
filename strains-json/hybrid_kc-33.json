            "text": "I really like this strain. Smellwise it has an amazing smell. Very citrusy and a little bit of mint. It has decent crystals on it and orange hairs as well. The high it gave me was indeed very euphoric. It gave me alot of tingles and I can see this strain being very good for pain management. It gives you a kind of \"needles behind the eyes\" feeling/high, which sounds unpleasent but honestly, I don't mind it. The full on high kicks in after 40 from smoking it, and than it lasts for around 1 and half hour. Then you're left feeling very relaxed but still awake for maybe 2 hours max.",

            "text": "A relaxing high, but not \"couch lock\". Kills a lot of my joint/knee pain, allowing me to work all day. My fave aspect of this plant is it's ability to thrive in a cold environment. Even with the temps dropping below freezing, this strain showed no damage. Only after a week in temps as low as 20 every night did any \"freezer burn\" occur. And that was limited to only the water leaves. Great strain for PNW growers, especially those of us over 4500 Ft elevation.",
