Before we begin, may I ask that you please refrain from driving, operating heavy machinery, and calling your mother while under the influence of this strain. Seriously, it's got a powerful kick, and you'll forget why you called your mom. *COMMENCE INHALATION NOW* Alright, here we go ladies and gentleman. On our way up, you'll notice you're head get slightly lighter. Don't worry, this is just your body starting to settle into the change as we escalate. We are, now, starting to pick up speed. You should feel a slight tingle in your face, which will melt into the rest of your body shortly. And, we land land in 5..4..3..2..1. Congratulations, everyone. We have landed on Cloud 9. Please enjoy your stay at Imagination Land. Be sure to check out the Talkathon, Euphoric Paintings Exhibit, and Muscle Relaxation Spa. All are great treats, but I'm sure you'll have a blast. And remember to meet back here in a few hours. I'll have everyone's beds ready for them. Have a splendid time, everyone!",
