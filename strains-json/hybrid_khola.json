For the first 20 minutes after a fat joint you feel a big energetic buzz start to kick in, quite euphoric, and you really feel like you want to do something. At this moment you just feel reaal good. After the big head buzz - severe munchies followed by endless giggling. Had a great time after smoking this, just hanging out with friends eating, watching movies or just doing whatever you want. Overall its just the perfect smoke for a chilled out evening with a few mates. Fast, hard hitting effects, its just a shame that it didn't last very long.",
