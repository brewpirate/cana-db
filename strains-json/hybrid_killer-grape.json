Mt. Cook\n\nNamed after the highest peak in New Zealand, Mt. Cook by Kiwiseeds is a former Cannabis Cup champion.

Known to be powerful and sedative, this is a great strain to relax and catch some sleep with.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Island Maui Haze\n\nIsland Maui Haze is a 75/25 sativa-dominant strain with effects that can creep up on you. These dense, forest green buds may not initially attract you based on its strong, ammonia smell; however, this crystal-covered strain is praised for its uplifting, energetic effects that can relieve pain and other symptoms without bringing you down into a lazy state.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Island Maui Haze\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Leda Uno\n\nA Cannabis Cup finalist in the sativa category, Leda Uno will undoubtedly raise your spirits. The team at KC Brains took its KC 33 crossed with a Brazilian female landrace and crossed it once more with its KC 606 and Leda hybrid. The result is a smooth lemony hybrid with beautiful chunky, light green buds. Best when grown in soil, this plant can shoot to 10 feet outdoors and produces considerable yields.\n\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",
