By far the most powerful I have had so far yet since getting my MMJ card, I was having such an intense focus and head rush followed by extreme giggling and relaxation. This strain takes about 3 minutes to hit you like a train, and will drive you sky high all while making your head feel like a bowling ball. I recommend this strain to anybody that\u0027s overly confident in their tolerance- or anybody with a high tolerance that is looking for pain relief. \nAlso S/O to Dabz AZ 24/7 delivery as well for giving me this strain, they were the only place that had it and they not only delivered at an insanely fast time period but the quality was just magnificent.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"},{"id":1634444,"username":"WhoIsTheJMan","text":"Named after the one and only Kimbo Slice, this strain will kick your ass in the best way possible.

The celebration was sponsored by Leafly and showcased some of the region’s best cannabis flower, concentrates, edibles, topicals, glass artists, and accessories. Even a last-minute venue change couldn’t stop the stream of cannabis lovers from overflowing the state fair-themed event that came complete with infused cotton candy, a mechanical joint to ride, magicians, performers, artists, and more. Honestly, the only thing missing was a medicated corn dog to combat my munchies.\nAs expected, the dab bar was the hive that everyone was buzzing around, with a variety of solvent and solventless concentrates to sample from some of the best extract artists in the area. The highlight had to be local artist Scott Deppe’s crystal skull piece that sat at the X-Tracted bar and captured every passer-by with its intricate design and whopping 6-figure price tag. Those who weren’t concentrated around the dab rigs were busy sampling edibles, entering raffles, and relaxing with a massage at one the topical company booths.\n\nA judge’s pass to the event allowed visitors to join the action by sampling each of the strains entered into the People\u0027s Choice category of the Cup. For $99, the judge’s pass gave ticket-holders a half gram sample of all 10 anonymous strains and the opportunity to vote for their favorite. The mystery strains all had amazing flavors, ranging from sweet and tropical to earthy and piney, which made it all the more difficult to choose a favorite.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the
