No, really. This strain feels easy on the lungs and the high is instant. A relaxing body high and all-around happiness will hit you within seconds of your first puff. \nYou can keep smoking this and not really reach that \"uncomfortable zone\" many of us are familiar with, and is fairly priced for the product it is. You could drop more money on a strain like GSC and maybe get a more aggressive high, or you could save and get this phenomenal strain. I sincerely would reach for this on the counter sooner than I would some of the more well-known strains.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"},{"id":1637692,"username":"Caminoman","text":"My favorite.
