I feel awesome. One good hit was all I needed. Damn, talk about priveleged. I am so lucky right now. I can't wait to read this when I'm sober. And show my boyfriend when he comes home \ud83d\ude01\n\nSo this weed tho. I feel mellow, chill, good vibes. Creative like I haven't been for a long time. Even just writing this review feels good because I'm doing something creative that is my own.\n\nGot distracted again. I have severe depression, anxiety, ADD, PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), IBS, chronic migraines. Needless to say I qualified for medical marijuana card. This is one of those times I actually feel normal, do you know how grateful I am for that? With as many problems as I have, just being okay is sometimes a miracle. Kosher Tangie, thank you. I can't thank you enough.",

            "text": "Kosher Tangie is a fantastic daytime strain with soaring highs and a constant energy. I recently purchased the live resin vape cartridge by Cresco Labs in PA and was impressed with the clean and smooth hit. To say that this vape was delicious is not doing it justice. It's tart and sweet like a glass of fresh squeezed juice. My only complaint with vapes in general is the effects are not long lasting enough for someone with high tolerance. I don't know why this is. A little bit of flower goes a long way - vapes seem made to be run through quickly IMHO.",
