Wow why doesn\u0027t this auto capitalize? Anyways, I\u0027m high on this right now with my twinkling string lights on in my cozy little cottage/cabin home. I feel awesome. One good hit was all I needed. Damn, talk about priveleged. I am so lucky right now. I can\u0027t wait to read this when I\u0027m sober. And show my boyfriend when he comes home 😁\n\nSo this weed tho. I feel mellow, chill, good vibes. Creative like I haven\u0027t been for a long time. Even just writing this review feels good because I\u0027m doing something creative that is my own.\n\nGot distracted again. I have severe depression, anxiety, ADD, PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), IBS, chronic migraines. Needless to say I qualified for medical marijuana card. This is one of those times I actually feel normal, do you know how grateful I am for that? With as many problems as I have, just being okay is sometimes a miracle. Kosher Tangie, thank you.
