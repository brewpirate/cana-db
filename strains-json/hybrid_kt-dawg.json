This hybrid blends anti-inflammatory pain relief and pleasurable physical effects with a focused, cerebral buzz. KT Dawg\u0026rsquo;s aroma is pungent, reeking of skunk and forest floor. The earthy terpenes mellow on the palate while stimulating appetite and creativity. KT Dawg is a cross of Kunduz, \u0026nbsp;Tang Tang, and Stardawg. \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\n","aka":null,"rating":4.83,"highlightedReviews":[{"id":1387238,"username":"DrewJudah","text":"Simply amazing.

High percentage, bulk popcorn flower.  I have become a fan of Cresco as of late.  They always throw a Boveda 58 in their bulk flower!  Definite perk!  When I opened this up it looked like a dead octopus still trying to camouflage itself.  Very dark initially, little red/orange hairs everywhere like feelers, and pungent.  Almost looked like a rats nest.  Lightened up as it got a little bit of air it seemed.  Very dark once ground!  It didn\u0027t look good really, but it is.  I just did back-to-back, one-hit rips out of my C2 Bell Base and i\u0027m higher than Charlie Sheen!  The tingly, energetic, feel good experience.  Pain relief, heavy eyes (RED), and relaxed.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":6,"flavors":[{"name":"Flowery","score":44.444444444444443},{"name":"Earthy","score":44.444444444444443},{"name":"Skunk","score":38.888888888888886},{"name":"Pungent","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Sweet","score":10.555555555555555}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":136.66666666666666},{"name":"Uplifted","score":98.888888888888886},{"name":"Happy","score":71.111111111111114},{"name":"Euphoric","score":54.999999999999993},{"name":"Creative","score":48.888888888888886}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":71.666666666666657},{"name":"Depression","score":66.666666666666657},{"name":"Stress","score":38.333333333333329},{"name":"Fatigue","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":33.333333333333329}],"conditions":[{"name":"PTSD","score":38.888888888888886},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":38.888888888888886},{"name":"Epilepsy","score":5.5555555555555554},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":5.5555555555555554},{"name":"Arthritis","score":5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":21.666666666666664},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":5.5555555555555554}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/kt-dawg_100x100_5b2c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/654796/b/kt-dawg__primary_744b.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Chicago, IL","Portland, OR","Addison, IL","Collinsville, IL","Fulton, IL","Highland Park, IL","Justice, IL","Mundelein, IL","Oak Park, IL","Quincy, IL"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/kt-dawg","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.83333333333333/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Stardawg","subtitle":null,"slug":"stardawg","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/stardawg","symbol":"Sta","applink":"leafly://strain/stardawg"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
