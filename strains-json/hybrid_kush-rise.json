The batch I picked up recently was at 23.02% THC with nugs looking so robust n' frosty white that I almost felt bad grinding them. \n\nI find it good for any time of the day when I just need to slow down a bit without totally compromising my thought process. A little bit goes a long way though, you can get messed up on this. \n\nKush Rise also eases and stops my mind from thinking about pain. And man it melts stress and promotes relaxation! Relaxed but not sleepy or couch locking. Highly recommend!",
