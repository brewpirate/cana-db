    "description": "<p>LA Kookies is Los Angeles Kush&rsquo;s version of the legendary California native, <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/girl-scout-cookie\">Girl Scout Cookies</a>. This strain takes a potent GSC <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/cannabis-genotypes-and-phenotypes-what-makes-a-strain-unique\">phenotype</a> and crosses it with OG Kush Breath, a genetic relative of GSC. This tertiary backcross enriches the strain&rsquo;s Cookie attributes while enhancing its savory terpene profile. The aroma is pungent and doughy with touches of pine, while the flavor is sweet with candied cherries, butter cookies, and earth. This perfect middle-of-the-road hybrid relaxes the body while enhancing mood, making it a natural complement for consumers suffering from chronic pain.&nbsp;</p>\n",

            "text": "this is one of my favorite strains of all time because in my opinion, any cookie strain is great, from blue cookies to platinum cookies & so on, but this cookie strain goes above and beyond ! In both looks and taste. The texture is amazing, it's very sticky and dense and has the great \"cookie\" smell & look to it. Not to mention the fact that it had over 32% thc ! If you can, try this strain right when CHR gets a fresh batch , you won't regret it . #iLOVElosangeleskush \ud83d\udc9a",
