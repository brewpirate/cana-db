It  also doesn't make me anxious either, it's perfect. \n\nI've been able to clean, get work done etc. after smoking this, but have also been able to just sit and relax. I wish I would have gotten more. Definitely one of my all time favorites.",

The bud had two different shades, medium to darker green that looked much lighter because of all the fine clear trichomes & burnt orange pistils everywhere. Buds super dense. The taste & smell i got was that of pine. The effects made me VERY happy and then VERY relaxed. An uplifted body high. What you expect from a top shelf product. PEACE & LOVE",
