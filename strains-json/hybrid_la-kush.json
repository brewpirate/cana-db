Even though it\u0027s like 85% indica, it doesn\u0027t make me tired at all, just relaxed and happy. It  also doesn\u0027t make me anxious either, it\u0027s perfect. \n\nI\u0027ve been able to clean, get work done etc. after smoking this, but have also been able to just sit and relax. I wish I would have gotten more. Definitely one of my all time favorites.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"},{"id":1608945,"username":"1kushking","text":"Los Angeles Kush did well again with LA Kush. My eighth was beautiful to look at. One bud alone weighed 2.5 grams! The bud had two different shades, medium to darker green that looked much lighter because of all the fine clear trichomes \u0026 burnt orange pistils everywhere. Buds super dense. The taste \u0026 smell i got was that of pine. The effects made me VERY happy and then VERY relaxed. An uplifted body high. What you expect from a top shelf product.
