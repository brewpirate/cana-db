Not the most potent of strains so you can casually enjoy this one a little more without getting too stoned. It did help me with lack of appetite and nausea the other day, and just like most strains after the mouth watering initial enjoyment it will eventually give you cottonmouth; nothing like a ice cold water with a fresh tasting tree.",
