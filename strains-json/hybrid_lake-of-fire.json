            "text": "The Leafly Strain Explorer is growing thanks to the mix of indicas and hybrids added this week. Many of the new strains we add each week are suggested by the Leafly faithful like you, so thank you for all of your useful suggestions!\nEach entry has been added to the database and is ready for your review, so pick them up if they're available in your area and give them a try. You can also check out all the other newly added strains in our Explorer and leave a review for any that you enjoy.\n\u00a0\n 1. Kobain Kush\n\nKobain Kush is an indica-dominant hybrid that crosses Pre-98 Bubba Kush with White Lotus. The goal of this breeding project, by Red Eyed Genetics, was to increase the yield, stretch, and overall vigor of the early Bubba Kush cutting to achieve shorter vegetative cycles and enhance the overall potency and bag appeal. Subtle hints of purple begin to show late in the flowering period, with Kobain Kush buds that emit a mixture of sweet coffee and earthy pine that is highlighted with diesel undertones. The relaxing kick of indica effects will help calm stress and relax the body from head to toe.\n\n\u00a0\n 2. Snow Diesel\n\nSnow Diesel, bred by House of Funk Genetics, is a hybrid that was developed by crossing an East Coast Sour Diesel clone with a Snow Lotus male. Known for its extreme yields even under the constraints of indoor cultivation, Snow Diesel produces a range of diesel aromas that shift from sweet candied flavors to a dank musky funk. This balanced hybrid conjures a full range of effects that lift your mood, spark happiness, and incite creativity. While it prefers an organic soil mix, the Snow Diesel genetics are stable enough to thrive under any growing conditions.\n\n\u00a0\n 3. Lodi Dodi\n\nLodi Dodi is a sativa-dominant hybrid popular in Washington State. Exclusively bred by The Clone Zone, the genetic heritage of Lodi Dodi is undefined and closely guarded. Lodi Dodi carries a sweet, unique flavor of tropical fruit and fresh wildflowers. The pungent aroma leads the way towards a cerebral buzz, known to spark creativity and a boost of energy that will turn any task into a more enjoyable adventure.\n\n\u00a0\n 4. Black Bubba\n\nBlack Bubba is an indica-dominant cross of Bubba Kush and Black Russian. The resulting buds carry a sweet aroma with subtle fruit notes that produce earthy flavors of hash and pine. The relaxing indica effects calm body pains, stimulate the appetite, and are known to sedate the body into a state of couchlock.\n\n\u00a0\n 5. Lake of Fire\n\nLake of Fire is a hybrid of GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4) and Kobain Kush bred by Red Eyed Genetics. The result is a heavily frosted, chocolate, and pine flavored mixture of diesel fumes that produce balanced effects that stimulate the mind while relaxing the body. The influence of Kobain Kush genetics adds vigor and minimizes difficulty in cultivating a spinoff of the award-winning GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4).\n\n\u00a0\n 6. Loud Scout\n\nLoud Scout is an award-winning hybrid from Loud Seeds. By crossing GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) with Platinum OG Kush, Loud Seeds created a potent and complex mix of sweet, floral flavors that took 1st place for Hybrids at the 2012 Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam. The unique flavor profile of Loud Scout ushers in a heady mix of cerebral energy with a calm, relaxed body that is great for unwinding.\n\n\u00a0\n 7. ChemWreck\n\nChemWreck is a sativa-dominant hybrid bred by Lionhart. The combination of Chemdawg and Trainwreck genetics gives way to a pungent aroma of diesel fumes that produces flavors of lemon, citrus, and pine. The potent effects of ChemWreck are uplifting and energetic, providing creative stimulation and deep relaxation without putting you to sleep.",

            "text": "This is definitely a child of \"Gorilla Glue #4.\"  Very strong medicine, but different from GG.  Does not take a lot to get the job done.  Taste is piney/diesellie, and pretty smooth both in and out.  Effects hit me behind the eyes and then down the whole body relieving pain, stress, and calms everything down enough so it can be dealt with.  Too much, and you will be tied to the couch and asleep.  Duration is a couple hours 2-3, and the come-down is not a crash like many heavy hitters.  Overall, this is a fantastic medication and gets 5 stars.",
