            "text": "If you don\u2019t get high before attending a sporting event, then you\u2019re doing it all wrong. I mean, sure, you can have a good time while being sober, but you can have a great time while being lifted.\nSo with that said, I curated a list of suggested strains for you to indulge in, depending on which sport you\u2019re going to see. Peep the list, use Leafly\u2019s Finder to locate the dispensaries stocking these strains, purchase, and enjoy some good ol\u2019 sportsball.\nStrains to Pair With Exciting Sports (Basketball, Football, Soccer, Hockey)\nSports that fall under this category are the types of sports that include constant back and forth action, which keeps you engaged from start to finish. A big play is always looming, so you\u2019re stuck to the edge of your seat because you don\u2019t want to miss that big dunk or the chance to yell \u201cGOOOOAAALLLLL\u201d in the face of whoever\u2019s sitting next to you. For that reason, you should indulge in strains that\u2019ll have you uplifted and energetic, feeling hyped and ready for that big moment.\n\u00a0 Candyland\nCandyland\u2019s a high-THC, sativa-dominant hybrid that\u2019ll have you super smacked without the paranoia. As a mix of Grandaddy Purple and Platinum GSC, it\u2019s got an earthy type of scent and a sweet flavor, with effects that will have you uplifted, engaged, and in a whole entire world of euphoria. Smoke these before an exciting sport and those big plays will feel that much bigger.\nFind Candyland Nearby\n\u00a0 Green Crack\nEveryone knows how good, energized, and focused Green Crack can make you feel. It\u2019s one of those strains that you can smoke and power through the day like you drank 84 cold brews, so it\u2019s perfect to smoke before a sporting event that you want to be locked into.\nFind Green Crack Nearby\n\u00a0 Cotton Candy Kush\nCotton Candy Kush is another high-THC strain that leaves you feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good, like Outkast on \u201cGhettoMusick.\u201d As a mix of Power Plant and Lavender, its powerful effects are relaxing yet still energetic while inducing happiness, freedom, and overall euphoria, so you\u2019ll be that much more excited when you see that Ronaldo bicycle kick for the game-winning goal live and in person.\nFind Cotton Candy Kush Nearby\n\u00a0 Stardawg\nStardawg is one of the best smelling, best tasting, most euphoric, most energetic, most everything strains I\u2019ve ever come across. Gifted to me by LTRMN in Portland, I smoked this and walked around the city for hours, falling in love with everything and everybody. It\u2019s definitely a strain I\u2019d recommend smoking before a sporting event, because every single dunk, touchdown, and goal will likely feel like the greatest moment in sports history for you.\nFind Stardawg Nearby\nStrains to Pair With Chill Sports (Baseball, Golf, Tennis)\nSports that fall under this category tend to be a lot more laid-back and reserved. Baseball games can be long and boring, and golf and tennis matches require damn near complete silence, with light clapping being the most excited you can get, so if you\u2019re overly hyped at any of them, you may feel a bit uncomfortable or out-of-place. These strains will help you lean a little more towards the indica side of things.\n\u00a0 Obama Kush\nObama Kush is a great indica with a relatively mild THC percentage that\u2019ll chill you out without knocking you out. I smoked a gram joint of Obama Kush a few weeks ago and knocked out the entire first season of Girls Incarcerated\u00a0on Netflix, which is still shorter than one full-length baseball game.\nFind Obama Kush Nearby\n\u00a0 Larry OG\nLarry OG is a hybrid of OG Kush and SFV OG, whose indica effects will overtake your body and have you with your feet in the air like your Cares-to-Give Meter is at zero. Smoke a little of this and you\u2019ll have no problem sitting through an entire round of golf, where the most exciting thing possible is a fox running across the course.\nFind Larry OG Nearby\n\u00a0 Cheese\nCheese is an indica-dominant hybrid that:\n\nactually smells like Cheese, which is wild; and\nwill have you feeling relaxed while avoiding the sleepy sleepy nap nap state of mind.\n\nYou can smoke some Cheese and kick back in comfort for hours, so if you\u2019re going to see one of the chill sports where everything\u2019s deathly silent and calm, Cheese is a good strain to indulge in beforehand.\nFind Cheese Nearby",

Makes you cough, just a bit.\r\n\r\nComes on really slow from the base of your neck around the spine to fill up the brain with goose down. Creeps in with a constant low/heavy flow, like a steady rise of ocean tide in an estuary. Then it settles into your upper body. Head becomes heavy, leaning to one side. Eyes and mouth tingle. Lungs feel a bit heavy. Definitely good pain meds. Not too giggly, and seemingly really focused. Was able to do some PHP coding and set up a new website without too many distractions - even though my body feels stupid.\r\n\r\nCurrently deep into my first hour and a half.

In a glass bowl the smoke makes the fore-mentioned more favorable.\n\nI suffer from chronic pain and this worked very well. i didn't have to take my regular pain medicine. I felt relaxed, yet very creative. I am a coder and video editor - it got me back to being more attentive to  my crafts and hobbies. The buzz creeps up on you and stays for a good while - making you feel warm and cozy.\n\nMy eyes got a little dry, but reading sure didn't help the situation either. Yes, I got the munchies, but it wasn't like I was ravenous , just wanted something light and not to messy.\n\nOverall it is a very good strain. I recommend it for those suffering with pain and muscle spasms. Pain medicine has a way of upsetting your stomach after a prolonged period of use. Larry OG will put a break in that cycle.",
