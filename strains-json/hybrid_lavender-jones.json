Tread with ease. Read on (newcomers: see note about paranoia)\n\nI bought this at the advice of my budtender at Altitude Littleton. I requested something that\u0027s good for stimulating the creative juices, and he suggested this. Buds are fuzzy and dense with a nice purple hue to them. Pleasant scent of lavender, pine, with a hint of oak. It does not have a skunky or kushy smell to it, and the scent profile seems sativa influenced.\n\nWhen smoked, the flavor is quite pleasant and this smokes easily. I rarely cough with this strain, even with a super tiny pipe. It hits hard and fast in the head first, but the body effects subtly grow to be very potent.  This can make this strain a bit too potent for some people as they will smoke more than they can handle.\n\nThe head effects typically lead me to constantly smile. I feel at ease, socialable. When smoked at high doses, it can be disorienting and almost feel hallucinogenic. Paranoia is a big deal with this strain - likely the worst in that category I\u0027ve ever experienced among strains - new users, take note before you try this! \n\nThe body effects creep up on you, starting with a subtle couchlock amplifying to waves of sensation flowing through you. It can be overwhelming, even for an experienced user (I consider myself to be a significant smoker and this blew me away), so be careful, dont even think about driving, and see if you can last through a horror movie without screaming out loud while high on this.\n\nYou won\u0027t be able to. \n\nOn a serious note, this is a great strain, but it\u0027s not an appropriate strain for a patient with severe anxiety.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1631955,"username":"JCDUBYA21","text":"This bud is amazing!
