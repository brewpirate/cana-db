The nugget are relatively compact and are covered in Trichromes. They are a very light muted green with almost light pink hairs. The manicure job, as with anything from L\u0027Eagle Services, is very much on point. \n\nTaste Rating: 5.00 \nTaste Description: The flavor on this strain is incredible. You get sweet lemon and citrus along with a hint of pungent pine, spice, and earth in there. Call me crazy, but I swear I got a mild tone of banana on the exhale. It is not only delicious, but definitely unique. \n\nEffects Rating: 5.00 \nEffects Description: This sativa dominant hybrid has amazing effects. It is exceptionally uplifting mentally and physically. There is some mild body relaxation and intense euphoria. I could see a strong sativa like this making some anxious, but I had none of that at all. Nothing but positive, happiness, and smiles. \n\nOverall Rating: 5.00\nOverall Summary: HUGE kudos to L\u0027Eagle services for creating this strain. I am so impressed; it is definitely a new favorite. L\u0027Eagle Eagle is incredible in every way. This is a must try whether you\u0027re just visiting or live locally; either way it\u0027s worth it!
