I’ve tried this strain 3 different times and each time I’ve had the same experience, a nice light high that makes me feel calm, relaxed, and focused. The problem is that when the high goes away, it happens suddenly like it’s sucked out of me and it’s very noticeable. Also the high has only lasted about 1hr or so which was also pretty disappointing as well. \nAgain I personally feel that my negative experiences were more due to how the strain was cultivated. I would love to try it again.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3255","title":"New Strains Alert: Citrix, CannaSutra, Gelato, Lemon Alien Dawg, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1438963200000)\/","text":"New strains have just been added to the Leafly strain database, and if you\u0027re the type of person who appreciates flavor, we suggest you bee line it to one of the dispensaries/shops listed below. Lemon Marmalade, Lemon Alien Dawg, Citrix, Gelato…we\u0027ve got your fruity fix covered. Now go forth and leave some strain reviews for all the ones you\u0027ve already experienced!\n \n 1. Citrix\n\nCitrix is a hybrid cannabis strain that draws its genetics from a flavorful Grapefruit mother and a resinous LA Confidential male. Named for its intense orange aroma, Citrix entices the senses before drawing you into its active, clear-headed euphoria. If Citrix makes it into your garden, the telltale signs of a good phenotype include a pungent aroma, disease resistance, heavy yields, rapid vegetative growth, and a dense bud structure.\n\nClick here for a full list of dispensaries and recreational shops carrying Citrix\n \n 2. DelaHaze\n\nDelaHaze by Paradise Seeds is a 70% sativa strain bred from Mango Haze and California Lemon Skunk genetics. To the delight of commercial growers, DelaHaze has the energetic effect profile of a Haze sativa while still offering sizeable yields and a moderate flowering time. Mango and citrus notes express themselves loudly and bring a sweet overtone to the strain\u0027s earthy, spicy aroma. Staying true to its Haze genetics, this sativa delivers uplifting cerebral energy that fuels creativity, focus, and happiness, and then tapers into calm relaxation in time.\n\nDelaHaze is currently available at Seattle Cannabis Co. (Recreational — Seattle, WA) and Local Roots Marijuana (Recreational — Bothell, WA)\n \n 3. CannaSutra\n\nCannaSutra by Delta 9 Labs is a 70/30 indica-dominant cannabis strain parented by Reclining Buddha and Sensi Star. Appropriately derived from the Sanskrit love guide Kama Sutra, this strain is said to sharpen the senses for enhanced romantic encounters. Mellow and functional enough to leave mental acuity intact, CannaSutra is an excellent indica for daytime indulgence. Its flavor is comparable to that of incense, with sweet hashy accents that leave you feeling relaxed and peaceful as you exhale.\n\nCannaSutra is currently available at Natural Green Medicine (Medical — Seattle, WA)\n \n 4. Gelato\n\nGelato is another tantalizing hybrid cannabis strain from Cookie Fam Genetics, following in the footsteps of its parents Sunset Sherbet and Thin Mint GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies). This Bay Area, California native gets its name from the fruity, dessert-like aroma, a common genetic thread among the Cookie family. Her buds tend to bloom in dark purple hues illuminated by fiery orange hairs and a shining white coat of crystal resin. Novice consumers may want to approach this THC powerhouse with caution, but those armed with a high tolerance will delight in Gelato’s heavy-handed euphoria. Physical relaxation comes on strong, but many find themselves still mentally agile enough to stay productive and creative when enjoying Gelato during the day.\n\nClick here for a full list of dispensaries and recreational shops carrying Gelato\n \n 5. White Buffalo\n\nWhite Buffalo is an 80/20 sativa-dominant cannabis strain that descends from a Romulan and a Blackberry Kush/Bay 11 hybrid. Like the sacred animal of Native American tradition, this White Buffalo is a cherished rarity that may only seldom migrate to your stash jar. Sweetly sour in flavor and covered in a snowy coat of crystal trichomes, White Buffalo provides a powerful blast of euphoria that may surprise any consumer expecting an active and uplifting sativa experience.\n\nClick here for a full list of dispensaries and recreational shops carrying White Buffalo\n \n 6. Lemon Alien Dawg\n\nLemon Alien Dawg comes from Alien Genetics, who crossbred an Alien Dawg female with Lemon Kush to create this pungent hybrid cannabis strain. Large chunky buds radiate with sweet and sour fruity notes dominated by the zesty scent of lemon. Leaning slightly to the indica side of the genetic spectrum, Lemon Alien Dawg lets your body sink into deep relaxation while the mind floats away to happy escapes.\n\nClick here for a full list of dispensaries and recreational shops carrying Lemon Alien Dawg\n \n 7. Lemon Marmalade\n\nLemon Marmalade is potent hybrid from Washington State, bred by Platinum Extracts. The strain was developed by crossing Deadhead OG with Cookie Dough, a select phenotype of GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies). Caked with trichomes and radiating citrus and diesel fumes, Lemon Marmalade creates a complex flavor mix of lemon and piney Kush with subtle fruit undertones. Lemon Marmalade took home the prize for Best BHO – THC at the 2015 DOPE Cup in Seattle and rumor has it the flower has tested upwards of 30% THC. The effects from Lemon Marmalade come on quick with a euphoric burst of heady energy that quickly levels off into a more relaxing full-bodied experience.\n\n ","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12002031/new-strains-alert-citrix-cannasutra-gelato-lemon-alien-dawg-and-m.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-citrix-cannasutra-gelato-lemon-alien-dawg-and-m"}],"reviewCount":62,"flavors":[{"name":"Lemon","score":75.351288056206073},{"name":"Earthy","score":59.192037470725992},{"name":"Pungent","score":58.372365339578451},{"name":"Skunk","score":58.372365339578451},{"name":"Citrus","score":14.519906323185012}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":135.65573770491804},{"name":"Happy","score":73.711943793911},{"name":"Euphoric","score":73.302107728337234},{"name":"Creative","score":62.880562060889929},{"name":"Focused","score":58.079625292740047}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":74.004683840749422},{"name":"Stress","score":67.27166276346604},{"name":"Nausea","score":64.402810304449645},{"name":"Pain","score":57.259953161592506},{"name":"Cramps","score":51.639344262295083}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":66.4519906323185},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":57.96252927400468},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":14.402810304449648},{"name":"Arthritis","score":12.763466042154565},{"name":"PTSD","score":6.8501170960187352}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":112.47072599531616},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":57.96252927400468},{"name":"Headache","score":50.409836065573771},{"name":"Dizzy","score":3.9812646370023419},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.4098360655737705}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-alien-dawg_100x100_1771.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/564048/b/lemon-alien-dawg__primary_75fd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-alien-dawg_100x100_2108.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/551355/b/lemon-alien-dawg__primary_3a54.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-alien-dawg_100x100_b399.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/501877/b/lemon-alien-dawg__primary_c229.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-alien-dawg_100x100_e51a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/398058/b/lemon-alien-dawg__primary_750e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-alien-dawg_100x100_300c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/383833/b/lemon-alien-dawg__primary_7a54.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-alien-dawg_100x100_f561.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/369802/b/lemon-alien-dawg__primary_3d35.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":6,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Spokane, WA","Lynnwood, WA","Mount Vernon, WA","Mountlake Terrace, WA","Spokane Valley, WA","Airway Heights, WA","Bremerton, WA","Cle Elum, WA","Eugene, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.48387096774194/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Alien Dawg","subtitle":null,"slug":"alien-dawg","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/alien-dawg","symbol":"Adg","applink":"leafly://strain/alien-dawg"},{"name":"Lemon Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"lemon-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-kush","symbol":"Lk","applink":"leafly://strain/lemon-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
