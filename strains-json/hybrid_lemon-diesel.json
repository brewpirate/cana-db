            "text": "This is a journal entry for 'Lemon Sour Diesel\" couldn't find it on here and this is the closest pretty much. Wow. My new favourite strain by a long shot. Absolutely unbelievable euphoria, immediately feel brilliant and comfortable with the atmosphere and everyone around you. Couldn't push harder enough for sufferers of anxiety and depression to smoke this, just turns everything into a joke. Great intensity and felt the high coming on heavily after 4 tokes. The lemon scent is just as intense as the high, used my grinder to grind up a g or so and it was as if there was a slice of lemon in there. When smoking though, the lemon flavour isn't so potent as it is overcome by a musky, oily taste, but is a great tasting smoke. Only drawback is the severe dry mouth and very slight paranoia between novice smokers as my friend showed after 3 or so joints but the high is so worth every white drop of spit, 10/10 want everyone to try this for an enjoyable, giggly, euphoric high.",

            "text": "i tried this strain yesterday and it was my first time smoking weed in 2 years when i only started trying it to begin with.\n \nThe bud had a very pungent lemon and diesel smell but when i smoked it from a bong the experience was so much different from what i tried previously and not long after i got so high that my eyes went bright red and felt very heavy.\n\nI enjoyed it but i smoked (0.2g - 0.3g) for my first time in a homemade bong and it was really relaxing and the effects were so strong on me that i began to see tracers and mild visual effects so i would suggest that anyone trying this for the first time should only start with a modest amount unless you are comfortable with the effects since i found it to be really harsh on the throat but there is no doubt that this is a high quality strain and for the most-part it was an enjoyable high but it was a lot to handle for a near first time experience.",
