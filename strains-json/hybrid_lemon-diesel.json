When smoking though, the lemon flavour isn\u0027t so potent as it is overcome by a musky, oily taste, but is a great tasting smoke. Only drawback is the severe dry mouth and very slight paranoia between novice smokers as my friend showed after 3 or so joints but the high is so worth every white drop of spit, 10/10 want everyone to try this for an enjoyable, giggly, euphoric high.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sPaGuIbcIjKwcF8O7kQXXoAFJ6s=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fkfmswExdS0yqeEmdLkUQ_nerd-green.png"},{"id":1628955,"username":"ZombieOG_","text":"i tried this strain yesterday and it was my first time smoking weed in 2 years when i only started trying it to begin with.\n \nThe bud had a very pungent lemon and diesel smell but when i smoked it from a bong the experience was so much different from what i tried previously and not long after i got so high that my eyes went bright red and felt very heavy.\n\nI enjoyed it but i smoked (0.2g - 0.3g) for my first time in a homemade bong and it was really relaxing and the effects were so strong on me that i began to see tracers and mild visual effects so i would suggest that anyone trying this for the first time should only start with a modest amount unless you are comfortable with the effects since i found it to be really harsh on the throat but there is no doubt that this is a high quality strain and for the most-part it was an enjoyable high but it was a lot to handle for a near first time experience.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":464,"flavors":[{"name":"Lemon","score":52.5686037126715},{"name":"Diesel","score":31.031476997578693},{"name":"Citrus","score":21.846246973365616},{"name":"Earthy","score":10.753026634382566},{"name":"Flowery","score":8.1485068603712669}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":100.4229217110573},{"name":"Euphoric","score":91.734866828087178},{"name":"Uplifted","score":88.517352703793378},{"name":"Relaxed","score":66.187651331719124},{"name":"Creative","score":61.24414850686037}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":30.50322841000807},{"name":"Stress","score":24.928167877320419},{"name":"Fatigue","score":14.140032284100082},{"name":"Insomnia","score":11.843422114608556},{"name":"Pain","score":9.1892655367231644}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":27.42413236481033},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":22.573849878934624},{"name":"PTSD","score":13.916868442292172},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":9.2699757869249382},{"name":"Anorexia","score":8.8999192897497981}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":51.3498789346247},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":20.257465698143665},{"name":"Dizzy","score":17.969330104923326},{"name":"Anxious","score":3.30225988700565},{"name":"Paranoid","score":3.0169491525423728}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/lemon-diesel/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/lemon-diesel/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-diesel_100x100_8f61.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/673611/b/lemon-diesel__primary_a100.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-diesel_100x100_93fb.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/653136/b/lemon-diesel__primary_bd2d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-diesel_100x100_f998.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/625835/b/lemon-diesel__primary_aa11.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-diesel_100x100_5c6f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/611787/b/lemon-diesel__primary_295b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-diesel_100x100_c331.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/610128/b/lemon-diesel__primary_36c4.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-diesel_100x100_c735.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/559409/b/lemon-diesel__primary_2723.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":142,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Denver, CO","Eugene, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Bend, OR","Montréal, QC","Phoenix, AZ","Toronto, ON","Calgary, AB","Edmonton, AB"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-diesel","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.19827586206897/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"California Sour","subtitle":null,"slug":"california-sour","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/california-sour","symbol":"Cas","applink":"leafly://strain/california-sour"},{"name":"Lost Coast OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"lost-coast-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/lost-coast-og","symbol":"Lco","applink":"leafly://strain/lost-coast-og"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":67,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
