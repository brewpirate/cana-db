            "text": "Dating back to the 18th century, bluegrass sits at the intersection of traditional Scottish, Irish, and English folk music. Settlers brought their ballads, dance music, and fiddles to the Appalachian Mountains in North America, where their individual melodies mixed together to create an uplifting sound that has been passed down from musician to musician for generations.\n\nBluegrass may be a cousin to folk, traditional, and Americana music, but at its heart it exists as one of the most distinct and noteworthy individual genres of our time. It is music that weaves stories and moves the soul\u2014it\u2019s a rich and colorful genre that can excite and invigorate the senses, especially with a little cannabis nearby.\nBelow, explore five bluegrass bands with your favorite pre-roll\u00a0in hand\u2014preferably on a rocking chair, soaking in the soulful tunes.\nLaws of Gravity by The Infamous Stringdusters\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Tangilope\nThe Infamous Stringdusters\u2019 latest album, Laws of Gravity, wastes no time as it bursts into life with their first track, \u201cFreedom,\u201d instantly immersing listeners in a rich and invigorating sound. The album, released this year, packs a powerful punch that is vibrant, complex and uniquely its own.\nLaws of Gravity manages to encapsulate the traditions of bluegrass while merging it with modern grooves and instrumentation. The bright movements of Jeremy Garrett\u2019s fiddle and Chris Pandolfi\u2019s banjo sing across the soundscape of bass, dobro, and guitar for a symphony that shines with and without the engaging and lively lyrics.\nWhen the lyrics do fade away, listeners enjoy the intricate improvisational jamming that is a hallmark of The Infamous Stringdusters. Laws of Gravity has a life of its own that proves once again why the band continues to be a resounding favorite across the genre\u2019s fanbase.\nThe Muscle Shoals Recordings by The Steeldrivers\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Blueberry Headband\nThe Muscle Shoals Recordings starts with light, happy banjo on the track \u201cLong Way Down,\u201d setting the tone for an album that combines the essence of bluegrass with rich complexity. Gary Nichols\u2019 distinct and powerful voice, often accompanied by beautiful backing vocals, cruises effortlessly across the instrumentation and inspires with its authenticity and depth.\nThe Steeldrivers feature banjo, mandolin, guitar, bass, and fiddle for a full and delightfully classic bluegrass feel. The Muscle Shoals Recordings, produced in 2015, is the band\u2019s fourth album and earned them a Grammy in the Best Bluegrass category.\nFrom the first track to the last, this is a spirited album that uplifts the mind and moves the body with energetic sound.\n\nThief by Keller & The Keels\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lodi Dodi\nWith a distinctly joyful beat, Thief picks you up and whisks you off into a dance of folky bluegrass with Keller William\u2019s playful vocals leading the way. Williams is joined by Jenny Keel on upright bass and flat picker Larry Keel. Together, the three bring a decidedly full sound to their latest acoustic album.\nKeller & The Keels have never shied away from creative covers, and Thief, released in 2010, is no exception. Unlike their first album, Grass (released in 2006), Thief does not feature any original songs, focusing solely on covers. The album\u2019s title is an ode to this decision.\nBluegrass versions of Amy Winehouse\u2019s \u201cRehab\u201d and Marcy Playground\u2019s \u201cSex and Candy\u201d are among the familiar but undeniably fresh covers. The tracks allow the listener to immediately jump in and sing along while still being immersed in new tunes and feelings.\nWilliams\u2019 knack for composing solo music lends expertise to the composition of his trio, and as such,\u00a0Thief has an intricacy that is impressive for such a small acoustic group.\nFriends of Fall by Crooked Still\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lemon Drop\nCrooked Still offers a unique bluegrass element that is light, airy, and melodic. Lead singer Aoife O\u2019Donovan\u2019s voice carries across the backdrop of banjo, bass, cello, and fiddle like a shooting star.\nFriends of Fall, released in 2011, brings an ethereal beauty and complexity to the genre of bluegrass. Songs such as \u201cPretty Bird\u201d will stir emotion, while \u201cIt\u2019ll End Too Soon\u201d inspires and invigorates. Often described as \u2018progressive bluegrass\u2019 due to innovative acoustics, Crooked Still\u2019s high-energy sound encourages engagement from the first note to the last thanks to its unique instrumentation.\nFriends of Fall is refreshing and wholly uplifting, carrying the spirit of bluegrass as it soars to new and delightful heights.\n\nLove. Ain\u2019t Love \u00a0by Yonder Mountain String Band\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Afgooey\nLove. Ain\u2019t Love, released this year, is the latest from Yonder Mountain String Band, encompassing a full thirteen tracks of rich and engaging rhythms that will keep you on your toes.\nFeaturing five band members on banjo, bass, fiddle, guitar, and mandolin, Yonder Mountain String Band also has the distinction of all five members acting as vocalists, which allows them to create beautifully layered and rich harmonies.\nOn the other hand, Love. Ain\u2019t Love does not shy away from fully instrumental tracks, such as \u201cFall Outta Line,\u201d which showcases the band\u2019s innovation in its tune. This ability to embrace the full merits of their instrumentation has won YMSB fans across various genres, including those in the jam band scene. When listening to Love. Ain\u2019t Love, one can get lost in the music as it paints stories with and without lyrics.\nLove. Ain\u2019t Love provides a playful, energetic, and creative soundscape. The passion and vibrancy in every note of the album act as joyful reminders that Yonder Mountain String Band continues to inspire and be inspired by bluegrass, even 18 years after the release of their first album.",

            "text": "Mix together American roots music such as bluegrass, rhythm and blues, country, and folk, then stir in a hearty portion of down-to-earth charisma, et voil\u00e0: Americana music. At its heart, Americana has a deeply rustic feel, and exists at the intersection of some or all of these classic roots genres. It\u2019s the kind of music that paints a grand picture of open country, roaming plains and old American charm.\n\nAmericana is special not only because it acts as the child of so many other beloved genres, but because it exemplifies the blending of the old with the new. It has the capacity to uplift and energize while spilling over with honest emotion, creating a sound that is both deeply human and largely joyful. We recommend gathering your favorite people, rolling a fat joint, and exploring the following Americana albums as you nestle into an elevated state of mind.\nLeaving Eden by Carolina Chocolate Drops\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Blueberry Pie\nLeaving Eden is at once up-on-your-feet, slap-your-knee, circle-swinging-dance music. But in the next breath it is also soft, heartfelt and gentle. This album can make you feel like you\u2019re stepping back in time to rediscover the quintessential idea of old folk roots music\u2014as with the song \u201cBoodle-De-Bum-Bum\u201d\u2014but the very next song \u201cCountry Girl\u201d will yank you out of the reverie and thrust you into the present with its upbeat, modern vibes and vocals. The title track \u201cLeaving Eden\u201d encourages reflection and a release of emotion with its gentle purring.\nCarolina Chocolate Drops is comprised of Hubby Jenkins, Rowan Corbett, Malcolm Parson, and Rhiannon Giddens, with Giddens\u2019 powerful yet delicate vocals often at the forefront of their sound. Between the four of them is a wide variety of instrumentation including guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle, kazoo, drum, djembe, and cello. This album has a full, intricate sound that shifts and changes with each track, allowing it to hold its listener\u2019s attention effortlessly.\nThe Carrier by Dirtwire\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lucid Dream\nThis is not your traditional Americana. The Carrier is fresh and modern with a vibrant, dirty sound that lives up to the band\u2019s name. Their unique perspective on Americana often features influences from Eastern, African, and South American music threaded throughout. Comprised of David Satori (Beats Antique), Evan Fraser (Hamsa Lila; Bolo), and Mark Reveley (Jed and Lucia), the band describes their music as \u201ca rebirth of Americana and a post-millennial psychedelic journey to downhome goodness.\u201d\nNo two songs are quite alike on this almost exclusively instrumental album. From \u201cThe Well,\u201d featuring Rising Appalachia, to the aptly named \u201cLast Call,\u201d with its sleepy afternoon vibe, The Carrier invites listeners to dive deep into a world with truth and whimsical fancy married together in happy harmony.\n\nBest Of Old Crow Medicine Show by Old Crow Medicine Show\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Huckleberry\nBest Of Old Crow Medicine Show starts off with \u201cWagon Wheel,\u201d a song co-written with Bob Dylan. He first developed the chorus in 1973, 25 years before Old Crow Medicine Show added verses and finalized the song. The classic, like much of Old Crow Medicine Show\u2019s music, tells a lyrical story that is set to a distinctly old-timey country-bluegrass-folk sound.\nOCMS features guitar, banjo, standup bass, fiddle, harmonica, mandolin, drums, and keys, among many other instruments. The result of so much instrumental combination is a wonderfully rich, full sound that is as fanciful as it is familiar. Best Of Old Crown Medicine Show is a farmer on a front porch, a half-empty whiskey bottle, dusty boots, and sunflower fields for miles. It would be a challenge to listen to it without cracking a smile.\nCaptain Nowhere by Railroad Earth\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lemon Drop\nCaptain Nowhere is beautiful, heartfelt, and earthy. The album combines elements of folk, roots, country, bluegrass, and even jazz to create an Americana sound with a life of its own. Todd Sheaffer\u2019s vocals, together with the album\u2019s lyricism, evoke nostalgia, emotion, and at times yearning, which together paint Captain Nowhere\u2019s unique soundscape with true-to-life human elements.\nKnown for improvisation, Railroad Earth\u2019s jam band version of Americana brings a fresh take to the genre, as seen in their song \u201cThe Berkley Flash,\u201d which delves into instrumentation that breathes and moves like white clouds on a windy day. All in all, Captain Nowhere leads the listener across vast waters of roots sound that will delight, uplift, and inspire\u2014just like its strain pairing.\n\nWider Circles by Rising Appalachia\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Blue Mystic\nWider Circles is ethereal, light, heartfelt, and raw. Multi-instrumentalist sister duo Leah and Chloe Smith combine their unique sound with strong, harmonious vocals and creative, original lyrics. Wider Circles blends all these talents beautifully, as the album leads the listener down a gentle river of sound that flows softly together even as it twists and turns along the way.\nWorking in conjunction with an array of fellow musicians, the Smith sisters are able to incorporate a wide range of instruments including (but not limited to) banjos, fiddles, drums, congas, djembe, tablas, and even a washboard. The result is music that is folksy yet worldly and filled to the brim with life. Wider Circles will inspire, delight, and encourage movement of both body and mind.",

            "text": "I additionally used this strain to unwind because I was tired of working on an extensive policy brief due the next day, so I decided to kick back and vape a little lemon drop. when I was done, all I wanted to do was work!! this could be big pharmas worst enemy when it comes to ADD!! Adderall? forget it, this is much more fun and efficient. 4/5, I feel like the high doesn't last as long as other top shelfs. tastes like lemony goodness. I think it'd be cool to put lemon Gatorade in a bong and smoke lemon drop, probably a solid flavor profile. anyways I'm rambling. Taste through the vape was 5/5. straight terps, big milky hits should send a tingling sensation down your body. recommended for daytime use, highly functional, but also a great go to if you wanna kick back and watch Netflix. definitely sativa dominant tho. why? because it's fucking 4 am and I have to get up in less than 4 hours and I'm writing an intricate pot review instead of sleeping",
