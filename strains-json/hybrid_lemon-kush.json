            "text": "There\u2019s something about settling down with your favorite video game and a bowl of your go-to strain ready at your side. Cannabis can be a magnificent companion to the virtual world, so we dug into Leafly\u2019s strain reviews to find out which games were most cherished and how different varieties affected your abilities and experiences.\nWhat Cannabis Strains Do You Pair with Video Games?\nWe mapped the relationship between different video games and their strain reviews (click on the below image to enlarge it) to see which strains were connected to popular video games.\n\nClick on the image for a full-sized version.\nEach connection represents Leafly visitors\u2019 strain reviews mentioning specific video game titles. Both the Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto franchises are the obvious favorites, with Sour Diesel and Durban Poison acting as the bridges between them.\nSpeaking of Sour Diesel, this consumer favorite is unsurprisingly also a go-to for gaming, as it\u2019s connected to six titles. But were these strain selections actually a good pairing with these games, or did they lead to consumer regret? Let\u2019s take a look at what some of you reviewers said about them.\nCannabis Strains That Helped Gamers Focus\nThere\u2019s nothing quite like plopping down with your favorite video game and feeling completely immersed in it, thanks to the help of a good focusing strain. Here are a couple strains our reviewers called out as performance enhancers:\n Fruity Pebbles\n\u201cI also did fucking great at [Call of Duty] afterwards, which usually takes an act of God. So studies may prove that this stuff improves your video game skills.\u201d\n Diablo\n\u201cMy girlfriend and I cleaned the whole house and also beat some long standing high scores on Rock Band.\u201d\nLooking for cannabis strains to help you stay on your game? Check out this list of all focusing strains on Leafly.\nCannabis Strains That Were Paired with Creative Gaming\nAnother way cannabis and video games pair beautifully is through creativity. Many games have a creative component that cannabis can cater to, whether you\u2019re exploring the wastelands of Fallout, building mods for Skyrim, or constructing a glorious palace for yourself in Minecraft.\n Green Crack\n\u201cGave me inspiration. Had a lot of fun playing Skyrim on my PC and modding the hell out of it.\u201d\nWhat other strains can help pique your creativity in the virtual realms? Refer to Leafly\u2019s full list of creative strains to find out.\nCannabis Strains That Were Too Distracting for Gamers\nFor every strain that boosts creativity and focus, you know there\u2019s another one to throw off your groove completely. It may be that heavy indica that defeats your sense of purpose in the game, or that buzzing sativa that keeps your focus jumping from one irrelevant detail to the next. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the struggles our Leafly reviewers endured:\n GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\n\u201cBe careful because if you play Call of Duty, you\u2019re gonna be running into a shit ton of walls.\u201d\n Purple Urkle\n\u201cI normally play Madden way better stoned but on this stuff I suck. I get confused real easy on it.\u201d\nCannabis Strains That Blew Gamers\u2019 Minds\nLeave it to cannabis to ensure you have a great time even when you\u2019re beyond your ability to operate a controller. These reviewers prove that sometimes it isn\u2019t always about winning, it\u2019s about having fun.\n Cherry Pie\n\u201cWe smoke a bowl and in a few minutes Mario Kart is like the best thing on the planet.\u201d\n Lemon Kush\n\u201cGreat for playing video games. I smoked a bowl and sat in front of a towel trying to move it with my mind for an hour. Played GTA V after smoking a ton of this, so much fun. Drove around the countryside for hours.\u201d\nWhat are the Most Popular Video Games According to Leafly Visitors?\nThe below graph shows which games were most commonly talked about in Leafly cannabis strain reviews. The larger the bubble, the more popular the game. Call of Duty is king, with Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto, and Skyrim close behind. These games are popular in their own right, but based on our user reviews, cannabis sure brings something special to the experience, too.\n\nClick to enlarge.\nWhich Cannabis Strains are Most Popularly Paired with Video Games?\nIt should come as no surprise that Blue Dream, Sour Diesel, Green Crack, and AK-47 are among the most popular video game partner strains \u2013 they\u2019re some of the more prolific varieties available. But it also makes sense that these classics pair so well with video games when you look at their effect profiles.\nBlue Dream and AK-47 offer a balance of relaxation and creativity, while other sativas like Sour Diesel and Green Crack provide cerebral energy and focus. Even heavy indicas like Bubba Kush and Northern Lights have something to offer gamers chasing a blissful couchlock feeling that lets you ease yourself into a fully immersive experience.\nThe below chart indicates the most popular cannabis strains for playing video games. The larger the bubble, the more frequently that strain is consumed when gaming. And, of course, each bubble\u2019s color is designated by which strain type it is, with red representing sativa strains, purple representing indica strains, and green representing hybrid strains.\n\nClick to enlarge.\nWhich Video Game Genres are Most Popular Among Cannabis Consumers?\nIf you\u2019re curious as to which genres are preferred among cannabis, consumers, we broke the data out into a pie chart. Shooter games were the clear favorite, followed by action/adventure and role-playing games.\n\nClick to enlarge.\nThis breakdown differs from 2014 statistics via the Entertainment Software Association, which had action games as the most popular genre at 28.2% and shooter titles in second place at 21.7%. Their stats looked more like this:\n\nAction and adventure: 34.2% (we combined action, which had 28.2%, with adventure, which was broken out as a separate genre at 6%)\nShooter: 21.7%\nSports: 13.3%\nRole-playing: 9.5%\nFighting: 6%\n\nWhich Game Ratings are the Most Popular Among Cannabis Consumers?\nUnsurprisingly, with shooter games being the most popular among Leafly\u2019s cannabis consumers, games rated \u201cM\u201d for \u201cMature\u201d (meaning the content is suitable for players ages 17 and up) were similarly the most popular rating at 54%.\nHowever, titles rated \u201cE\u201d for \u201cEveryone\u201d (meaning all ages) came in second, which may seem remarkable at first until you consider that many gamers who settle in with with a packed strain in one hand and a controller in the other could be looking to relax and have fun playing a game that doesn\u2019t require excessive concentration, skill, or experience. It\u2019s no fun getting your ass kicked while poorly playing an impaired game of Call of Duty, but button mashing through a round of Super Smash Bros. or warbling through \u201cBlitzkrieg Bop\u201d when playing Rock Band with friends can be entertaining even if you\u2019re sucking it up. (Note that Leafly.com requires its visitors to be at least 21 years of age or a legal, valid medical marijuana patient.)\n\nClick to enlarge.\nWhich Game Platforms are the Most Popular Among Cannabis Consumers?\nLastly, we analyzed the most popular gaming platforms according to our cannabis consumers.\n\nClick to enlarge.\nXbox is the most popular gaming platform, with Playstation firmly in second place, PC games in third, and Nintendo bringing up the rear. However, when it came to the console wars, our reviewers don\u2019t specify which generation console they\u2019re using. In actuality, the\u00a0Nintendo Wii actually sold more units than either the Xbox 360 or the Playstation 3, and lifetime sales of each platform\u2019s newest generation console (the Xbox One, Playstation 4, and Wii U) through February 2015 were as follows:\n\nPlaystation 4: 19,052,353\nXbox One: 11,298,462\nWii U: 9,137,844\n\nTime for you to weigh in! Which video games do enjoy most while high, and what cannabis strains make them even better?",

Leafly and\u00a0General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Lemon Kush\u2019s well-rounded high and pleasing citrus aroma lend to sharpened creativity and an enhanced mood. Alien Genetics is responsible for creating this masterpiece strain, by crossing Lemon G with classic Afghan Kush. While Alien\u2019s strain is no longer available in seed or clone form, another Lemon Kush \u2014 a cross between Master Kush and Lemon Joy with similar effects and aroma \u2014 is.\nGrow Techniques: Growing outdoors in quality, complex soil brings out the strong lemon scent.

            "text": "=About It:=\nLemon is ever so present all throughout. The nugs smell strongly of Lemon. The nugs are SO tightly compact - THEY SNOKE YOU, you do not smoke them! Lemon aftertaste is very strong in the mouth! That is saying something given it's THAT present through the smoke. A strain that will cause dry-mouth (no cotton mouth). VERY heavy sedation, novice users start slowly with dosage.\n\n=Medical=\nThe heavy sedation mentioned is mostly felt in the back mussels, not felt as heavily below the waist. Motor coordination in waist and below is not affected, however there is light sedation in that region. Relives the pain of IBS completely for me. \n\n=Effects=\nFeeling of being light and floaty. The onset effects are tingling in the upper back predominantly the spinal column and the nerves around it. Feel \"Ready for a good time\". Very mellow and relaxed. Upon moderate to high dosages you get the following effects:\n-\n1) Feel physically dis-assocated with the real worldn(feels more spiritual).\n2) Heavy sedation (\"couch lock\").\n3) Massively spacing out\nNot a good strain for getting things done.\nAfter 45 minutes you just want to sit back, relax, and just hang out. Great for watching movies.\nAgain, novice users start out slow until you get the hang of this one.",
