            "text": "First time reviewer here. Lemon OG haze has landed itself in my personal top three favorite MMJ Sativa strains that I've had the pleasure of smoking.  If you keep your buds in mason jars, you're going to have to control yourself from opening the jar just to take a whiff of that semi sweet, citrusy smell that puts a smile on your face every time. You can even taste a hint of lemon every time you inhale.  \n\nUsually when people think of Sativa strains, they think of daytime medicating, but this strain is so good, I'd recommend it anytime of the day.  Lemon OG Haze makes me feel wonderful, completely happy, and mentally sharp, allowing me to do my daily routines without hindering my performance like a strong Indica strain might do, and at night when I'm tired, it gives me the tired silly high that makes me giggle and laugh until it's time to go to sleep. \n\nHalfway through medicating I find myself smiling and feeling overjoyed, and that alone makes the strain so amazing to me. Definitely a five star strain. If I could I'd always have some of this around.",
