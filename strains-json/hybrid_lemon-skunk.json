This strain is amazing in it\u0027s appearance, smell and effects. It\u0027s name is a little off as there is definitely a large percent of limonene for the \"lemon\" in the name but there wasn\u0027t any skunk to it, at least not what I\u0027m used to and I\u0027m comparing it to the original skunks of the late 80\u0027s and early 90\u0027s. It\u0027s definitely a sativa dominant strain with the nice compact buds with lots of trichomes and red hairs. It\u0027s effects are all sativa as well. Smokes very smooth and has a great fruity smell and taste so you can enjoy hit after hit. It\u0027s a great daytime strain that will definitely uplift and energize you.

This strain is amazing in it\u0027s appearance, smell and effects. It\u0027s name is a little off as there is definitely a large percent of limonene for the \"lemon\" in the name but there wasn\u0027t any skunk to it, at least not what I\u0027m used to and I\u0027m comparing it to the original skunks of the late 80\u0027s and early 90\u0027s. It\u0027s definitely a sativa dominant strain with the nice compact buds with lots of trichomes and red hairs. It\u0027s effects are all sativa as well. Smokes very smooth and has a great fruity smell and taste so you can enjoy hit after hit. It\u0027s a great daytime strain that will definitely uplift and energize you. This is actually one that I wouldn\u0027t recommend of night time use as you may not sleep. I plan to grow this over the next 6 months and will review my experience with it then.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"},{"id":1642611,"username":"RGreenB","text":"First review ever!

Leafly and Botanicare are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Lemon Skunk was created in Amsterdam by crossing two different Skunk varieties. It took off as a popular strain with growers and consumers for its high yield and quality buds. This hybrid’s lemony, earthy flavor prefaces an uplifting and energizing high.\nGrow Techniques: This plant needs room to grow vertically. If growing indoors, use either soil or hydroponic setups, but switch your plant to flowering before they grow too big. Outdoors, this plant will take off in the sun and produce large yields. Have trellising in place to support the buds and branches as they stretch. \nFlowering Time: 8-9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Easy to moderate\nClimate: Lemon Skunk can handle wetter and more humid climates due to its sativa bud structure. It prefers temperatures between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.  \nIndoor/Outdoor: Grows best outdoors where the plant can reach its fullest potential. Lemon Skunk can grow just fine indoors, but space can become an issue.\nFeeding: If growing outside, start with healthy soils and feed with compost teas. Top-dress with diverse nutrients throughout the season. Indoors, this strain can take moderate feedings.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/31171714/lemon-skunk-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-lemon-skunk-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":764,"flavors":[{"name":"Lemon","score":42.270440346029076},{"name":"Citrus","score":19.665234891265168},{"name":"Skunk","score":18.242545756738359},{"name":"Earthy","score":10.721744963755057},{"name":"Sweet","score":9.26641535504025}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":48.8943790299972},{"name":"Uplifted","score":48.28815230886299},{"name":"Euphoric","score":40.252337898994753},{"name":"Energetic","score":39.061235932556372},{"name":"Creative","score":35.896386519283908}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":22.009942328487323},{"name":"Pain","score":18.184123312908007},{"name":"Depression","score":17.204458528575437},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":9.6001541911970847},{"name":"Headaches","score":7.9125365453161924}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":16.228047779246264},{"name":"PTSD","score":9.32088289478954},{"name":"Tinnitus","score":4.3046627818494931},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","score":3.8436911770595539},{"name":"Epilepsy","score":3.6440436140814612}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":24.909788137290242},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":17.135222676118385},{"name":"Anxious","score":8.55846249349193},{"name":"Dizzy","score":4.5842845127958665},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.889182586407145}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/lemon-skunk/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/hybrid/lemon-skunk/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-skunk_100x100_358e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000280/b/lemon-skunk__primary_065f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-skunk_100x100_8e11.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000279/b/lemon-skunk__primary_e074.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-skunk_100x100_0e8f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/709166/b/lemon-skunk__primary_6dba.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-skunk_100x100_7dda.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/657487/b/lemon-skunk__primary_6ce0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-skunk_100x100_5411.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/640971/b/lemon-skunk__primary_f789.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-skunk_100x100_878f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/609514/b/lemon-skunk__primary_e671.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":172,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Denver, CO","Las Vegas, NV","Eugene, OR","China","Montréal, QC","Calgary, AB","San Francisco, CA","Toronto, ON","Bend, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-skunk","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.31151832460733/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Skunk #1","subtitle":null,"slug":"skunk-1","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1","symbol":"Sk1","applink":"leafly://strain/skunk-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":63,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tHigh calyx-to-leaf ratio makes for easy trimming\n\tGrows best as a multi-branch plant\n\tDoes well with moderate to heavy nutrients\n\tYields typically fall between 400-500g/m\u0026sup2;\n\n"}}
