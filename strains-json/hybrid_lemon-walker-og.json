The high is very uplifting and relaxing, without being to sedative. Surprisingly, it doesn't taste anything like it smells. It tastes more like O.G. than anything. The mood lift is quite noticeable, giddy at times with an overall positive sense of well being. Highly recommended. Myrcene 4.96 mg/g, Limonene: 1.73 mg/g, b-Caryophyllene 1.1 mg/g.",
