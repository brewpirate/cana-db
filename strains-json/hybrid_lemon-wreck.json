            "text": "If you are looking for a powerful sativa, look no further. It's not the type of strain that's going to relax you, it's going to send you on a borderline psychedelic soul-searching look at yourself. If you are susceptible to paranoia in weed, this strain will most definitely cause it. I brought some to a rave, and while it was super intense along with the k I did, it wasn't enjoyable. I was super paranoid and that got in the way of me soaking in just how trippy the effects were. It reminded me of why I'm an indica person. Even though the strain wasn't for me, it was good for what it was which is why I gave it 4 stars. I'd rather have strong weed that doesn't fit with my personality than weak weed that doesn't do anything. My final advice: If you are a sativa person, you'll really dig this stuff. If you have anxiety like me, tread lightly.",
