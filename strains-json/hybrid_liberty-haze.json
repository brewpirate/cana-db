Are you hungry yet?\n\n\nOkay I smoked a few bongs rips of this, and my girlfriend was completely toasted like the meatball sub at Subway. Honestly, roasted like a Jetpuffed Marshmallow. Seriously baked like an apple pie on July 4th, with fireworks blasting overhead. It was extremely patriotic. Entirely cooked. \u2013jamesm0792\n\n\u00a0\nPonder the big questions this Independence Day:\n\n\nI would recommend smoking this with some friends who want to talk about the universe or why exit signs are green in America and Red in Canada. \u2013dustrox\n\n\u00a0\nDo you want to feel like an American hero and get the girl? A lofty goal, but maybe this strain could help:\n\n\nHOLY SHIT, I feel like CAPTAIN AMERICA!!! Is that freedom I smell? Wow, what an amazing, intense high\u2026 Even the body effects make you feel like a superhero! Everything is heightened. Euphoric. Laid back, easy-going. Relaxed, but still alert and ready for action! Save the day and get the girl, hell yes!! Don't forget the victory party! Oh, and by the way, it's not paranoia that some of you are feeling a hint of. No my friends, that's you looking for any excuse to save the day. Ha! No negative side effects here! \u2013Cannadise\n\n\u00a0\nAnd last, but not least, if you can\u2019t find a patriotic strain, settle for one that will leave you feeling grand:\n\n\nIf you aren't able to find any of the patriotic ones during the 4th of July, then get this stuff to make the day grand. \u2013JohnnySativa420",
