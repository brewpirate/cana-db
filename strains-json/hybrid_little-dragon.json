Cerebral and uplifting lineage from Thailand and Africa along with the classic OG KUSH  to bring it down to a hybrid level and make this an amazing relaxing strain for the daytime and evening! This strain is good for anytime except for before sleep because of the landrace genetics. The buds have that classic OG Kush build with dark orange hairs! But there covered in Thc crystals! With a few noticeable dark green leaves that add to its uniqueness. I don\u0027t go easy on too many strains by giving it 5 stars but this one deserve it. Definitely one to try out.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1568023,"username":"Airframer","text":"Very nice mellow high. Movies are funnier, food is more delicious, and bed is so much more comfortable. Perfect for couch-locked, binge-watching-Netflix-type evenings.\nI would absolutely NOT recommend this strain if you\u0027re about to mount a very heavy, very delicate plasma TV (as I tried to do after smoking the first time).  I had asked my budtender for a heady sativa that wouldn\u0027t make me pass out like a lot of indicas do and she recommended this. Now, while I don\u0027t usually pass out after smoking Lil D, I would still not recommend it when physical tasks need to be performed.\nBut, for what it is, it is very good. 9/10 would recommend.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3331","title":"New Strains Alert: Legendary Lemon, Larry Bird Kush, Agent Tangie, and More","author":"Jeremiah Wilhelm","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1469221200000)\/","text":"This week at Leafly we\u0027ve added an assortment of great strains. Inside this stanky goody bag you\u0027ll find an 80\u0027s sitcom star, a hacktivist group, a tiny mythological lizard, a member of the 1992 Olympic \"Dream Team,\" an agent, a lady, and a lemon that can only be described as \"legendary.\" Enjoy this week\u0027s New Strains Alert and if you\u0027ve had the pleasure of trying any of these strains, stop by and share your experiences here.\n \n  Legendary Lemon\n\nLegendary Lemon is a sativa-dominant strain that blends two Mexican speed demons, Zacatecas and Oaxaca, with two zesty zingers, Lemon Skunk and Lemon Kush. This tangy bud hits hard with a strong cerebral buzz and offers whimsical euphoria that makes consumers feel light on their feet. Enjoy this strain to defeat depression or to frontload strong mood enhancing effects. The flavor has been described as “rich lemon custard.\"\n\n \n  Larry Bird Kush\n\nLarry Bird Kush is a nearly perfect 50/50 hybrid strain named after the famous Boston Celtics basketball player. This strain combines Sunset Sherbet and Thin Mint GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) from the famous West Coast tastemakers Cookie Fam Genetics. The aroma of “The Great White Hope” is thick with sweet grape tang reminiscent of Grape Crush. Deep purple sugar leaves and a dense layer of trichomes illustrate the strain’s indica parentage. LBK’s effects are more uplifting and heady, making it a perfect strain for consumers looking for an indica flavor and smell while retaining physical sativa effects.\n\n \n  Agent Tangie\n\nFor those craving a cerebral buzz with a citrus kick, 3C Agent Tangie is perfect. The glittery colas are light green with a zesty, floral flavor. Its effects linger in the crown of the skull and disperse throughout the body in steady waves of invigoration. This strain may assist those suffering from perpetual procrastination, depression, and fatigue.\n\n \n  Anonymous OG\n\nThe 3C Anonymous OG greets the nose with distinctive woodsy, citrus, diesel scent that indica connoisseurs all know and love. Anonymous OG is a 3C Farms select cut of 3C Kushishima. Its round dense buds are wrapped in deep green calyxes that drip with resin and glitter with trichomes. The flavor is deep, satisfying the most refined palate. This strain is incredibly relaxing and sedative, and should be consumed in the evening for best results.\n\n \n  Chloe\n\nChloe is a powerful and mysterious sativa-dominant hybrid created by Chris Wren of Medizin, Las Vegas. This strain won 1st place at the International Cannagraphic Magazine Cup in 2015 and has since gone on to accrue local renown and praise for its incredible medicinal qualities. Even though this strain leans 60/40 sativa-dominant, it possesses potency and physical sedation that can lull the most experienced person to sleep with continued consumption. Chloe is also a welcome companion for patients seeking relief from a wide variety of ailments, including loss of appetite and chronic pain.\n\n \n  Little Dragon\n\nLittle Dragon offers a more citrus-forward Kush experience, blending OG Kush, Colombian, and Thai genetics. While OG Kush anchors the physical effects with mid-level pain relief and a general heaviness in the limbs, the Central American and Southeast Asian genetics explode on the palate and offer complementary mental stimulation. Enjoy Little Dragon as a functional analgesic strain that shows off its flavorful exotic roots on the exhale.\n\n \n  Webster\n\nWebster is a stimulating sativa with uplifting elements off the get-go. This strain is immediately motivating, encouraging physical activity from chores to hitting the gym. Flavors of citrus and sweetness are noted on the exhale, and are accompanied by appetite stimulation and an “empty-head” type of stress relief. Webster is ideal for consumers suffering from stress and fatigue, but should be avoided before bed.\n\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12002220/new-strains-alert-legendary-lemon-larry-bird-kush-agent-tangie-an.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-legendary-lemon-larry-bird-kush-agent-tangie-an"}],"reviewCount":5,"flavors":[{"name":"Mint","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Pungent","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Woody","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Citrus","score":22.916666666666664},{"name":"Mango","score":22.916666666666664}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":39.583333333333329},{"name":"Happy","score":39.583333333333329},{"name":"Relaxed","score":39.583333333333329},{"name":"Uplifted","score":22.916666666666664},{"name":"Talkative","score":16.666666666666664}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Fatigue","score":22.916666666666664},{"name":"Inflammation","score":22.916666666666664},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":22.916666666666664},{"name":"Pain","score":22.916666666666664},{"name":"Stress","score":22.916666666666664}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":22.916666666666664},{"name":"Arthritis","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Hypertension","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":6.25},{"name":"Anorexia","score":6.25}],"negatives":[],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/little-dragon_100x100_3962.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619002/b/little-dragon__primary_f837.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/little-dragon_100x100_557e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619343/b/little-dragon__primary_3f60.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/little-dragon_100x100_7793.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619342/b/little-dragon__primary_b125.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":3,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/little-dragon","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.2/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"},{"name":"Central American","subtitle":null,"slug":"central-american","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/central-american","symbol":"Cam","applink":"leafly://strain/central-american"},{"name":"Thai","subtitle":null,"slug":"thai","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/thai","symbol":"Tha","applink":"leafly://strain/thai"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
