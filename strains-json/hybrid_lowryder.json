Lowryder is a stalwart plant that can survive in harsh, colder climates, making it a popular strain in northern regions like Finland and Canada.\u003c/p\u003e\n","descriptionPlain":"Lowryder is a hybrid strain that was inbred for nine generations by Joint Doctor Seeds to give it a dwarfed size. Growing no more than 16 inches tall, it\u0026#39;s the cannabis equivalent of a bonsai for the discrete grower\u0026rsquo;s windowsill or balcony. Lowryder\u0026rsquo;s small size comes from a species of cannabis ruderalis crossed with Northern Lights #2 and then William\u0026rsquo;s Wonder. Consumers, be patient with this strain: its medicinal and cerebrally stimulating effects have a slow but powerful onset. A mild earthy aroma radiates from the small, conic buds which autoflower in a short 40 to 45 days.

In honor of Canada Day and the promising strides the country has made towards nationwide legalization, here are 11 strains with Canadian roots. Pick one up and raise a joint to celebrate the friendly Canucks up north!\n \n  Manitoba Poison\nThe Manitoba province is located at the longitudinal center of Canada, so it\u0027s only fitting that Manitoba Poison is a 50/50 hybrid (though you\u0027ll likely feel the heavy indica properties pretty quickly).\n  Sweet Tooth\nAn oldie but a goodie, Sweet Tooth won 1st Place in the 2001 High Times Cannabis Cup.\n  Mendocino Purps\nMendocino Purps, or simply \"The Purps,\" is one of a few living legends that made this list. Handed off as a clone-only cut, this plant was stabilized by BC Bud Depot and has since made its way around the world. \n  Chemo\nChemo, or UBC Chemo, is named for the university where the strain was allegedly created and for its supplementary effects on patients going through chemotherapy. This strain is an international treasure with origins that reach back to the 1970s.\n  M-39\nThe clever astronomical designation of M-39 speaks to the Northern Light #5 portion of this cross. \n  God Bud\nGod Bud is some of the finest around. This incredible indica-dominant strain lives in the pantheon of cannabis deities, but like many of the old gods, this strain is the primogenitor to many other floral demigods like Blue God and Grape God.\n  DJ Short Blueberry\nDJ Short is one of the principal breeders in the cannabis industry. With cuts like Juicy Fruit and Flo, he\u0027s left a lasting mark on the cannabis industry with exotic genetic crosses cultivated through a life of world travel and reverence for this resinous flower. DJ Short Blueberry is known as THE west coast Blueberry phenotype.\n  Blue Dynamite\nBlue Dynamite was featured as one of the top 10 strains of 2007 in High Times magazine. \n  Island Sweet Skunk\nBred by Federation Seed Company in Canada, this beautiful blend of strong landrace genetics offers a smoke that is stimulating and versatile. Known for creating considerable amounts of tertiary CBD, Island Sweet Skunk invigorates the user while still offering anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.\n  Lowryder\nLowryder is a squat and resilient plant that is ideal for outdoor grows in less than pleasant climates, making it a seasoned fit for Canadians seeking a plant that could grow and hide in plain sight while weathering a rugged season. \n  Romulan\nRomulan is a space-age indica sent to Earth to expand our mind. And with Canada\u0027s savvy immigration policy, it\u0027s no wonder this heady smoker stopped there first.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12001518/cannabis-strains-with-canadian-roots.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/cannabis-strains-with-canadian-roots"},{"id":"contentitems-3101","title":"Five New Cannabis Strains with Canadian Origins","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1391533200000)\/","text":"Some of the best cannabis strains we enjoy today migrated from the growers and seed banks of Canada.
