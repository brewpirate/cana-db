This strain is very delightful and fulfilling. It scores big in taste, it slam dunks with power,  and the medical benefits are a homerun! This is a very social strain, and women love its fruity smell and flavor. It takes two too Mango Tango so let's cut a bud. I recommend trying this strain if you ever come across it. ",
