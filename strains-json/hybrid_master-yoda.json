            "text": "April 20th, or \"4/20\", is a day of celebration in the cannabis industry, and most consumers spent the day doing just that: consuming! We asked Leafly users on social media how they\u2019d be spending the holiday, and the responses painted a colorful list of strains spanning the spectrum from euphoria-inducing sativas to pain-relieving indicas.\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of what Leafly users consumed on this year's 4/20:\n\u00a0\nGranddaddy Purple\n\nGranddaddy Purple, the famous cross of Purple Urkle and Big Bud, is a California staple that can be found all along the west coast. With a sweet grape and berry aroma, this powerful indica exhibits potent psychoactive effects that are felt in both the mind and body. Those who consumed GDP on 4/20 likely found their minds drifting toward a cerebral bliss while their bodies were firmly locked to the couch.\n\u00a0\nJack Diesel\n\nIf you consumed Jack Diesel for the holiday, you were in for an exciting, energetic day. Jack Diesel is a\u00a0cross of Jack Herer and NYC Diesel that brings on potent, long-lasting sativa effects. What begins as an uplifting buzz gives way to immediate relaxation, followed by an energetic, creative rush. A great choice for those who spent the day at events!\n\u00a0\nJack Herer\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be an activist to appreciate the blissful, clear-headed, creative effects of Jack Herer. Named for Jack Herer, the marijuana activist and author of The Emperor Wears No Clothes, this strain offers cerebral elevation while also boasting the heavy resin of indicas. Those who consumed Jack Herer for 4/20 were in for a day of truly joyous, energetic celebration!\n\u00a0\nMango\n\nDon\u2019t let Mango's namesake\u00a0orange coloring fool you: this strain is indica all the way. If you smoked, vaporized, or otherwise consumed Mango on 4/20, you no doubt felt a wave of relaxation kick in almost immediately. Soothing relaxation quickly gives way to a blissful euphoria, leaving\u00a0you ready and willing to celebrate even more!\n\u00a0\nMaster Yoda\n\nHad\u00a0a wonderful and relaxing 4/20 with Master Yoda, you did. This mostly indica buzz is peppered with an uplifting sativa balance that blends creativity and euphoria with the relaxing indica properties. The force is strong with this strain, and we have no doubt it enabled a truly other-worldly 4/20!\n\u00a0\nNorthern Lights\n\nNorthern Lights is another strain best consumed by those who observed the holiday from the comforts of home. One of the most famous and beloved strains of all time, it exhibits pungently sweet, spicy aromas that radiate from\u00a0crystal-coated buds. Northern Lights'\u00a0pronounced relaxing effects resonate throughout the body, soothing muscles and calming the mind into blissful euphoria.\n\u00a0\nPlatinum GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\n\nPlatinum GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) is just the trick for patients who wanted to celebrate the holiday while also relieving their severe pain, nausea, swelling, migraines, or stress. After filling your nose with a berry sweetness, the effects of this strain melt away physical and mental symptoms of stress, leaving your mind clear and your body ready to celebrate 4/20 pain-free.\n\u00a0\nSour Diesel\n\nKnown for its happy, uplifting euphoria, Sour Diesel is a great choice for patients and recreational consumers alike. Those who rung in the holiday with this strain were treated to fast-acting energy and dreamy cerebral effects that lasted throughout the day. A perfect choice for 4/20!\n\u00a0\nSour Kush\n\nSour Kush is a citrus-flavored hybrid offers the best of both worlds: it provides consumers an uplifting experience without overwhelming sedative effects, but it also delivers powerful pain relief. For this reason, it\u2019s a great daytime strain for medical patients seeking relief. On 4/20, Sour Kush\u00a0delivered the pain-relieving qualities you needed without sacrificing your energy.\n\u00a0\nWhite Widow\n\nWhite Widow has achieved worldwide fame and it\u2019s no wonder that Leafly users chose to celebrate the biggest industry holiday with this classic.
