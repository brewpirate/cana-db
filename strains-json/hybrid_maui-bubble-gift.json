            "text": "After you\u2019ve devoured every last ounce of gravy your stomach can handle, doused your pumpkin pie in whipped cream, and are now lying on the couch feeling somewhere between extremely satiated and \"I hate myself,\u201d as Louis CK would put it, I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re thinking what I\u2019m thinking: Some cannabis would be mighty fine right about now.\nAfter a hefty meal loaded with (delicious, delicious) carbs, you\u2019re bound to be feeling bloated, possibly even a little bit nauseous. You think about counteracting your discomfort with some cannabis, but which strains will offer the best digestive aid?\nDon't worry, we're hear to help! Here are some strains to ease your aching tummy after a huge holiday meal.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Thin Mint GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\nThis hybrid cross has some pretty impressive origins \u2013 we all know the famous GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) of legendary status. Cross that with Durban Poison from a continent away in South Africa, and you\u2019ve got a powerhouse combination that will knock any uncomfortable indigestion out solid (although it might knock you out, too). As an added bonus, this strain tastes like a nice minty after-dinner treat!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0SFV OG Kush\nSFV OG Kush is a heavy indica to top all heavy indicas. Of Afghani origins, crossed with OG Kush and SFV OG, this indica has a spicy citrus kick followed by a sleepy stone. Don\u2019t hit this bad boy unless you\u2019re ready to go down for the count.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bay Dream\nLooking for something that\u2019ll settle your tummy but won\u2019t leave you in a coma? Check out this savory sativa. A cross of Blue Dream and Bay 11, Bay Dream has a soothing effect on the stomach, with a cerebral burst of euphoria. This is also an excellent strain if you\u2019re looking for a creative boost to get some work done.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Ringo\u2019s Gift\nRingo's Gift is best for those looking for a dose of pain relief with their relaxation. This peppery strain crosses Harle-Tsu and ACDC for a powerful full-body pain reliever without the stoney couchlock effect. The body buzz is strong, but the cerebral effects are subtle \u2013 you might be talking someone\u2019s ear off for 20 minutes before you notice.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Chemo\nThis strain\u2019s name really says it all. It was conceived to counteract the side effects of chemotherapy, and this is easily the top strain for anyone dealing with nausea, stomach cramping, or a loss of appetite. Keep in mind that Chemo is P-O-T-E-N-T, but it's the perfect choice if you\u2019re looking for a comfy after-dinner snooze.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Blue Hawaiian\nFor a more subtle approach, this combination of the classic Blue Dream and Hawaiian Sativa will smooth out your stomach and give you a happy head high. It's a balanced hybrid, offering a tropical taste of pineapple and a sweet burst of blueberry. After a few puffs, you\u2019ll be feeling super mellow without a care in the world.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Strawberry\nStrawberry flavors highlight another stomach-soothing sativa strain you can try. It's especially good for those who might be prone to anxiety, as Strawberry offers a calm, relaxing buzz without the paranoia that is often common in sativa strains. This one is also a great choice for those who have social anxiety, particularly if your relatives are *ahem* out-staying their welcome.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Pure Kush\nTried and true, this indica is a favorite for those looking to stop their pain dead in its tracks. This is the strain you\u2019ll want if you\u2019re looking to sedate yourself into a sleepy stupor. It starts with a little sativa surge for the first few minutes, followed immediately by a pleasant pressure in your head and face. Once you settle yourself after a little dose of Pure Kush, don\u2019t make any plans because you won\u2019t be moving from your spot for a while.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Maui Bubble Gift\nWith a name like that, this strain sounds a bit discombobulated, but that\u2019s really just because it\u2019s a delightful hybrid composed of the best of all worlds. With origins in Maui Waui, Bubble Gum, and God\u2019s Gift, this strain really is a gift. It's This usually high in CBD, with a pleasantly cerebral buzz from Maui Waui, a blast of pain relief from Bubble Gum, and a gentle, caressing body stone that swoops in at the last minute. Your tummy troubles will soon be forgotten with Maui Bubble Gift!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hashberry\nThis is a nice indica to try as an indigestion aid that won\u2019t knock you out. Hashberry has resinous buds covered in sticky trichomes, so keep in mind that it\u2019s not a strain for beginners. It has a soothing effect on muscles as well as offers full body relaxation while still allowing some degree of sociability. You\u2019ll be giggly and relaxed without being comatose.\nThere you have it! By now, hopefully you've got your feet up, a smile on your face, and are experiencing blissful satisfaction (hopefully while wearing comfy, stretchy pants). Happy Turkey Day!",

            "text": "For some cannabis consumers, the \u201cmunchies,\u201d or appetite stimulation, is an unwanted side effect that can lead to overeating, but for many medical marijuana patients, it provides necessary relief from symptoms like nausea and a lack of appetite. For those of you who consume cannabis as a natural appetite stimulant or to help calm gastrointestinal distress, here are 10 of the many strain varieties that can help kick-start the grumbles in your tummy:\n Goo\nGoo is a fairly heavy indica, so don\u2019t test this strain unless you\u2019re prepared for a strong dose of relaxation with your appetite boost. It also offers relief from painful muscle spasms, making it a good choice for spasticity or for those who suffer from gastrointestinal disorders.\n Monster Cookies\nAnother potent indica, Monster Cookies hails from the favored GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) tribe and offers the same dose of euphoria and relaxation you know and love. The sleepy effects will increase over time, so keep your couch and your munchies close at hand and you\u2019ll be set for the night.\n Maui Bubble Gift\nMaui Bubble Gift is an aromatic hybrid with roots in three distinctively fantastic medicinal strains: Bubble Gum, Maui Waui and God\u2019s Gift. This indica-dominant strain has an unusually high CBD content, which makes it an excellent choice for pain and nausea sufferers. With the mental clarity of Maui Waui, the stomach-soothing spasm relief of Bubble Gum, and the relaxing effects of God\u2019s Gift, this hybrid offers the best of three worlds in one.\n Sonoma Coma\nSonoma Coma is a rare sativa that hails from (where else?) Sonoma County, California. It offers energetic, uplifting effects with a mellow finish and a dash of the munchies to aid a diminished appetite.\n Platinum Purple Kush\nPurple Kush\u2019s beefed-up older brother, Platinum Purple Kush provides deep muscle relaxation while still maintaining clarity and focus, making it one of the \u201clighter\u201d indicas on our list. It has been known to make consumers \u201ccrazy hungry,\u201d so make sure to have some noms on hand.\n Orange Skunk\nA citrus infusion with a clear-headed high, Orange Skunk relieves depression and anxiety in addition to a lack of appetite. With a myriad of effects, this strain can help relieve multiple symptoms, including inflammation, headaches, even pain and fibromyalgia.\n Gigabud\nThis indica-dominant hybrid is known to be expressly excellent for inducing an appetite, even among those with the most intense stomach symptoms. For those with nausea, weight loss, and issues with the digestive tract, Gigabud ought to be a staple for relief and to encourage a \u201cravenous\u201d appetite.\n Caramelo\nThis sativa-dominant hybrid has indica origins in the Lavender family, offering an uplifting buzz without paranoia, along with potent pain and nausea relief. While Caramelo is an energetic strain useful for daytime consumption, be forewarned: the effects may be short-lived, so you may require a stronger strain for longtime symptom management.\n Pure Kush\nTrue to its name, Pure Kush is one of the purest, most potent indicas you\u2019ll encounter. Watch out because this strain will knock you out like Mike Tyson if you\u2019re not careful. Place your pizza orders before you dose or you may have trouble peeling yourself up off the couch to even get to the kitchen, which just seems\u2026.so far away\u2026.\n Diablo\nContrary to its name, this devilish strain is a kinder, gentler indica than many on this list. While couchlock is still a potential side effect, Diablo will allow you the focus and mental capacity to tackle day-to-day life without too much trouble, although you may need to watch out for a case of the giggles.\nStill looking for an appetite stimulant?

Currently, there is one grower in Oregon who is providing this high CBD strain to a couple dispensaries. I'm trying to make sure he/she shares this cutting so the cannabis community doesn't lose it. Any strain with a combined cannabinoid content over 20% is good medicine. When you have a 3:2 ratio of CBD to THC that just sweetens the deal. Surprisingly potent for a strain with just 8% THC... that CBD is doing something good! Sample i got smelled mostly like regular weed with coffee undertones. \n*Note: currently, tests in OR list CBD, CBDa, CBG, & CBGa all as \"CBD\" and THC & THCa as \"THC\".
