    "description": "<p>Mazar x Blueberry is a well-rounded indica-dominant hybrid that helps patients knock out pain and relax into sleep after a long day. The sativa side of this strain allows for a nice head high as well, but it isn&rsquo;t overly hazy or unfocused. Mazar x Blueberry was created by Amsterdam&rsquo;s Dutch Passion Seeds to combine the sweet fruity aroma of <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry\">Blueberry</a> with the growing strengths of the hardy, high-yielding <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/indica/mazar-i-sharif\">Mazar</a>. Great for indoor growing, Mazar x Blueberry plants will stay shorter and bushy, flowering in 8 to 9 weeks. If you&rsquo;re looking for the California Mazar x Blueberry&nbsp;that has OG genetics, check out Mazar x Blueberry OG.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
