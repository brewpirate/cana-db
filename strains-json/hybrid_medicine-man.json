            "text": "This week is Crohn\u2019s Disease and Colitis Awareness week.\u00a0For those of you that don\u2019t know,\u00a0Crohn\u2019s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are gastrointestinal disorders in a group of conditions known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\nCrohn\u2019s Disease is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that\u00a0can affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the rectum, although it may skip certain areas of the intestine, leaving some healthy, while other parts suffer.\u00a0Ulcerative Colitis is a very similar disease in the IBD group of disorders, but it only affects the colon, affecting\u00a0only\u00a0the innermost lining of the colon.\u00a0\nThe telltale symptoms of Crohn\u2019s Disease:\n\nPersistent diarrhea\nRectal bleeding\nAbdominal pain and cramps\nConstipation\nUrgent need to move bowels\nSensation of incomplete evacuation or \u201crectal tenesmus\u201d (Hey, you learned a new word!)\n\nOther signs that are associated with IBD:\n\nFever\nLoss of appetite\nWeight loss\nFatigue\nNight sweats\nLoss of menstrual cycle in women\n\nSounds terrible, doesn\u2019t it?\u00a0These are painful,\u00a0life-altering disorders, which is why Crohn\u2019s Disease and Colitis are specified as qualifying conditions for medical cannabis in nearly half of all medical marijuana states.\nThese symptoms can be controlled somewhat through diet, but often cannabis offers some of the best relief for the most severe symptoms \u2013 cramps, nausea, loss of appetite, etc.\nWithout further ado, in honor of Crohn\u2019s Disease and Colitis Awareness Week, here are the top strains for your symptoms:\n\u00a01. Jean Guy\nA fan favorite from our neighbors to the North (Canada, eh?), Jean Guy (pronounced \u201cJawn Gee\u201d) is a sativa-dominant strain known for its high THC content and energizing effects.\u00a0A great one to start your day cramp-free.\n\u00a02. Hog's Breath\nHog\u2019s Breath is a well-known indica with roots in the Kush landrace and is known for its potency against heavy pain and anxiety \u2013 a good strain to relax after a long work day.\n\u00a03. Medicine Man\nMedicine Man lives up to its name by delivering potent pain relief with high levels of both THC and CBD.\u00a0This medicinal strain is closely related to the master of the indica jungle \u2013 White Rhino.\n\u00a04. Hash Plant\nHash Plant is known for an abundance of trichomes and a heavy body stone.\u00a0This indica has a reputation for blissful euphoria, as well as easing pain and inflammation associated with Crohn\u2019s and Colitis.\n\u00a05. Willie Nelson\nWillie Nelson is named for the Red-Headed Stranger himself. This sativa offers a clear-headed, energetic high known to incite creativity, as well as a decent case of the munchies.\u00a0\n\u00a06. Chemo\nChemo is just as sedative as you might imagine \u2013 a heavy body high that\u2019s perfect for chronic pain. Take note: the munchies are strong with this one.\u00a0If you have stomach cramps or trouble eating, this strain will inspire your appetite.\n\u00a07. Lemon Jack\nLemon Jack is born of the famed Jack Herer and Lemon Kush and offers strong psychoactive effects.\u00a0Lemon Jack is a daytime strain as strong as a cup of coffee, but without the harsh stomach irritation.\u00a0Recommended for users who suffer from fatigue.\n\u00a08. Golden Pineapple\nGolden Pineapple is as delightful as it sounds.\u00a0A hybrid cross that delivers uplifting, creative effects with a delicious fruity taste, it\u00a0offers relief from stress and anxiety without causing fatigue.\n\u00a09. Confidential Cheese\nConfidential Cheese is born of the legendary LA Confidential and Exodus Cheese. It offers powerful pain relief, as well as relief from insomnia.\u00a0Great for winding down before bedtime, Confidential Cheese also subdues painful muscle spasms and cramps.\n\u00a010. K2\nK2 is named for the world\u2019s second highest mountain peak, which makes sense, as it comes from two of the greats \u2013 White Widow and Hindu Kush.\u00a0K2 is known to increase appetite and calm nausea without any sedative sleepy effects, making it a great strain for both daytime and evening use.",

High is very evenly mixed head and body effects. A mild body buzz but no lethargy or laziness. Very euphoric and uplifted, with no paranoia or stress. Focused and alert, strong desire to listen to music or study. Mild but noticeable headband-like pressure around forehead, accompanied by a slightly tingly body buzz. Very manageable and enjoyable, perfect for reading or writing while listening to music. Definitely one of my favorites.",
