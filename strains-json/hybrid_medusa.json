The smoke itself is very smooth although after you exhale, the coughing is almost inevitable. You’ll start feeling the pressure build behind your nose and the couch-lock comes shortly after. Dam, my arm feels like wooden blocks right now. Now, my legs…I’m like that old man pirate dude with the wooden everything in Family Guy. I’ve noticed my breathing has gotten extremely slow. This is very calm, relaxing ganja; great for anxiety and relieving stress. I feel like I’m going to be passing out soon so I’ll try to do this as concisely as I can. Umm, taste is rather standard; didn’t notice any really obvious flavors that stuck out. Sorry to all the connoisseurs, no wow-factor here. The pre-smoke scent was somewhat mild with hints of sweet and sour scented leaves. The high isn’t overly stimulating like those found in many saliva’s; it is more…peaceful, serene.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1596398,"username":"wtfmonday","text":"Not my favorite strain ever, but still pretty good.
