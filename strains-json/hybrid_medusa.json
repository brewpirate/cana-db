You\u2019ll start feeling the pressure build behind your nose and the couch-lock comes shortly after. Dam, my arm feels like wooden blocks right now. Now, my legs\u2026I\u2019m like that old man pirate dude with the wooden everything in Family Guy. I\u2019ve noticed my breathing has gotten extremely slow. This is very calm, relaxing ganja; great for anxiety and relieving stress. I feel like I\u2019m going to be passing out soon so I\u2019ll try to do this as concisely as I can. Umm, taste is rather standard; didn\u2019t notice any really obvious flavors that stuck out. Sorry to all the connoisseurs, no wow-factor here. The pre-smoke scent was somewhat mild with hints of sweet and sour scented leaves. The high isn\u2019t overly stimulating like those found in many saliva\u2019s; it is more\u2026peaceful, serene.",
