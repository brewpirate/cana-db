            "text": "Got this at Old Toby in Chehalis, WA. See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog - AgingEnt.com --Brand: Honu\nStrain: Melon Gum\nSativa-dominant Hybrid--\nPotency Analysis: TTL 15.85% THC .14% CBD 0% THCA 17.91%\n--Packaging: 4.75\" x 3.25\" bright pink/purple plastic and mylar rip-top, zip-top bag --\nCost: $10/gram--\nThis is some really pretty marijuana.  The buds are all fluffy little balls.  This value priced, $10 gram came up at 1.1grams\n--\nThis Melon Gum has a sharp, very sweet candy-like smell.  It's really clean and delicious.\n--\nThe nuggets themselves have this gorgeous neon/crystal-white coloring and there are these bright orange hairs throughout every single nug and in between each and every nug structure.\n--\nThe smoke on this is as candy-sweet as it smells.  There's definitely an underlying sharp spiciness, like biting into a pink peppercorn while eating.  It just spreads throughout the smoke and provides a nice exhale flavor.  There's no real bite to it though, it's a unique flavor profile.\n--\nThis is definitely Sativa-dominant, fast-thought, advanced cerebral activity kind of pot, with an underlying body-high that is relaxing and calm.  I smoked this with a few different people, and some might note this is on the edge of being too Sativa, and could slide into an uncomfortable place. --\n\nThe moral of the story is - Puff these puffy poofs of pot, and if paranoia persists in your perception, please proceed with perspicacity.",

            "text": "Wow what a pleasant suprise is this weed!! Great smooth REAL melon flavour, as a flower and when smoked. Ideal for couchsurfing. Outstanding mix of every aspect good weed needs in my opinion; calming, relaxing, moodbooster, with a nice indica punch for the bodyrelaxation. I have to admit I'm not even a bit of a Bubblegum-fan, most of the time it has a bit of a sharp and dry, unpleasant smoke is my experience, and trust me I tried a few . This is the twist Bubbles needed, makes it way smoother and with a much nicer indica twist!!",
