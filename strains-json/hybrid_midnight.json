Finding the right strain to make our lives better. Like Midnight and Blue Dream. One gives me pain relief while the other helps me sleep!! My pain is such that I normally sleep 2-3 hours then the pain wakes me and I have to walk around to help alleviate my pain so I can try for another 2 or 3 hours. But, now it\u0027s one hit from \"Midnight\" and one from Blue Dream and I last maybe 15 minutes before I\u0027m off to dreamland.!\nAgain, thank God for SCIENCE !!! peace","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1616793,"username":"mcjanerson","text":"Gets me through everyday!

Discoveries made in the footsteps of Raphael Mechoulam (the internationally acclaimed researcher who first isolated THC) have brought new meaning to medical cannabis as strains are engineered to contain optimal levels of cannabinoids.\nHere are just a few strains from the Israeli cannabis supplier Tikun Olam that we recently added to the Leafly Explorer. Most of them are low- to moderate-THC and high-CBD, meaning they offer imperceptible psychoactive effects but strong medical relief from pain symptoms. One strain, however, is a balanced blend of low-to-moderate THC and CBD. Enjoy!\n1.
