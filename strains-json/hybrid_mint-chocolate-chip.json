You immediately get the felling this guy is strange. The more he talks you know he's a weirdo and that creepy felling crawls from the bottom of your spine up to your neck. (Women you know what I'm talking about)  This is the time to sprint back to your hotel room and smoke. Immediately your body is relaxed with all the creepy crawlies gone. Your mind starts to think happy thoughts.\n\nMCC makes your body and mood better no matter whats going on around you.",
