            "text": "Every region is different when it comes to strain availability. What might be easy to find on the West Coast might be almost impossible to come by on the other side of the country. Here, we take a look at the top 10 strains offered in Colorado dispensaries and shops.\nWhat do we mean by \u201ctop strains,\u201d you might ask? We gathered menu data from all of our Colorado locations and determined the 10 most commonly listed strains. These are closely aligned with the most frequently searched strains in Colorado, so store owners might want to take note when thinking about strain inventory.\n1. Blue Dream\n \nWhich major market isn\u2019t dominated by Blue Dream? With a widely recognized name, a fragrant berry aroma, and pleasantly uplifting effects, it comes as no surprise that this ubiquitous hybrid tops Colorado\u2019s inventory list.\n2. Durban Poison\n \nThe second most commonly offered strain in Colorado traveled far from its African homeland to share with us its lively effects. Stimulating euphoria feeds the mind creativity and focus, which goes to show why so many compare Durban Poison to a cup of coffee and use it as such.\n\n3. Sour Diesel\n \nAnother widely prolific sativa, Sour Diesel is by no means a rarity among Colorado shops and dispensaries. Its engaging cerebral energy is a perfect pair for getting outside and staying active, and in a state with so much outdoor recreation to enjoy, it makes sense that Sour Diesel has maintained its demand in Colorado.\n4. Golden Goat\n \nBorn and bred just over the border in Kansas, Golden Goat has retained its supremacy in Colorado since its westward arrival when medical marijuana was making its debut. While some in Colorado might grow weary of seeing Golden Goat at every corner, this fragrantly tropical sativa-dominant staple is must-try for visitors from outside the state.\n5. Flo\n \nThis uplifting hybrid keeps a steady flow into stash jars all over Colorado. With a sweet and earthy flavor telling of its Afghani ancestry, Flo provides an all-over blast of euphoria that relaxes the body while letting the mind run free.\n\n6. GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\n \nThe Cookie craze may have started in California, but it certainly didn\u2019t end there. Colorado natives were quick to embrace the potent GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), making it the sixth most stocked strain in the state. For those who have experienced this hybrid\u2019s heavy-handed euphoria, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine why this strain is an absolute necessity for Colorado dispensaries and shops.\n7. Mob Boss\n \nThough relatively new to the scene, Mob Boss rapidly stole hearts in Colorado with its flowery citrus flavor and relentless potency. For those of you treating pain, appetite loss, and stress, you won\u2019t need much of the Mob Boss to get the job done. A little goes a long way with this resin-storm of a hybrid.\n8. Northern Lights\n \nFew indicas and indica-dominant hybrids made it on this list, but of course the exception would be Northern Lights. This heavy indica brings out appreciation from all the senses: food, nature, company, hobbies\u2026what isn\u2019t made better by the dreamy, sublime sensations of Northern Lights?\n\n9. Green Crack\n \nIts name may be unsavory to some, but that hasn\u2019t kept this strain from flying off the shelves of storefronts across Colorado. Green Crack has an uncanny ability of bringing laughing fits to social circles and engaged focus to solo ventures.\n10. Banana Kush\n \nLast but not least, Banana Kush takes the tail end of our list as the 10th most commonly stocked strain in Colorado cannabis shops. Carrying the unmistakable aroma of fresh bananas, this potent hybrid strain is all you\u2019ll need to command the mind and body into deep relaxation.",
