            "text": "Originating in the 1960s, funk music was brought earthside by black American musicians who mixed rhythm, blues, soul, and jazz to give birth to a new genre of music that is as groovy as it is dance-inducing. Placing heavy emphasis on bass and drums, funk music is a distinctive genre that gets its name from the early etymology of the word, meaning \u201cmusty,\u201d or \u201cearthy.\u201d Anyone who has watched a funk bassist get down knows the \u201cstank face\u201d all too well\u2014it\u2019s this pure, earth-driven vibe that gave funk its name and magnetic presence in the early scene.\n\nThere is truly no other genre like funk\u2014a genre that can enliven, inspire, rejuvenate, and energize. It is a sound that is both euphoric and\u00a0grounded. The following is a list of some suggested funk albums to get the bones shaking and heart pumping, best enjoyed with some happy, sativa-dominant strains. Have your own funk albums you love to listen to while high? Tell us\u00a0all about them\u00a0in the comments below!\nMothership Connection by Parliament-Funkadelic\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Funfetti\n\u201cFunk not only moves, it can remove,\u201d go the intro lyrics in this delightfully stanky, purely funky iconic album by Parliament-Funkadelic. Led by singer-songwriter George Clinton, whose fresh sound sparked its own genre title known as \u201cP-funk,\u201d Parliament-Funkadelic\u2019s vibe\u00a0is quintessentially funk, and thus impossible not to groove to. Mothership Connection is an album that plays out\u00a0like a performance: It begins with a lively introduction, like the opening act to a play, and then dives deep into a medley of groovy bass lines and Clinton\u2019s seamless vocals. Mothership Connection is a collection of pure funk sound that will have the listener looking up, getting up, and feeling up\u2014particularly in conjunction with the lively strain Funfetti.\nFugue State by Vulfpeck\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Monkey Paw\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Vulfpeck yet, get ready to join the vulfpack. The American funk group with an imaginary German flair have been steadily taking the music scene by storm since they were founded in 2011. Fugue State, released in 2014, is one of their most popular albums despite containing only six songs and lasting about 18 minutes. While mostly instrumental, Vulfpeck does at times feature vocals such as those on the track \u201c1612,\u201d a thoroughly catchy offering.\nDespite its short playlist, Fugue State is not lacking in sound or diversity; and perhaps diversity of sound is what Vulfpeck does best. Each song, even each album, builds\u00a0a distinctive vibe that somehow manages to be both modern and original while also maintaining\u00a0a nostalgic and vintage je ne sais quoi.\nBeyond The Sun by Orgone\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lemon Bubble\nOrgone\u2019s Beyond The Sun is a venerable pleasure from the first note to the last. The music is playful, fierce, and lively, with the powerful vocals of singer Fanny Franklin driving the sound like any of the best conductors. Although much of their music is instrumental, Beyond The Sun especially highlights Franklin\u2019s impeccable tone. However, make no mistake\u2014as riveting as Franklin\u2019s voice may be, instrumentalists are not outmatched but rather perfectly paired, creating a delicious confection of funk for the cannabis-elevated ears to enjoy. This is an album that will delight and invigorate while encouraging participation through song and dance.\n\nNext by Soulive\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: The Sauce\nOriginating in the forever famous Woodstock, NY, Soulive is a jazz-funk trio that brings the sounds of soul, R&B, rock, and jazz to their largely instrumental recordings. Soulive is certainly a jazzier take on funk, with Eric Krasno on guitar, Alan Evans on drums and Neal Evans on keys, organ, and clarinet. At times, it\u2019s easy to forget Soulive is a trio with their sound so rich and full. Their album\u00a0Next, released in 2002, adds saxophonist Sam Kininger to the mix, providing an extra depth to their already wildly intricate sound. The album invites the herbally enraptured\u00a0listener to go on a smooth ride through funky highs and soulful lows, which wind together a sprinkle of vocals amongst a sea of invigorating instrumentals.\nRowdy Duty by Deep Banana Blackout\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Banana Diesel \u00a0\nPunchy and powerful, Deep Banana Blackout\u2019s live album Rowdy Duty transports the listener to a live funk show filled with delightful improvisation, stimulating instrumentals, and robust vocals. Recorded in a single night, the 13-track album truly encapsulates the band\u2019s jazz-funk, New Orleans-style sound. The eight-piece ensemble includes a full horn section, creating a funk experience that is truly dynamic and full. All together, it\u2019s\u00a0an energetic funk soundscape that will lead the blissed-out\u00a0listener through a maze of\u00a0funky highs and spacey lows.\n\nFunk music is a music of joy that moves people physically as well as uplifting them mentally. It is perhaps one of the most distinctive genres and one of the most original to come out of the golden era of music in the 1960s. Funk enlivens, and listening to it is simply good for the soul. At the end of the day, funk is all about happiness.",

            "text": "We're rolling into 2015 with five new strains nominated by you using the Leafly app! If you had a jarring, eventful transition into the new year, these\u00a0hybrids are just what you'll need to recover balanced equilibrium. Or, for those who had a relaxing night in, one of these new varieties should be all you need to stay on track for a blissful, stress-free 2015 launch.\nWe know many of you are no stranger to these new strains, so be sure to leave a review sharing your thoughts if you've had a chance to try one already!\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a01. White Nightmare\nCharacteristics of White Nightmare:\n\nBlue Dream\u2019s soaring\u00a0sativa\u00a0effects and\u00a0fruity\u00a0flavors collide with White Moonshine\u2019s resinous coat of milky\u00a0trichomes\u00a0to produce White Nightmare. The sativa-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0brings a forceful,\u00a0sweet\u00a0aroma of\u00a0berries\u00a0and\u00a0Haze. The flavor stays true to its Blue Dream genetics but with an\u00a0earthy, hash-like aftertaste. White Nightmare generates a stimulating stream of\u00a0euphoria\u00a0and bliss that\u00a0elevates the mood\u00a0and brings with it a comfortable,\u00a0relaxing\u00a0body high.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a02. Monkey Paw\nCharacteristics of Monkey Paw:\n\nMonkey Paw takes its name from its fingerling buds that resemble the curled paws of primates. It is a fabled old school strain whose roots sprouted in Michigan and has built a solid reputation for itself across the Midwest. This\u00a0hybrid\u00a0is a compelling mixture of\u00a0Acapulco Gold\u00a0and\u00a0Colombian Gold\u00a0sativas\u00a0that are balanced by\u00a0Afghani\u2019s\u00a0indica\u00a0influence to produce a\u00a0pungent\u00a0combination of\u00a0sweet\u00a0and\u00a0fruity\u00a0flavors. Its aroma is reminiscent of the thick musk of\u00a0Skunk\u00a0varieties with sharp notes of zesty\u00a0citrus\u00a0that cut the senses. The aftertaste of fresh fruits, like\u00a0grape\u00a0and\u00a0blueberry, serves as precursor to the\u00a0relaxing\u00a0effects that calm body\u00a0pains\u00a0and\u00a0stimulate the stomach.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a03. Lost Coast OG\nCharacteristics of Lost Coast OG:\n\nLost Coast OG is a 60/40 indica-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that marries\u00a0Chemdawg 4\u00a0genetics with those of two age-old\u00a0heirloom strains, Pakistani Kush and\u00a0Lemon Thai. Flavors of sour\u00a0citrus\u00a0and\u00a0earthy\u00a0musk burst through on the exhale in show of its signature OG\u00a0terpene\u00a0profile. This California native induces a soaring cerebral buzzing sensation that brings new vitality to\u00a0mood,\u00a0creativity, and\u00a0conversation. The potently euphoric effects can sometimes skid into anxiety with large doses, so novices should approach this OG with some degree of caution.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a04. Crazy Miss Hyde\nCharacteristics of Crazy Miss Hyde:\n\nCrazy Miss Hyde is a surprisingly balanced\u00a0hybrid\u00a0given her name. She is a lively combination of the\u00a0uplifting,\u00a0sativa-dominant\u00a0Belladona\u00a0and the powerhouse\u00a0indica\u00a0Northern Lights. The buds deliver a potent mixture of\u00a0earthy\u00a0flavors like\u00a0menthol\u00a0and chocolate with a\u00a0sweet\u00a0vanilla\u00a0influence. The effects tend to be focused in the head, with thought provoking stimulation and\u00a0creativity\u00a0that can border on\u00a0anxiety\u00a0when over-consumed. With the right dosing, the indica influence levels out the effects of Crazy Miss Hyde and induces a\u00a0relaxing\u00a0sense of\u00a0euphoria.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a05. Blueberry Yum Yum\nCharacteristics of Blueberry Yum Yum:\n\nBlueberry Yum Yum is a\u00a0hybrid\u00a0strain whose popularity was ushered in by rap artist Ludacris and his song centered on the strain. While certainly the progeny of the famed\u00a0Blueberry\u00a0indica, its other parent is suspected to have been a\u00a0Durban Poison\u00a0sativa. Because of its parents\u2019 polarity, Blueberry Yum Yum can express a wide spectrum of effects, but consumers typically report\u00a0uplifting,\u00a0happy\u00a0effects perfect for any time of the day. Though dominated by an unmistakable\u00a0blueberry\u00a0aroma, accents of\u00a0earthy\u00a0mint\u00a0and\u00a0pine\u00a0can also be detected on the palate.\u00a0",
