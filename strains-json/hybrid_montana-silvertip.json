When vaped you are hit with an incredible grape flavor, like purple gatorade! The flowers are dense and caked in trichromes. A very blanced hybrid. You can feel both the parent genetics clearly and they seem to work harmoniously. You get the head high from the ssh and the body high from the gdp. The effects also last a VERY long time... 2 to 3 hours ",

Dark purple buds dipped in big white shiny trichomes looking frosted in sugar, smelled of berries, super duper sedative Indica phenotype. Smoke very little and it was the ice box and some shut eye whether you wanted to sleep or not..... Narcolepsy cannabis furthermore I was put into a gleeful pain free state on the way to slumber... The True Silver Tip is a knockout Indica! Purple and tasty-FRUIT LOOPS with no disorientation, just glee! I should have bought all I could not afford! It was a clone only strain, when Montana flopped on their Medical program(happened in Switzerland too) growers were made criminals overnight, furthermore the real Silvertip was in jeopardy of being lost as grows were being shutdown and raided throughout Montana. Where the real Silvertip relocated to I would love to know and a cutting as well! aloha",
