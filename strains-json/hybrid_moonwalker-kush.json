The latent indica parentage consists of Chem’s Sister and Sour Dubble, and shows up as a warm airy sensation in the body, making this strain ideal for pain management. Ridge Berry\u0027s crystalline buds smell of pine, berry, and a touch of fuel.\n\n \n  7. Trash\n\nTrash is an indica-dominant hybrid that is anything but garbage. This strain crosses Purple Trainwreck against Afghani Hash Plant, blending the mental alertness of Trainwreck with the resin production and deep, earthy aroma native to Afghani genetics. Trash is an ideal smoke for long bouts of video games or other stationary activities. These effects also lend themselves to patients suffering from chronic pain and nausea.\n\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12002045/new-strains-alert-dawgfather-og-bloodhound-moonwalker-kush-and-mo.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-dawgfather-og-bloodhound-moonwalker-kush-and-mo"}],"reviewCount":15,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":23.809523809523807},{"name":"Pine","score":19.047619047619044},{"name":"Mint","score":17.857142857142854},{"name":"Skunk","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Pungent","score":1.1904761904761905}],"effects":[{"name":"Focused","score":20.238095238095234},{"name":"Sleepy","score":17.857142857142854},{"name":"Aroused","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Relaxed","score":9.5238095238095237},{"name":"Euphoric","score":8.3333333333333321}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":19.047619047619044},{"name":"Stress","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Depression","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Insomnia","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Nausea","score":2.3809523809523809}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"PTSD","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Anorexia","score":1.1904761904761905},{"name":"Migraines","score":1.1904761904761905}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":17.857142857142854},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.1904761904761905}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/moonwalker-kush_100x100_7739.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522566/b/moonwalker-kush__primary_b7d2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/moonwalker-kush_100x100_9c5d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/518161/b/moonwalker-kush__primary_06be.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Bellevue, WA","Bellingham, WA","Bremerton, WA","Buckley, WA","Edmonds, WA","Everett, WA","Issaquah, WA","Puyallup, WA","Spokane Valley, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/moonwalker-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.86666666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

This strain packs a wallop and is recommended for nighttime use only.\n\n \n  5. Moonwalker Kush\n\nMoonwalker Kush is a balanced indica-dominant hybrid that is the genetic cross of Triple OG and Tahoe Alien. This odoriferous combination speaks volumes through its scent, which is thick with soured earth and a hint of pepper on the finish. The herbaceous terpene profile aligns nicely with this strain’s intense relaxation and moderate cerebral effects. Try Moonwalker Kush after dark to harness the sedative effects nestled below layers of trichomes and brown pistils.\n\n \n  6. Ridge Berry\n\nRidge Berry by Marley Natural is a succulent and stimulating sativa-dominant strain that imbues the consumer with energy right away, but leans back into alert sedation over time. The latent indica parentage consists of Chem’s Sister and Sour Dubble, and shows up as a warm airy sensation in the body, making this strain ideal for pain management. Ridge Berry\u0027s crystalline buds smell of pine, berry, and a touch of fuel.\n\n \n  7. Trash\n\nTrash is an indica-dominant hybrid that is anything but garbage. This strain crosses Purple Trainwreck against Afghani Hash Plant, blending the mental alertness of Trainwreck with the resin production and deep, earthy aroma native to Afghani genetics. Trash is an ideal smoke for long bouts of video games or other stationary activities. These effects also lend themselves to patients suffering from chronic pain and nausea.\n\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12002045/new-strains-alert-dawgfather-og-bloodhound-moonwalker-kush-and-mo.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-dawgfather-og-bloodhound-moonwalker-kush-and-mo"}],"reviewCount":15,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":23.809523809523807},{"name":"Pine","score":19.047619047619044},{"name":"Mint","score":17.857142857142854},{"name":"Skunk","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Pungent","score":1.1904761904761905}],"effects":[{"name":"Focused","score":20.238095238095234},{"name":"Sleepy","score":17.857142857142854},{"name":"Aroused","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Relaxed","score":9.5238095238095237},{"name":"Euphoric","score":8.3333333333333321}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":19.047619047619044},{"name":"Stress","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Depression","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Insomnia","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Nausea","score":2.3809523809523809}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"PTSD","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Anorexia","score":1.1904761904761905},{"name":"Migraines","score":1.1904761904761905}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":17.857142857142854},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.1904761904761905}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/moonwalker-kush_100x100_7739.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522566/b/moonwalker-kush__primary_b7d2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/moonwalker-kush_100x100_9c5d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/518161/b/moonwalker-kush__primary_06be.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Bellevue, WA","Bellingham, WA","Bremerton, WA","Buckley, WA","Edmonds, WA","Everett, WA","Issaquah, WA","Puyallup, WA","Spokane Valley, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/moonwalker-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.86666666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
