            "text": "This week\u2019s New Strains Alert is for all my dawgs\u00a0running wild all over the world. This\u00a0pack of feral beasts trots the Chemdawg continuum and marks its territory with the chemical essence the genetic parentage is known for. We've also added Trash, Moonwalker Kush, and Ridge Berry to give these hounds a few\u00a0activities to get into. Round up your dawgs and spark up \u2014 these strains are howlers!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a01. Dawgfather OG\n\nDawgfather OG, or simply \u201cThe Dawgfather,\u201d is an indica-dominant hybrid created by AlphaKronik Genes capable of massive plant production and a healthier-than-average yield. With potency floating above 20%, this strain contends well with chronic pain, insomnia, Crohn's, and anxiety. Expect traditional notes of gas/chemicals, Kush, and some funkiness. Dawgfather OG offers a strong buzz with nuance worth exploring.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a02. Bloodhound\n\nBloodhound is the obscure cross of Huckleberry Hound and Guard Dawg (by RedEyed Genetics). This genetic coupling was motivated by the desire to preserve the beautiful foliage and tartness of Huckleberry Hound while co-opting Guard Dawg\u2019s potency. With a decent yield and THC percentage upwards of 24%, this strain smells of tart fruit intermixed with an earthy chocolate fondue flavor.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a03. Huckleberry Hound\n\nHuckleberry Hound is an obscure hybrid that has alleged roots in Blueberry and Chemdawg families. With notes of berry intermixed with a palatable melange of chemicals, this flower's bouquet is challenging but worthwhile. Expect airy body effects that take on more weight with time and cerebral effects that remind many of a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-diesel\" >Sour Diesel\u2019s type of mental stimuli. Most Chemdawg lineage is potent, so be aware, as this strain is a howler.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a04. Guard Dawg\n\nGuard Dawg is an indica-dominant phenotype bred by RedEyed Genetics. This flower\u2019s genetic parentage is a combination of Abusive OG and TreStardawg. The plant smells of its OG heritage with overtones of caramel and coffee bean. But watch out! This strain packs a wallop and is recommended for nighttime use only.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a05. Moonwalker Kush\n\nMoonwalker Kush is a balanced indica-dominant hybrid that is the genetic cross of Triple OG and Tahoe Alien. This odoriferous combination speaks volumes through its scent, which is thick with soured earth and a hint of pepper on the finish. The herbaceous terpene profile aligns nicely with this strain\u2019s intense relaxation and moderate cerebral effects. Try Moonwalker Kush after dark to harness the sedative effects nestled below layers of trichomes and brown pistils.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a06. Ridge Berry\n\nRidge Berry by Marley Natural is a succulent and stimulating sativa-dominant strain that imbues the consumer with energy right away, but leans back into alert sedation over time. The latent indica parentage consists of Chem\u2019s Sister and Sour Dubble, and shows up as a warm airy sensation in the body, making this strain ideal for pain management. Ridge Berry's crystalline buds smell of pine, berry, and a touch of fuel.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a07. Trash\n\nTrash is an indica-dominant hybrid that is anything but garbage. This strain crosses Purple Trainwreck against Afghani Hash Plant, blending the mental alertness of Trainwreck with the resin production and deep, earthy aroma native to Afghani genetics. Trash is an ideal smoke for long bouts of video games or other stationary activities. These effects also lend themselves to patients suffering from chronic pain and nausea.\n\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",

            "text": "They did IT! The crazy bastards did IT! 32%! What the hell were you thinking -- THIRTY-TWO percent? Was there a day when the growers of this Godzilla weed were saying, \"Shit, I wanna be REALLY high, but I'm all outta dabs!\"? Because I have a lot of theories as to how one decides that 32% THC in buddage form was even remotely a sane idea. Now most of these ideas of mine are total garbage, so you might have to supply your own, but the main idea here is ain't nobody done need no 32% THC weed! OR DO THEY? Because once you've taken this shit out for a drive on the one-hit test, your perceptions of what it means to be REAL fuckin' high are going to change. Couch-lock? I've got pinstripes on my ass from sitting on this corduroy couch for so long. In fact, I'm so high right now that I hallucinated we elected an angry midget the color of a bowl of Cheetos for President. Oh, fuck, we did? I sure am glad I have a sack of THIRTY-FUCKING-TWO PERCENT weed right now! Seriously, 'tho, how the hell am I gonna make this eighth last four years?",
