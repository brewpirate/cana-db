This \"Morning Star\" strain is definitely in my top 5. I tried it based on reviews from this site, and was not disappointed. The color is deep, almost looks outdoor grown. The buds I got initially taste a little dirty, but still sharp and skunky. The one thing I don\u0027t like about it is you really need a nice indica for the night time lest you have some slight trouble falling asleep. It makes the mind race with creative thoughts, and motivates you to do something about it (i.e. This review).  Also, I can see smoking too much of this strain beginning to affect my anxiety disorder negatively.  Overall, I give it a good word.
