            "text": "Ever since I obtained my MMJ card, I have been on a constant search for the perfect strain for anxiety, as well as one that will let me be energetic and get things done. This \"Morning Star\" strain is definitely in my top 5. I tried it based on reviews from this site, and was not disappointed. The color is deep, almost looks outdoor grown. The buds I got initially taste a little dirty, but still sharp and skunky. The one thing I don't like about it is you really need a nice indica for the night time lest you have some slight trouble falling asleep. It makes the mind race with creative thoughts, and motivates you to do something about it (i.e. This review).  Also, I can see smoking too much of this strain beginning to affect my anxiety disorder negatively.  Overall, I give it a good word. Thanks for reading!",

It has this skunky citrusy orange smell with earthy berry undertones. This strain delivers a mostly sativa like high that really gets your brain going. Makes you feel uplifted, motivated and energetic with a chill euphoric feeling. Would recommend for a wake and bake or during the day time",
