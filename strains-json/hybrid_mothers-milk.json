Vail, Colorado \n\nFirst off, don\u0027t let the name scare you away.  If you do you\u0027re only missing out.  This strain doesn\u0027t scream milk to me.  It is sweet, earthy, and unique.  As far as effects go I completely disagree with Leafly\u0027s description of this strain.  The version I got at least was very indica dominant, 70/30 or so.  The first twenty minutes I fought to stay awake while my whole body went into instant relaxation/couch lock.  After that calmed I was left with a light euphoria.  All in all great strain for hanging out after a long days work.  9/10","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"},{"id":1631868,"username":"rsgibson","text":"Very calming for me and good body relaxation.
