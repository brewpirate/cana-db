This strain doesn't scream milk to me.  It is sweet, earthy, and unique.  As far as effects go I completely disagree with Leafly's description of this strain.  The version I got at least was very indica dominant, 70/30 or so.  The first twenty minutes I fought to stay awake while my whole body went into instant relaxation/couch lock.  After that calmed I was left with a light euphoria.  All in all great strain for hanging out after a long days work.  9/10",
