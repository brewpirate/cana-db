This cross of Willy\u0026rsquo;s Wonder, Granddaddy Purple, and White Widow is an uplifting strain that comes with insatiable appetite stimulation. Mountain Girl\u0026rsquo;s aroma is sweet and earthy with a skunky finish. This strain is good for improving mood and front-loading creativity, but mind your dosage, as the intense euphoria can be overwhelming for uninitiated consumers.\n","aka":null,"rating":4.4,"highlightedReviews":[{"id":1441326,"username":"Sue_Perlative","text":"While I wouldn\u0027t call this strain mind-blowing, what it does do for you is really great. Mountain Girl is the ultimate for simple, noodling activities. So....baking, or cleaning, coloring, knitting, etc. I love to have this around the house for when I need to do some spring cleaning, or I just want to laundry, and find yourself singing while you get some stuff done that is normally so mundane you can\u0027t handle it.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1628322,"username":"MedicalBlaze","text":"Great for gardeningüçÉüåù The 8% CBD helped with the pain üåª","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/nlScf73DprAwIkv-F-GJ4H0b_tk=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2fleafly-images%2fuser-profile%2fNKEbcOR9S6K3yP3e5RFs_50A8AF34-73A3-4ABD-80F1-0CEBD5CFB885.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":5,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":71.428571428571431},{"name":"Pungent","score":50},{"name":"Sage","score":14.285714285714285},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":7.1428571428571423},{"name":"Sweet","score":7.1428571428571423}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":64.285714285714278},{"name":"Creative","score":57.142857142857139},{"name":"Happy","score":28.571428571428569},{"name":"Uplifted","score":21.428571428571427},{"name":"Euphoric","score":14.285714285714285}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":57.142857142857139},{"name":"Inflammation","score":50},{"name":"Depression","score":14.285714285714285},{"name":"Stress","score":14.285714285714285},{"name":"Fatigue","score":7.1428571428571423}],"conditions":[{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":50},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":7.1428571428571423},{"name":"Anxiety","score":7.1428571428571423},{"name":"Asthma","score":7.1428571428571423},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":7.1428571428571423}],"negatives":[],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mountain-girl_100x100_b9a3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1005376/b/mountain-girl__primary_7c36.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Bend, OR","Damascus, OR","Hoquiam, WA","Pendleton, OR","Rainier, OR","Salem, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/mountain-girl","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.4/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Willy\u0027s Wonder","subtitle":null,"slug":"willys-wonder","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/willys-wonder","symbol":"Wil","applink":"leafly://strain/willys-wonder"},{"name":"Granddaddy Purple","subtitle":null,"slug":"granddaddy-purple","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/granddaddy-purple","symbol":"Gdp","applink":"leafly://strain/granddaddy-purple"},{"name":"White Widow","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-widow","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow","symbol":"Ww","applink":"leafly://strain/white-widow"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
