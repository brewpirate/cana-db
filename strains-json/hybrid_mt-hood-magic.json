            "text": "Summer 2017\u2019s total solar eclipse is America\u2019s celestial event of the century. The first eclipse to fully cross the contiguous United States since 1918, it will mobilize millions of travelers on (and to) the North American continent. Happily, the eclipse has decided to include a rec-legal state in its path of totality.\nAs many as a million visitors are expected in Oregon alone on August 21st, and a good many of them will be marveling at the solar phenomenon in an elevated state of mind. The following are three strains and three products we recommend for viewing the event, as well as three pieces of advice for getting high while the world goes dark.\n\nBest Cannabis Strains for Viewing the Eclipse\nSunset Sherbet \nThe name alone brings this one to mind right away, but its effervescent cerebral effects and feel-good full body high are what make this strain a perfect eclipse-viewing pick. The indica-leaning hybrid is potent but won\u2019t put you under, and offers a jolt of imaginative energy that will have you in awe over everything going on up above.\nMt. Hood Magic\nAn Oregon-born hybrid cross between Durban Poison and Northern Lights #5, Mt. Hood Magic can be found in Portland, Seaside, and Bend, and begets a bubbly, euphoric, social high and a delectable dose of citrusy flavor. If you want to get extra-local, this is your pick\u2014just be sure to check whether the dispensary you\u2019re hitting will have it, as it\u2019s rarer than either Sunset Sherbet or Super Silver Haze.\nSuper Silver Haze\nThis earthy sativa is the perfect way to fully appreciate the natural beauty of the eclipse\u2014as a Haze, it\u2019ll leave you feeling happy yet relaxed and fully at peace with the world around you. Where Mt. Hood Magic can be tricky to track down, Super Silver Haze products and pre-rolls are everywhere, so you can definitely find this strain no matter where you end up watching the event.\n\nBest Cannabis Products for the Eclipse\nD!PPER by Dipstick Vapes\nYou\u2019ll be camped out ready to watch the eclipse for awhile (it starts coming on around 9:00 a.m. and reaches totality right about 10:20), so you\u2019ll want something portable with a solid battery life. This concentrate vape is the way to go: It includes a unique Vapor Tip Atomizer attachment for actual dabs, or a Quartz Crystal Atomizer that can be loaded in a more traditional manner. Remember to clean it out thoroughly if you\u2019ll be flying home\u2014no transporting cannabis across state lines.\nWana Jewels\nThere\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be near a ton of people while you\u2019re watching, so be considerate with smoke, vapor, and smells, particularly if you\u2019re around families. Edibles are the most discreet way to do it. We recommend low-dose edibles so you can slowly tailor your high to the perfect level as the eclipse comes on. Wana Jewels are delicious and ideal for this kind of dosing, as they contain less than 2mg per candy.\nMary\u2019s Medicinals Transdermal Gel Pen\nThis purchase is an investment in comfort\u2014you\u2019re going to be craning your neck for hours watching the sun. A transdermal topical is the perfect thing to have on hand: Rub it between your wrists for a subtle mental buzz, or massage a few pumps into your neck for localized relief and minimal psychoactive effects.\n\nAdvice for Watching the Eclipse While High\nBe wary of dry eyes.\nSmoking or vaping in particular can cause them, which won\u2019t make for an enjoyable viewing experience. Solution: Stay hydrated, bring eye drops, and if you want to be extra-careful, close your eyes when you exhale a lungful of smoke or vapor. And speaking of eyes, don\u2019t forget your shades\u2014meaning eclipse viewing glasses, which you\u2019ll need to safely look at the sky (no, regular sunglasses won\u2019t work).\nPack a survival kit.\nInclude munchies, water, eye drops, sunscreen, an extra lighter, those eclipse viewing glasses, a camera or your phone, a blanket, a pillow\u2014and don\u2019t forget your cannabis. It\u2019s far better to be over-prepared than under-prepared. Speaking of preparedness, set multiple alarms on the morning of the eclipse, and stake out your preferred viewing location in advance.\nMake a trip of it.\nWant to spend more than a day in Oregon? Good plan, because trying to arrive at a viewing location anywhere close to Monday morning is going to be your worst nightmare in terms of traffic (we\u2019re talking standstills, not a crawl). What to do: Check out our complete Oregon cannabis road trip itinerary, which zig-zags between the state\u2019s cannabis hubs before ending up in the path of totality in time for the eclipse. That way, if untimely clouds ruin your viewing plans, you\u2019ll still have had a fantastic time in this beautiful state.",

Use the advanced search filters at the top of our strain Explorer to \"customize\" your 4/20 experience! Or, allow us to recommend the following seven strains that were just added to our database. Who knows, maybe they're just what you're looking for.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a01. Kid N' Cookies\n\nA cross of GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) (Forum cut) and Snowman OG, Kid n\u2019 Cookies is a collaboration between Fresno, CA breeders Loud Seeds, and Christopher \u201cKid\u201d Reid, better known as one half of the famous \u201890s rap duo \u201cKid n\u2019 Play.\u201d As a potent indica-dominant hybrid testing at over 22% THC, Kid n\u2019 Cookies has a heavy, sedating high that can provide relief from pain, nausea, migraines, and insomnia. The flavor is much like the \u201ccookie\u201d taste of GSC with undertones of pine.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a02. Tigermelon\n\nTigermelon is a mysterious strain of unknown origin that has been used by the breeder Bodhi Seeds to create some spectacular hybrids such as Snow Leopard. It is thought to be a three-way cross of Chemdawg, Apollo 11 (Genius cut) and an Uzbekistani indica, and the smell has been described by Bodhi as \u201csandalwood mango lassi.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a03. Logic Diesel\n\nCreated by GroundSwell Cannabis Boutique in Denver, CO at the request of world-renowned electronic/acid jazz musician DJ Logic, Logic Diesel is a cross between Mystic Kush and NYC Diesel. It has a sweet and sour, skunky diesel odor and flavors ranging from sweet sandalwood to spicy fuel. Logic Diesel will provide an intense, exciting sense of euphoria along with a mildly relaxing body high that is perfect for hitting the dance floor.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a04. Haze Berry\n\nA cross between Super Silver Haze and DJ Short\u2019s famous Blueberry, Haze Berry is an 80% sativa hybrid that has become quite popular for its combination of sweet berry, indica-like flavors, and sativa highs. As you might expect from a plant with two extremely potent parents, Haze Berry routinely tests at well over 20% THC, and some cultivars have a significant amount of CBD as well. In addition, it provides higher than average yields and a relatively short flowering time of 9-10 weeks, making this a very attractive strain for sativa enthusiasts. Haze Berry gives the consumer a euphoric, creativity-inducing high that gradually gives way to a profound sensation of relaxation and well-being.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a05. Mt. Hood Magic\n\nThought to be exclusive to Portland, Oregon dispensary Five Zero Trees, Mt. Hood Magic is a cross between Northern Lights #5 and Durban Poison. There a few different phenotypes available: two are indica-dominant and more resemble the NL5 portion of its genetics, testing at 17% and 14% THC; and one is sativa-dominant and similar to Durban Poison, testing at 19% THC.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a06. Citrus Sap\n\nFrom Crockett Family Farms and DNA Genetics, Citrus Sap is a hybrid cross between GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4) and Tangie. Growers can expect high yields, heavy resin production, and a sweet mandarin orange aroma, as well as a high calyx-to-leaf ratio. Its flowering time averages between 65 to 70 days.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a07. Skins Skunk\n\nThis 60% indica-dominant hybrid from Loud Seeds is a result of years of work that started by pollinating an elite clone-only Afgoo found in Sonoma with a male Michigan Skunk. Selected and bred to the f4 generation, Skins Skunk produces generous yields of hashy smelling flowers with THC levels ranging from 17% to 21% and CBD levels up to 2%.\n\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",

It will be found all over soon. It may not my favorite cannabis smell but it is flat out delicious and as soon as I get a whiff of it, I have flashbacks to the medicinal sides of this strain.\nLook: Dense light green nugs with near whitish orange hairs. Machine trimmed.\nTaste: The unexplainable Durban comes through in the beginning and the earthy part of the NL#5 that I love is fully present. A wonderful taste. Actually stronger tasting than it smelled. If within, near or you find a true representation of this fine plant, seek it out!!\nRecommendation for medicine: Organize your house. Clean the place. Get to work! Really uplifting and a go getter for me. I really enjoy this strain and will be seeking out more of it for daytime use again soon!",
