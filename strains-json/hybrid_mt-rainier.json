It\u0027s definitely Indica Dominant and you will feel that immediately. When it hits me I immediately feel the tensions and stress I dealt with throughout the day disappear and muscles loosen up as my body and mind wind down. One of the things I appreciate most about this rain is that I\u0027m still able to function while on it. It is a very good strain, can be found at a really good price, taste and hits very smooth and is worth every single penny.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"},{"id":1568595,"username":"1800potdoctor","text":"I just recently tried this strain for the first time today. Mt. Rainier is great for daytime use, or a \"wake and bake.\" I smoked one bowl of this strain at 8:50 am and got so high that I didn\u0027t come down until 12:30 pm. It\u0027s an amazing hybrid, just enough Indica to give you a powerful body high in the beginning, and not make you too tired. I came home and started to write a part of my sociology essay that is due in 9 days. And after reviewing it, it was clear that the paragraph I rewrote was so much better than the original questioned paragraph about how sociology is like/unlike hard science. The creativeness and focus this strain gave me was amazing. Mt. Rainier is a great strain to smoke when you have things to do, like feed four horses in the morning (I do that every morning) and write a new part of your sociology paper. 5 DAYS LATER. I woke up today (the day of my math 120 college test) and smoked one bowl of Mt. Rainier around 7:30 am and took my math 120 test at 10:30 am, I was still a little high and I took my time, and answered every question except for three which I did not know, and reviewed my answers before submitting. And I got a really good score, 85%! This is an unforgettable strain for a wake and bake.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3325","title":"New Strains Alert: Kraken, Harry Potter, Incredible Hulk, Mt.
