            "text": "Leafly's Explorer was just updated with some new strains! Is Harry Potter as magical as it sounds? Have you released the Kraken yet? And is Mt. Rainier as epic as the volcano it's named after? If you've tried any of these, be sure to share your experiences with them in a strain review. Click the strain's name or tile to navigate to their description page where you can browse and leave reviews.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Harry Potter\n\nHarry Potter is an otherworldly hybrid strain that crosses Blissful Wizard with Fire Alien Kush. Bred by Sasquatch Gardens in California, Harry Potter casts a pacifying spell over the body, easing aches and pains while hushing anxiety.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Incredible Hulk\n\nIncredible Hulk is a sativa strain that harnesses the active and stimulating effects of its parent strains, Green Crack and Jack Herer. Creativity and social energy get a boost while blueberry, pineapple, and earthy flavors overwhelm the palate. This high-energy sativa is preferred as a daytime remedy for minor aches and pains.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Incredible Hulk\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Alf \n\nThe indica-dominant hybrid Alf was created by crossing Animal Pie (an Animal Cookies and Cherry Pie hybrid) and Black Raven (White Fire Alien OG x \u201909 Cookies) from The Captain\u2019s Connection. With dessert-like notes of cookies and sour cherry, Alf\u2019s aroma is as enticing as its purple crystal-coated buds. Patients seeking relief from pain, spasms, nausea, and appetite may want to give this relaxing hybrid a try.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Kraken\n\nKraken is a mythical strain of unknown parentage brought to us from Spanish breeder Buddha Seeds. Breeding with power and production in mind, this indica hybrid produces chunky, dense buds with a blanket of crystal resin. Producing big harvests and intensely euphoric effects, this monster of an indica lives up to its name.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Kraken\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Mt. Rainier\n\nAs beautiful as the snowcapped mountain this strain was named after, the resinous Mt. Rainier hybrid was bred by RedEyed Genetics and hails from the Pacific Northwest. Northern Lights #5 meets White Lotus to create these frosty flowers that unleash scents of sweet citrus and fresh pine. This hybrid is great for daytime use, but don\u2019t overdo it if you intend to stay functional and productive.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Mt. Rainier\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Malakoff\n\nBred by Medical Seeds Co., Malakoff is an 80/20 sativa-dominant strain that crosses Strawberry Haze and White Widow. Malakoff tends to hit with a strong cerebral effect, making it a great choice for users who prefer a creative and energizing high. It may also offer therapeutic qualities for those suffering from anxiety or depression. This strain flowers in about 70 to 75 days and can be harvested mid-October.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Snow Bud\n\nNamed after its snow-like resin and white pistils, Snow Bud by Dutch Passion is a hybrid that crosses Afghani and an unknown South African strain. With sweet cinnamon and sour skunk flavors, Snow Bud provides an uplifting and euphoric high. These mold and mildew-resistant plants do well indoors and flower in 7 to 8 weeks.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Snow Bud\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",

            "text": "I picked up  half oz of this for roughly $70 and since the first time I rolled it in paper and smoked it, it's been my favorite strain in my recreational habit. It's definitely Indica Dominant and you will feel that immediately. When it hits me I immediately feel the tensions and stress I dealt with throughout the day disappear and muscles loosen up as my body and mind wind down. One of the things I appreciate most about this rain is that I'm still able to function while on it. It is a very good strain, can be found at a really good price, taste and hits very smooth and is worth every single penny.",

            "text": "I just recently tried this strain for the first time today. Mt. Rainier is great for daytime use, or a \"wake and bake.\" I smoked one bowl of this strain at 8:50 am and got so high that I didn't come down until 12:30 pm. It's an amazing hybrid, just enough Indica to give you a powerful body high in the beginning, and not make you too tired. I came home and started to write a part of my sociology essay that is due in 9 days. And after reviewing it, it was clear that the paragraph I rewrote was so much better than the original questioned paragraph about how sociology is like/unlike hard science. The creativeness and focus this strain gave me was amazing. Mt. Rainier is a great strain to smoke when you have things to do, like feed four horses in the morning (I do that every morning) and write a new part of your sociology paper. 5 DAYS LATER. I woke up today (the day of my math 120 college test) and smoked one bowl of Mt. Rainier around 7:30 am and took my math 120 test at 10:30 am, I was still a little high and I took my time, and answered every question except for three which I did not know, and reviewed my answers before submitting. And I got a really good score, 85%! This is an unforgettable strain for a wake and bake.",
