This really boosted my creativity in many areas with cooking and doing art and just having awesome ideas about a lot of different topics in conversation with people. very talkative as well. id say a very enjoyable strain would for sure buy this again. one thing i did notice was a slight head ache after sobering up but nothing crazy.",
