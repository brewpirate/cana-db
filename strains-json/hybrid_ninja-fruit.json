I am growing it out now for the first time and it has been a very fun plant to grow. Very colorful.  It has a grape candy smell with a haze, woodsy backend as you pull your nose away.",

Have to admit, being from new england, you don't see much purple flower, actually in 25 years, I haven't seen any. It was like aborigines looking at a coke bottle when I opened up the container for the first time!",
