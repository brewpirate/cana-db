I woke up in pain from my back and hips which is pretty severe most days, I used NLX Skunk to medicate for the first time. I waited for the effects to kick in which took only a few minutes and my pain started to dissipate very quickly and it didn\u0027t put me on couch lock. I have plenty of energy to go about my day. So in all this has been a great high. Smooth smoke. Slightly earthy taste.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1606564,"username":"Jtucson","text":"Northern Skunk is by far my favorite strain I have come across. It always varies a little batch to batch but I found it to be the most consistent and very potent. It is a great saturday night smoke that can put you in a relaxed but coherent state. It is easy to be social and function on but at the same time, really helps anxiety and depression. Very uplifting!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":47,"flavors":[{"name":"Skunk","score":26.521739130434781},{"name":"Earthy","score":19.311594202898551},{"name":"Pungent","score":14.891304347826086},{"name":"Pine","score":7.7536231884057969},{"name":"Sweet","score":3.804347826086957}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":140.79710144927537},{"name":"Relaxed","score":134.74637681159419},{"name":"Uplifted","score":118.69565217391305},{"name":"Creative","score":108.76811594202898},{"name":"Talkative","score":104.96376811594203}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":21.485507246376812},{"name":"Insomnia","score":17.137681159420289},{"name":"Stress","score":16.992753623188406},{"name":"Headaches","score":13.804347826086957},{"name":"Depression","score":13.188405797101449}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":12.10144927536232},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":11.630434782608695},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":7.2101449275362324},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":5.5072463768115938},{"name":"PTSD","score":5.5072463768115938}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":17.065217391304348},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":8.7681159420289863},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.6304347826086956},{"name":"Paranoid","score":0.54347826086956519}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/northern-skunk_100x100_8fff.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1006180/b/northern-skunk__primary_eba4.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/northern-skunk_100x100_9198.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/653142/b/northern-skunk__primary_c095.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/northern-skunk_100x100_fe3b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/650926/b/northern-skunk__primary_7b9e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/northern-skunk_100x100_71c5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/636882/b/northern-skunk__primary_46da.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/northern-skunk_100x100_4e96.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/576430/b/northern-skunk__primary_548a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/northern-skunk_100x100_0efc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/537611/b/northern-skunk__primary_d4a5.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":17,"popularCities":["Phoenix, AZ","Tucson, AZ","Anchorage, AK","Casa Grande, AZ","Everson, WA","Glendale, AZ","Linwood, MI","Mesa, AZ","Mount Vernon, WA","Seattle, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/northern-skunk","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.48936170212766/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Northern Lights","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights","symbol":"Nl","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights"},{"name":"Super Skunk","subtitle":null,"slug":"super-skunk","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/super-skunk","symbol":"Ssk","applink":"leafly://strain/super-skunk"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
