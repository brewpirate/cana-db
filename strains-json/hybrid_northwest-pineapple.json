It has an enticing aroma of sweet, earthy pineapple with a Haze-like undertone. The taste is delicious, offering consumers a hint of citrus that intensifies upon exhaling. This strain expresses large, fluffy spade-shaped buds with mint green foliage and a thick layer of amber hairs. Northwest Pineapple has a happy and uplifting high that easily improves mood while going easy on the body.&nbsp;</p>\n",
