            "text": "Looking back at 2015, I can\u2019t help but play a nostalgic montage in my head of all the strains that came and went over the year. Legal markets are becoming saturated with choices, so much so that it\u2019s impossible to determine 2015\u2019s best cream of the crop. Instead, we took a look at the fastest growing strain trends based on Leafly reviews and determined which varieties made the biggest splash last year.\nDispensaries and rec shops, you better keep your eye out for these rising stars in 2016! You\u2019ll definitely want them blessing your shelves.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n#1. GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4)\n \nGG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4) blew it out of the water this year with an astounding 906% increase in user ratings and reviews. That kind of growth is pretty mind-blowing, but if you\u2019ve tried Gorilla Glue, it starts to make sense.\nEven through a sealed container, I could pick up every intricacy of its aroma: earthy pine soured by loud notes of skunky diesel. Trying to pry the buds apart, I can see how this champ got its name; the resin oozing from these trichomes might as well be heavy-duty adhesive. In describing the effects, I can say it no better than this Leafly reviewer who wrote, \u201cI needed a seatbelt for reality.\u201d Me too, dude.\n\u00a0\n#2. Critical Kush\n \nHeir to the Critical Mass throne is Critical Kush, an indica strain that saw a staggering 407% increase in user engagement this year. By crossing Critical Mass with the West Coast favorite OG Kush, it\u2019s no surprise that Critical Kush is taking off in the U.S. A subtle citrusy lemon OG aroma adds a layer of interest to Critical Mass\u2019 muted hashy and earthy flavors, and its moderate CBD content complements its THC-rich profile for beautifully relaxing effects that one Leafly user compares to a slow massage.\n\u00a0\n#3. Candyland\n \nCandyland grew almost 380% this year, making it the fastest growing sativa among Leafly users in 2015. The first thing most people note about this strain is its strikingly sweet flavor, a quality that\u2019s earned this strain her name. Its twisting hues of blue, purple, white, and green are also something to write home about, as well as its dueling effects that balance gracefully between relaxing and uplifting. Candyland has been called \u201ca work of art\u201d by Leafly users, while another claimed it was \u201cBy far one of the best strains I had of 2015.\u201d Apparently everyone else agrees.\n\u00a0\n#4. ACDC\n \nNext up is ACDC, a high-CBD hybrid that grew 356% this year. I believe it. A lot of high-CBD strains I\u2019ve tried have a grassy, hay-like aroma and a scraggly appearance, but ACDC is a refreshingly beautiful anomaly. Sweet, zesty lemon notes burst from its crystal-coated buds in an impressively fragrant introduction to its relaxing, clear-headed effects. Reviewers rave over its ability to chase off pain and anxiety without cerebral euphoria or mental cloudiness, which can make all the difference in many medical patients\u2019 lives.\n\u00a0\n#5. Bubblegum Kush\n \nStep aside, Bubble Gum. Your Kush-infused offspring is taking center stage with a yearly growth rate of 284%. Maintaining a sweet floral and bubble gum aroma, this hybrid gets its enhanced resin production from its hash monster of its second parent, Hindu Kush. It may anchor your body with a physical heaviness, but many reviewers claim this strain still leaves the mind agile and motivated.\n\u00a0\n#6. Sunset Sherbet\n \nOnce upon a time, you\u2019d see its parent GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) on this list, so it comes as no surprise that the offspring Sunset Sherbert is dominating the market with a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 276%. As one reviewer wrote, Sunset Sherbert \u201csmells as if heaven cracked open its Mason jars and said \u2018enjoy.\u2019\u201d Yes, it\u2019s that good.\n\u00a0\n#7. Tangie\n \nClimbing 236% in ratings and reviews this year, the Tangie sativa is a flavor masterpiece. Its aroma spans the entire citrus spectrum with fruity notes of orange, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. Even if this strain didn\u2019t have its amazingly uplifting and upbeat effects, I bet you\u2019d still buy this strain for its flavor alone.\n\u00a0\n#8. Jedi Kush\n \nEither Star Wars fans spent the entirety of 2015 enjoying Jedi Kush in anticipation of the new sequel or it really is that good, because this indica grew 235% among Leafly visitors. It hits with the force of a Jedi master, delivering heavy-handed euphoria that\u2019ll launch you to a galaxy far, far away.\n\u00a0\n#9. Animal Cookies\n \nAlso called Animal Crackers, this powerhouse hybrid hiked 224% in 2015. This one\u2019s known to reach impressively high THC heights and provide stupefying effects that can knock out even the most seasoned veteran. As one Leafly reviewer poetically describes it, Animal Cookies is a \u201csoothing, nap-time, I-wish-I-had-money-for-pizza, loving-my-1,000-thread-count-sheets strain.\u201d\n\u00a0\n#10. OG #18\n \nWith an annual growth rate of 210%, OG #18 (AKA Private Reserve) gained quite a bit of momentum this year. This supreme OG Kush phenotype has snagged numerous awards for its potency, and fans of OG genetics will appreciate how this hybrid captures and enhances the most cherished qualities of OG Kush: its pungent diesel, lemon, and pine flavors; a thick and sticky coat of resin; high-flying euphoria; and pain-relieving anesthetic effects that patients gush over.\nDispensaries, you might want to update your Leafly listing menus to include these trending strains. Don\u2019t have a Leafly listing? We can fix that!",

            "text": "Over the 420 holiday weekend, DOPE Magazine celebrated their 4th annual DOPE Cup at 7-Point Studios in Seattle. The celebration was sponsored by Leafly and showcased some of the region\u2019s best cannabis flower, concentrates, edibles, topicals, glass artists, and accessories. Even a last-minute venue change couldn\u2019t stop the stream of cannabis lovers from overflowing the state fair-themed event that came complete with infused cotton candy, a mechanical joint to ride, magicians, performers, artists, and more. Honestly, the only thing missing was a medicated corn\u00a0dog to combat my munchies.\nAs expected, the dab bar was the hive that everyone was buzzing around, with a variety of solvent and solventless concentrates to sample from some of the best extract artists in the area. The highlight had to be local artist Scott Deppe\u2019s crystal skull piece that sat at the X-Tracted bar and captured every passer-by with its intricate design and whopping 6-figure price tag. Those who weren\u2019t concentrated around the dab rigs were busy sampling edibles, entering raffles, and relaxing with a massage at one the topical\u00a0company booths.\n\nA judge\u2019s pass to the event allowed visitors to join the action by sampling each of the strains entered into the People's\u00a0Choice category of the Cup. For $99, the judge\u2019s pass gave ticket-holders a half gram sample of all 10 anonymous strains and the opportunity to vote for their favorite. The mystery strains all had amazing flavors, ranging from sweet and tropical to earthy and piney, which made it all the more difficult to choose a favorite.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the DOPE Cup winners!\n\u00a0\nFlower Winners\n\n\u00a0\nPeople's Choice Flower\n\nWinner: CPC or Cotton Purple Chem\u00a0by\u00a0Hesperides Gardens (Strain #4)\n\u00a0\nJudges' Choice Flower\n\nWinner: The Sauce\u00a0by\u00a0ExoticGenetix (Strain #6)\n\u00a0\nBest Indica\n\nWinner: Cascadia Kush by Hesperides Gardens\nRunner Up: The White from Cannabis Club by Freak UV Nature\n\u00a0\nBest Sativa\n\nWinner: Matanuska Thunder Fuck by TJ's Gardens\nRunner Up: Head Cheese from Cali Connection\n\u00a0\nBest Hybrid\n\nWinner: Peppermint Cookies by GoldLeaf Gardens\nRunner Up: GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) by Rain City Cannabis & Top Shelf\n\u00a0\nHighest THC\n\nWinner: The White (29.9%) by Solstice\nRunner Up: DT-13 (28.7%) by Patient 99 Care\n\u00a0\nHighest CBD\n\nWinner: ACDC (18.05%) by Loaded Soda\nRunner Up: ACDC x Charlotte's Web (17.02%) by B-EZ and Fweedom\n\u00a0\nConcentrate Winners\n\n\u00a0\nBest BHO \u2013 THC\nWinner: Marmalade (94.36%) from Platinum Extracts\nRunner Up: Private Reserve OG (83.73%) from The Baker\u00e9\u00e9\n\u00a0\nBest BHO \u2013 CBD\n\nWinner: Sour Tsunami (83.7%) from Solstice by Refine\nRunner Up: Sour Tsunami (74.08%) by Stoney Extracts\n\u00a0\nBest CO2 \u2013 THC\nWinner: Mixed Berry (48.56%, 110 ppm) by Evergreen Extracts\nRunner Up: Death Star (69.09%, <10 ppm) by Happy Cats \u2013 CO2 Organics\n\u00a0\nBest CO2 \u2013 CBD\n\nWinner: ACDC x Remedy (78% CBD, <10 ppm) by Loaded Soda \u2013 CO2 Organics\nRunner Up: Evergreen Extracts (42.81% CBD, <10 ppm)\n\u00a0\nBest Non-Solvent \u2013 THC\n\nWinner: Kimbo Kush (84.37%, dry sift) Cuban Tech from Exotic Genetics\nRunner Up: Fire On the Mountain (82.68%) from\u00a0NW Alchemy featuring Head Hunter\n\u00a0\nBest Non-Solvent \u2013 CBD\n\nWinner: Remedy (52.5% CBD, 3390 ppm ethanol) by Hesperides Gardens\nRunner Up: ACDC (13.41% CBD bubble hash) Loaded Soda by CO2 Organics\n\u00a0\nEdible Winners\n\n\u00a0\nBest Edible \u2013 Savory\nWinner: Delux Nut Mix by Laurie and Marry Jane\nRunner Up: Capitol Hill Peanut Butter\n\u00a0\nBest Edible \u2013 Sweet\nWinner: Dark Chocolate Fudge by Mad Monster\nRunner Up: Almond Bites by Laurie and Marry Jane\n\u00a0\nBest Edible \u2013 Drink\nWinner: Loaded Soda Root Beer \u2013 104.85 mg THC\nRunner Up: Sensi Sweet Tropical Punch \u2013 58.68 mg THC\n\u00a0\nBest Edible \u2013 CBD\nWinner: Vanilla Truffles from The Bakeree\u00a0\u2013 Cookie Fam Genetics\nRunner Up: Slips by Oakor\n\u00a0\nBest Topical\nWinner: Kush Cream Cherry Bomb \u2013 2.01 mg THC\nRunner Up: Liberty Lotion High CBD \u2013 1.67 mg CBD",

I was pretty chatty on the phone with people and felt a little \"outside of myself\" during the day (re-hit about 4 hours after 1st use, and again before bed) but that could be due to a complete lack of sleep two nights earlier.\nOG18 is one badass pain killer that isn't too psychoactive.
