            "text": "Cannabis is a flower. And like flowers, cannabis exhibits strong, diverse odors that will stimulate your mind and elicit different sensations based on those smells (and, when smoked, flavors). These smell- and flavor-inducing chemicals are known as terpenes, which are representative of potential effects inside each unique flower. Linalool, for example, is a powerful terpene most commonly associated with lavender. It\u2019s known for its relaxing, sedative effects \u2014 the same thing people hope to inspire when they place a pouch of lavender under their pillows before bed.\n\nCannabis is a flower. Lavender is a flower. So what? Flowers smell like flowers.\nWait. Hold your horses, y\u2019all. Here\u2019s where it gets weird.\nOf all the terpenes, of which more than 200 are found in cannabis, many evoke smells that don\u2019t occur naturally in nature. Today, we are going to focus on a few terpenes near and dear to my heart (and stomach): CHEESE!\nThe \u201ccheesy\u201d terpenes are easily some of the most pungent and challenging. But the strains reward the adventurous palate with brilliant, uplifting effects that are pleasantly stimulating and luscious.\n\nSuch terpenes include octanoic acid, (methyl thio) butyrate, ethylmethyl acetic acid, hexanoic acid, isovaleric acid, and methyl mercaptan. These chemicals traverse the scale of cheesiness from the sweet, vanilla ice cream elements of Dairy Queen to the significantly cave-aged earthiness of OG Cheese and UK Cheese.\nBut cheese strains aren\u2019t exclusively savory. Like many fine cheese plates, fruit notes add a complementary sweetness to the umami qualities of a truly robust queso. Strains like Blueberry Cheesecake, Blue Cheese, Sweet Cheese, Bubble Cheese, and many more incorporate sweet elements that can bring creeping indica effects to this primarily sativa-hybrid family.\nCheese terpenes may not be the most pleasant to smell, but they are everywhere. Check out this quote by THCFarmer.com pertaining to one of the many cheese-like terpenes:\n\u201cIsovaleric Acid has a strong, pungent, sour, stinky feet, sweaty cheese smell. It is a major component of the cause of unpleasant foot odor. However, its volatile esters have pleasing scents and are used widely in perfumery. Used as a flavoring it is cheesy, dairy, sweet creamy, fermented, waxy and berry. It has shown effectiveness as an anticonvulsant and antidepressant.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t a recommendation to huff your stinky socks in an effort to conquer depression, but a simple illustration of the fine line between the refined and the repulsive. So go on: Grab a bowl, smile, and say, \u201ccheese!\u201d Looking for some options? Check the \u201ccheese\u201d filter in our strain explorer for some pungent options!",

            "text": "From the mountains of Colombia to the hills of China, we'd like to introduce you to some new strains that will expand your global palate. Genetics from the U.K. contributed to the birth of OG Cheese and Cheesewreck, two potent hybrids that deliver jarring euphoria with that unmistakable sour smell from Cheese.

            "text": "Alright, OG cheese is one for the books. It has an earthy taste with an amazing after taste. But some downfalls are the possibility of sore throat, the munchies, blurred vision (may or may not be a negative depending on who you are), and on rare occasions it can cause a headache, dry mouth, and even paranoia. There are positives though! This strain will make you giggly, peaceful, and can even help with foot pain, neck pain, and as a muscle relaxer! Although negatives are a factor...THE OVER ALL HIGH ITSELF IS WORTH IT ALL!!! You become ingenuitive and creative beyond typical means. It is wonderful! Ideas will spawn out of what seems to be thin air! I recommend this strain to anyone who has an open mind for all things and who seeks a creative aspect for their creative minds.",
