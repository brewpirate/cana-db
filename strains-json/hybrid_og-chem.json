A 50/50 hybrid, Cherry OG truly brings you the best of both sativa and indica worlds as it delivers full-body euphoria alongside high-flying cerebral lucidity.

WSU\n\nWSU is a Washington-grown rendition of the indica strain Chemo and it\u2019s waiting for you on the shelves of recreational stores state-wide. Named in homage to Washington State University, don\u2019t confuse this strain with the UW indica, whose name is derived from the rivaling University of Washington. Its effects are described as relaxed and spacey. Citrus and berry flavors invade the palate on the inhale, providing a flavorful introduction to WSU\u2019s heavy indica effects.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying WSU\n\u00a0\n 3. Tommy's Home Grown\n\nTommy\u2019s Home Grown, or THG for short, is a balanced hybrid strain that falls under the \u201cChong Certified\u201d label.

This sativa brings a newfound vibrancy to the senses, allowing you to unlock creativity and appreciation of your surroundings.\n\n\u00a0\n 5. SinMint Cookies\n\nSinMint Cookies is Sin City Seeds\u2019 signature hybrid cross between GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) and Blue Power.

Training Day\n\nBred by DNA Genetics, Training Day is a 70% indica that combines parent strains Trainwreck and LA Confidential. This California native takes after its LA Confidential parent in aroma and delivers a pungent earthy and pine flavor. As demonstrated by its thick blanket of crystal resin, Training Day will put your THC tolerance to the test so novices should approach this strain with caution.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Training Day\n\u00a0\n 7. OG Chem\n\nOG Chem, also called Chem OG, is a sativa-dominant cross between two legendary strains, Chemdawg and OG Kush.

First time smokers keep in mind this shit sends you into stratosphere when it comes to a trippy head high. Best smoke for a hike through the woods or up a mountain, this is trippy \"dig into nature\" weed to the very core. Rip a bowl, go for a long hike and wait for the creep, OG Chem is a true head banger. ",
