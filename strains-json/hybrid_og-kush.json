            "text": "I\u2019m in the middle of remodeling my house right now, which means I haven\u2019t been at home as much to use my daily driver like I normally would. Instead, I\u2019ve been dabbing with one of my travel rigs. When I don\u2019t have the comforts and tools that I have at home, I like to keep things as simple as possible. After dealing with broken glass and messy \u201coil spills\u201d while out and about over the years, I\u2019ve discovered a few tips and tricks for dabbing on the go.\nCompact Size\nWhen it comes to dabbing away from home, the size of the rig is most important to me. Keeping my travel rig small without losing functionality is absolutely essential. Rigs can get tiny these days\u2013like ridiculously tiny. I don\u2019t want it to be so small that I burn my eyebrows with a hot nail.\u00a0 Instead, I prefer something palm-sized, discreet, and easy to pack away.\n\u00a0\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\nI\u2019ve been known to break glass smokeware a time or two. So, I\u2019ll often snag an inexpensive rig with simple functionality, especially when I\u2019m traveling to other cities and know I won\u2019t be staying long. I picked up a Mini Bell Bubbler last time I needed a dab rig in a pinch. There\u2019s nothing fancy about this rig. It\u2019s a simple design that chugs nicely and provides a solid rip. I got it for less than $50, so if it breaks or gets lost, I\u2019m not suffering any major damages.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bd0raXpHlBo/?taken-by=tacodabs\nMess-Free\nI\u2019m definitely not the most orderly person you\u2019ll meet. If I didn\u2019t have a dog to vacuum them up, I\u2019d leave a trail of crumbs in my wake everywhere I go. But when I\u2019m dabbing on the go, I try to keep things as clean and contained as possible to avoid leaving behind sticky bits of resin and flecks of hash on other people\u2019s tables. To help me prevent a mess, I use the standard accessories of the dab world: silicone containers and dab mats. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve forgotten a dab mat on a vacation and ended up with oil all over everything (myself included). While there\u2019s some conversation over whether you should store terpene-rich oil in silicone containers long-term, I find them useful in the short-term.\nHigh quality silicone is non-stick and resistant to the heat of low temperature dabs. That means I can easily scoop up every bit of hash in the container with my dab tool. It also means that if my nail is still hot at the end of a session but it\u2019s time to go, I can use it like an oven mitt to remove it from the rig. That way I can set it aside to cool while I\u2019m cleaning up and putting my rig away.\nExplore Dabbing Accessories\nCleanability\nThat brings me to my next point: find a rig with easy \u201ccleanability.\u201d Like my daily driver, I prefer a travel rig without too many intricate pathways for the reclaim to get trapped or clogged. My travel rig is generally easy to keep clean. It gets used less often than my daily glass does, and out of necessity, I change the water before every use. Typically, it gets a thorough cleaning before a trip and after I return. So ideally, find something that is easy to clean often, and will only take a few minutes to wash with some warm alcohol.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BdzEZKOhm06/?taken-by=the.avid.dabber\nFlavor\nYou\u2019ll probably get tired of hearing me say this but: flavor, flavor, flavor! A quality dab should highlight the complex flavors of the strain it came from. Last time, I told you how I prefer quartz nails for their ability to preserve the true essence of the hash I\u2019m dabbing. With my travel rig, I use a quartz banger. It\u2019s a small bucket attachment made from quality quartz that retains heat well, is simple to wipe clean after every dab, and allows for dabs of any size. Most glass enthusiasts prefer quartz bangers for their aesthetic as well. The clear quartz doesn\u2019t detract from the beautiful colors and designs that glass collectors spend top-dollar for, and avoids the more industrial look of titanium attachments.\nAvid Dab of the Week\nI\u2019m still enjoying the spoils of the holiday gifting season (a cannabis enthusiast is easy to shop for). This Double Tangie Banana was one of the best cannabis gifts I received, and I\u2019m still savoring the last few dabs in the container.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BdjssYghRYg/?taken-by=the.avid.dabber\nExtracted by Oleum Extracts, this Sugar Resin is a stable consistency; it\u2019s not too sticky and easy to scoop up. It tested at 85% total cannabinoids and nearly 4% total terpenes. The strain was developed by Crockett Family Farms and has an amazing terpene profile full of overripe fruit notes bursting with decadent flavors.\nHow do you dab on the go? Share your setup on Instagram and tag me (@the.avid.dabber) and use #aviddabber. Or tell me what\u2019s up in the comments section below. Standby for next week when I\u2019ll breakdown dabbing at different temperatures. In the meantime, ONLY DAB THE BEST!",

Leafly and\u00a0General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Tahoe OG Kush is a potent phenotype of OG Kush popularly used for relaxation and sleep. With a sweet earthy flavor, Tahoe OG Kush delivers heavy-handed effects that are best paired with lazy evenings in.\nGrow Techniques: Indoors, Tahoe OG Kush performs well with the SOG (sea of green) method. Hydroponically, you can grow beautiful buds with unbelievable resin production. Prune the lower canopy for good airflow and keep humidity levels down when the plants begin to show density in the buds.\nFlowering Time: 9-10 weeks\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Ideally kept between 65-80 degrees Fahrenheit. Tahoe OG Kush needs good ventilation and lower humidity levels as it begins to flower (30-40% RH).\nIndoor/Outdoor: In the right climate, Tahoe OG Kush will produce large, quality yields indoors or out.\nFeeding: Feed heavily. Calcium, magnesium, and nitrogen are recommended for Tahoe OG Kush.",
