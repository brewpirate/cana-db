            "text": "I use this bud to alleviate insomnia, and to curb cravings for alcohol and opiates. All three goals are met with this flower. It is deep, dark green with some orange hairs and lightly crystalized. \n\n\n\nThe aroma is nutty, with a strong presence of pine. I am not an aficionado when it comes to flavor, but I would say it tastes the way it smells but more mild. The smoke is on the harsh side, with some heavy expansion so be prepared. You will feel the effects upon the first exhale as I find this to be a fairly potent strain.",

So I made a mistake and rolled a joint with my boyfriend in the morning for wake and bake. I felt my head too heavy and instantly went back to bed. Also I had 2 bad trips from the first 2 joints I ever smoked from this strain. It leaves the worst taste of mud in your mouth. I guess this strain is not the best one for me but it serves its purpose.",
