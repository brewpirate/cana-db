Lots of amber trichs, not your usual color scheme.\nSmell/Taste: I was a little dissapointed that it diddnt have more of a strawberry smell, the OG used was citrus diesel leaning in flavor, and that shows in this cross but with a slight starwberry/fruity twist,and a hint of pine diesel at the end. Very nice flavor profile, even if the og dominates it a little. If youve read my reviews, you know im a flavor snob, almost more so than the high.\nEffects: A blissful euphoric ride of relaxation. Pain melts away, stress and anxiety are gone. Had me really engaged in a movie. Loveley for a late night because it doesnt put you to sleep right away, but about 90mins in you start to get the heavy eyes. Definetly worth trying, but this will get lost in the mix of all the other OGs, was hoping for a strawberry diesel flav, not with this one.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1643224,"username":"Daniepenn","text":"one of the best strains I have tried AMAZING!!!!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3437","title":"New Strains Alert: White Walker Kush, MediHaze, OG Strawberry, Royal Highness, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1428691860000)\/","text":"We\u0027ve got new strains for you to check out! This week\u0027s highlights include some new high-CBD varieties, some potent painkilling indicas, and even a hybrid to help you celebrate the season 5 premiere of Game of Thrones this weekend (and White Walker Kush isn\u0027t the only GoT-themed strain to help you enjoy Sunday\u0027s debut…).\nRemember to leave a strain review if you\u0027ve had the chance to try any of the varieties below!\n \n   1. White Walker Kush\n\nDNA Genetics’ White Walker Kush (not to be confused with Whitewalker OG) is a hybrid cross of elite parent strains White Widow (Ingemar cut) and Skywalker. Taking after its White Widow mother, this 60/40 sativa-dominant strain comes blanketed in a snow-like layer of crystal resin. The influence of Skywalker is apparent in White Walker Kush’s heavily relaxing effects which are best reserved for a lazy evening in. Boosting both mood and appetite, White Walker Kush is a great choice for patients treating conditions like anorexia or cachexia.\n\n \n   2. OG Strawberry\n\nOG Strawberry, grown on the southwest ridge line of Mendocino County by HappyDays Farms, is an indica-dominant hybrid strain that delivers crushing effects alongside a sour fuel aroma. With a THC content that can stretch to 29%, OG Strawberry is a force to be reckoned with. This hybrid combines parent strains OG Kush and Island Strawberry Afghani Indica, a union of potency that will impress even the seasoned veteran.\n\n \n   3. Double Purple Doja\n\nDouble Purple Doja is an indica strain that crosses Sputnik #1 with Black Russian, a parentage that gives rise to powerfully euphoric effects and a musky blackberry aroma. This indica is best saved for late night use, but its sedating qualities won’t entirely pull the plug on social or creative activities if enjoyed earlier in the day. Most notable is its deep purple coloration, and breeders often turn to Double Purple Doja genetics when creating new purple varieties. Though originally bred by TGA Genetics, Double Purple Doja is largely propagated by breeders Outlaw and Matthew Riot.\n\n \n   4. MediHaze\n\nMediHaze (or CBD Medi Haze) is an 80/20 sativa-dominant strain bred by CBD Crew that crosses genetics from Super Silver Haze, Neville’s Haze, and an undisclosed CBD-rich parent. Its THC to CBD ratio typically comes out 1:1, but some seeds will offer a doubled CBD content. THC and CBD’s synergy provide relief to a variety of symptoms, some of which include pain, inflammation, and anxiety. Pine, mint, and spice aromas burst from MediHaze buds in a fragrant introduction to its clear-headed, uplifting effects.\n\n \n   5. Ogre Berry\n\nOgre Berry is an indica-dominant strain cultivated in the highlands of Northern Mendocino County by HappyDay Farms. Combining Ogre with Island Strawberry Afghani Indica, Ogre Berry regularly tests between 24-28% THC and offers potent relief to aches and pains. Heavy euphoria blankets the mind with sensations of calm relaxation, and while these effects come with great medicinal potential, you may want to set this strain aside when faced with a busy day or cognitive tasks. Sweet citrus flavors meet a fuel-like skunk aroma, creating a sweet and sour fusion to be enjoyed by terpene enthusiasts.\n\n \n   6. Royal Highness\n\nRoyal Highness is a hybrid bred by Royal Queen Seeds. Its combination of Dance Hall and Respect genetics express themselves in a nearly balanced THC:CBD ratio. While indica in stature, the effects of Royal Highness are led by its sativa influence. The result is an active, energetic buzz that rewards consumers with a clear head along with its therapeutic qualities. The smooth flavors of Royal Highness bring to mind sweet fruit and skunky spice, making this strain an enjoyable answer to anxiety and chronic pain.\n\n \n   7. Cluster Bomb\n\nCluster Bomb is an indica-dominant hybrid bred by Bomb Seeds. This strain takes the soaring sativa effects of Cinderella 99 and crosses them with Bomb #1, a proprietary strain that Bomb Seeds uses to influence their genetics. This blend is then crossed with original Skunk #1 genetics from Sensi Seeds to give us Cluster Bomb. Cluster Bomb is known for producing large commercial yields of rich skunky buds that are sweetened by notes of strawberry and citrus. The relaxing indica effects are balanced by the cerebral energy provided by Cinderella 99 genetics.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/12002454/new-strains-alert-white-walker-kush-medihaze-og-strawberry-royal.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-white-walker-kush-medihaze-og-strawberry-royal"}],"reviewCount":26,"flavors":[{"name":"Berry","score":105.55555555555556},{"name":"Strawberry","score":35.185185185185183},{"name":"Sweet","score":22.685185185185183},{"name":"Earthy","score":14.351851851851851},{"name":"Skunk","score":13.425925925925926}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":125.46296296296296},{"name":"Happy","score":119.9074074074074},{"name":"Euphoric","score":117.12962962962963},{"name":"Creative","score":18.981481481481481},{"name":"Uplifted","score":14.351851851851851}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":118.98148148148148},{"name":"Pain","score":118.05555555555556},{"name":"Fatigue","score":101.85185185185185},{"name":"Inflammation","score":101.85185185185185},{"name":"Headaches","score":100.92592592592592}],"conditions":[{"name":"Cancer","score":100},{"name":"PTSD","score":14.351851851851851},{"name":"Anxiety","score":4.62962962962963},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.8518518518518516},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":1.8518518518518516}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":4.62962962962963},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.92592592592592582},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":0.92592592592592582}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/og-strawberry_100x100_609c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/519211/b/og-strawberry__primary_abb8.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/og-strawberry_100x100_c1f2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/500396/b/og-strawberry__primary_3da7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/og-strawberry_100x100_0c0e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494269/b/og-strawberry__primary_ec65.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/og-strawberry_100x100_c51a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/428273/b/og-strawberry__primary_33c6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/og-strawberry_100x100_2c32.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/376597/b/og-strawberry__primary_c027.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/og-strawberry_100x100_13f9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/350629/b/og-strawberry__primary_e648.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":10,"popularCities":["Detroit, MI","Moffat, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-strawberry","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.46153846153846/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"},{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
