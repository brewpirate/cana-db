For me the affects are almost seconds after the first hit. Its a very good \"chill\" high but it also is good in party settings, i would recommend for big smokers so you can get the forst high feeling all over again ","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/YEN1LqXiYCOvWiFhmP-4p67iqDM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fY9fB9qHySLml8016ysgJ_goggles-green.png"},{"id":1627117,"username":"Skiddy4600","text":"Very strong strain, reminded me of my first time smoking weed.
