            "text": "A friend of mine who grows developed this strain. Its genetics inclued blueberry, afghani, and haze clone crossed with bubba kush. The high was very strong and long lasting. A 2g blunt will keep 4 people very high for around 4-5 hours. The nugs were small, extremely dense, and covered in orange hairs. This bud looks like it was dipped in resin. Even though its genetics are mostly indicas the high was very energetic and sativa like. After smoking a blunt everything is much more fun to do, and everything seems brighter. After smoking this my heart started racing in my chest. Cant wait for the next batch of this. This bud is great if you wanna get high as fuck for a very long time.",
