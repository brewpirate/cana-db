With a terpene profile rich in limonene and pinene, Old Toby uplifts the mind and blankets the body in a trainquility that is medicinal without being sedating. The genetic lineage of Old Toby is hard to pin down due to the nearly decade-long breeding process Gordon undertook developing the strain. As fans may already know, this is the pipe-weed Gandalf enjoyed in J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s book, The Hobbit.&nbsp;</p>\n",

I've tried it 4x; what I've noticed is its analgesic quality - as good or better than any strain I've tried (purple arrow is probably next-best for that); its creative/project-y trait, and the fact that it's relatively clear-headed. it also seems to be long-lasting, so I ended up feeling the effects (wanting to move around, wanting to make art) longer than average. if you're a fan of oddball strains, this is definitely worth checking out. clear(ish) head, body analgesic, long-lasting, project-y: I can't think of another strain anything like it.",
