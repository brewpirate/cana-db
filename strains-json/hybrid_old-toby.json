I\u0027ve tried it 4x; what I\u0027ve noticed is its analgesic quality - as good or better than any strain I\u0027ve tried (purple arrow is probably next-best for that); its creative/project-y trait, and the fact that it\u0027s relatively clear-headed. it also seems to be long-lasting, so I ended up feeling the effects (wanting to move around, wanting to make art) longer than average. if you\u0027re a fan of oddball strains, this is definitely worth checking out. clear(ish) head, body analgesic, long-lasting, project-y: I can\u0027t think of another strain anything like it.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1379081,"username":"mairinn","text":"This feels great.
