Episode 15\nWashington’s Best Tasting Strains From Fall 2017\n\nKosher Kush by Santa Cruz Veteran’s Alliance\nAvailable in: California\nThe high-THC indica Kosher Kush is the perfect strain to crush symptoms of PTSD, and the Santa Cruz Veteran’s Alliance—owned and operated by military veterans—produces this pain-relieving strain for those suffering.

We love that they slow down and take a little time with their cannabis crops from start to finish.\n\nPineapple by Fire Bros.\nAvailable in: Washington\nA Seattle favorite, Fire Bros. works with their own phenotypes to produce the most effective cannabis flower for consumers. For an uplifting hybrid strain such as Pineapple, stress-relieving characteristics are an important facet enhanced by Fire Bros.’ hand-selection process.\nHybrid Blend by Lowell Farms\nAvailable in: California\nLowell Farms, which works exclusively with flower, offers seasonal blends of their best strains, and we can’t get enough of their hybrid pre-rolls. We appreciate that they’re thinking outside the box in focusing on balanced flower mixes rather than strain-specific products. Grown in organic fertilizer free of pesticides, Lowell takes pride in their dedication to all-natural cannabis as well as in providing good wages for their workers.\nAlso featured in: What Are You Smoking? Episode 3\nZkittlez by Royal Choice Farms\nAvailable in: Arizona\nArizona does not require pesticide testing for cannabis, so it’s all the more important to find a grower you can trust.

By instating natural grow methods, Royal Choice keeps our minds at ease when we’re lighting up their sweet indica Zkittles.\n\nCBD Blue Shark by Marley Natural Red\nAvailable in: California, Oregon, Washington*\nWith a full cannabis operation dedicated to Jamaica’s rich culture, Marley Natural hits it out of the park with their hand-selected flower line—notably, the anti-inflammatory and CBD-rich hybrid CBD Blue Shark. Cultivated by independent growers, we love Marley Natural’s dedication to craft cannabis, their commitment to sustainable growing practices, and their RISE UP social justice program.\nBlack Cherry Soda by Royal Tree Gardens\nAvailable in: Washington\nHaving built a facility from the ground up, Washington’s Royal Tree Gardens is a company steeped in perseverance.

We’ve been packing our bowls with this strain for its potent relief, particularly for the medical patients among us.\nDo-Si-Dos by Matrix NV\nAvailable in: Nevada\nOne of the best in medical-grade cannabis production, Nevada’s Matrix NV keeps their focus on the people who will consume their products, and that’s why we love them. Their flower, including the deliciously heavy indica Do-Si-Dos, is cared for by a team of passionate people who use purified and organic products to cultivate their hand-trimmed flower collection.\nAlso featured in: Leafly TV’s Growers: Episode 101\n\nOrange Blossom by Falcanna\nAvailable in: Washington\nA small medical operation turned Tier III licensed producer, Falcanna has seen it all when comes to cannabis—from the garden to the shop. Their dedication to the herb started as a dream between founders Bethany and Justin Rondeau and turned into a full grow facility delivering exceptional cannabis across Washington State. Their bright, floral hybrid Orange Blossom is as tasty as it is elevating and provides a perfect example of their dedication to quality flower.\nWhite Tahoe Cookies by Archive Portland\nAvailable in: Oregon\nWith multiple awards under their belt, Archive Portland boasts a team of growers with over 35 years of collective cannabis growing experience. That dedication to quality trickles down to the buds, where the exceptional indica White Tahoe Cookies takes on a smooth sedative high that keeps us coming back for more.\nLemonder by Seattle’s Private Reserve\nAvailable in: Washington\nWe save Seattle’s Private Reserve flower for special occasions; grown in a facility that is tightly sealed and meticulously controlled, the euphoric hybrid Lemonder has found its way into our stash boxes and smoke circles throughout 2017. SPR’s rigorous testing of all their cannabis products lets us consume with full peace of mind.\nLead image by Nastasic/iStock\n*Editor’s note: Leafly and Marley Natural are owned by the same parent company.

Utilize this strain to stimulate appetite while reducing stress. \u0026nbsp;\n","aka":null,"rating":4.56,"highlightedReviews":[{"id":1411062,"username":"BrettKBG","text":"Thanks Leafly! I suggested they add this strain.\n\nOrange Blossom by Falcanna out of north west Washington State is truly something special. With a THC level of 27% and a cannabinoid total of 33.4% it definitely caught my attention.  But holy moly! ORANGE SODA!! The aroma and flavor was without a doubt the best and most unique orange or citrus strain I\u0027ve ever tried.  I can\u0027t describe it as anything but the taste you get when you crack open a fresh Fanta.  It\u0027s so crisp and refreshing! The appearance itself is gorgeous! I\u0027ll upload a picture, but it\u0027s buds are covered in trichomes with bright orange hairs. The effects of this lady are sensational, if you want a function-able indica here she is.  You\u0027ll be left happy, hungry, and clear headed.  I really can\u0027t brag on this strain enough, if I could give 6 stars I would.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"},{"id":1614343,"username":"Sascoltch","text":"Has a nice citrus smell and taste to it.

Episode 15\nWashington’s Best Tasting Strains From Fall 2017\n\nKosher Kush by Santa Cruz Veteran’s Alliance\nAvailable in: California\nThe high-THC indica Kosher Kush is the perfect strain to crush symptoms of PTSD, and the Santa Cruz Veteran’s Alliance—owned and operated by military veterans—produces this pain-relieving strain for those suffering.

We appreciate that they’re thinking outside the box in focusing on balanced flower mixes rather than strain-specific products. Grown in organic fertilizer free of pesticides, Lowell takes pride in their dedication to all-natural cannabis as well as in providing good wages for their workers.\nAlso featured in: What Are You Smoking? Episode 3\nZkittlez by Royal Choice Farms\nAvailable in: Arizona\nArizona does not require pesticide testing for cannabis, so it’s all the more important to find a grower you can trust.

By instating natural grow methods, Royal Choice keeps our minds at ease when we’re lighting up their sweet indica Zkittles.\n\nCBD Blue Shark by Marley Natural Red\nAvailable in: California, Oregon, Washington*\nWith a full cannabis operation dedicated to Jamaica’s rich culture, Marley Natural hits it out of the park with their hand-selected flower line—notably, the anti-inflammatory and CBD-rich hybrid CBD Blue Shark. Cultivated by independent growers, we love Marley Natural’s dedication to craft cannabis, their commitment to sustainable growing practices, and their RISE UP social justice program.\nBlack Cherry Soda by Royal Tree Gardens\nAvailable in: Washington\nHaving built a facility from the ground up, Washington’s Royal Tree Gardens is a company steeped in perseverance.

We’ve been packing our bowls with this strain for its potent relief, particularly for the medical patients among us.\nDo-Si-Dos by Matrix NV\nAvailable in: Nevada\nOne of the best in medical-grade cannabis production, Nevada’s Matrix NV keeps their focus on the people who will consume their products, and that’s why we love them. Their flower, including the deliciously heavy indica Do-Si-Dos, is cared for by a team of passionate people who use purified and organic products to cultivate their hand-trimmed flower collection.\nAlso featured in: Leafly TV’s Growers: Episode 101\n\nOrange Blossom by Falcanna\nAvailable in: Washington\nA small medical operation turned Tier III licensed producer, Falcanna has seen it all when comes to cannabis—from the garden to the shop. Their dedication to the herb started as a dream between founders Bethany and Justin Rondeau and turned into a full grow facility delivering exceptional cannabis across Washington State. Their bright, floral hybrid Orange Blossom is as tasty as it is elevating and provides a perfect example of their dedication to quality flower.\nWhite Tahoe Cookies by Archive Portland\nAvailable in: Oregon\nWith multiple awards under their belt, Archive Portland boasts a team of growers with over 35 years of collective cannabis growing experience. That dedication to quality trickles down to the buds, where the exceptional indica White Tahoe Cookies takes on a smooth sedative high that keeps us coming back for more.\nLemonder by Seattle’s Private Reserve\nAvailable in: Washington\nWe save Seattle’s Private Reserve flower for special occasions; grown in a facility that is tightly sealed and meticulously controlled, the euphoric hybrid Lemonder has found its way into our stash boxes and smoke circles throughout 2017. SPR’s rigorous testing of all their cannabis products lets us consume with full peace of mind.\nLead image by Nastasic/iStock\n*Editor’s note: Leafly and Marley Natural are owned by the same parent company.
