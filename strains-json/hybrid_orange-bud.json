            "text": "A lot of people think of alcohol as the classic social lubricant. For some of us, it is. Alcohol can loosen us up, make us chatty and animated, and wash away social anxiety. It\u2019s also often readily available at social occasions. Meanwhile, many people avoid cannabis use during social events\u2014for one thing, it\u2019s generally not served, and for another, many can recall a time cannabis made them paranoid or sleepy at a party, and don\u2019t want to have that happen again.\n\nLuckily, with the right strains you can avoid the unwanted effects mentioned above. We used the advanced filters in Leafly\u2019s strain explorer to get started, sorting to include strains with the happiest, most talkative highs, and to exclude any strains that make users anxious, paranoid, or sleepy. (If only alcohol\u2019s drawbacks were so easy to filter out, am I right?)\nWe\u2019ve curated the resultant list with our in-house expertise, vetting all suggestions against our own experiences and ensuring there\u2019s a pick for every type of party. Attendees heading to any social occasion will find something below.\nAnd the awards for the best party cannabis strains go to\u2026\nChocolope\nStrain type: Sativa\nBest for: All occasions.\nDNA Genetics developed Chocolope by crossing\u00a0Chocolate Thai\u00a0with\u00a0Cannalope Haze to create their homage to the super-popular Chocolate strains of the 1980s. The hefty\u00a0sativa\u00a0buds give\u00a0earthy, sweet\u00a0coffee\u00a0flavors that provide a dreamy, cerebral effect. It\u2019s known around the Leafly office as \u201cthe party strain,\u201d and for good reason\u2014it\u2019s basically impossible to be unhappy or introverted with such a feel-good high.\n\nWhite Russian\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Dinner parties.\nOriginally created by Dutch breeders Serious Seeds, White Russian is a cross of two legendary strains,\u00a0White Widow\u00a0and\u00a0AK-47. An indica-dominant hybrid, it won the\u00a0High Times\u00a0Cannabis Cup \u201cBest Overall\u201d\u00a0in 1996. White Russian is an extremely fragrant plant, and with a flavor that is smooth and spicy with undertones of skunk and earth, and its high is quite cerebral (especially for an indica-dominant strain), making it great for conversation with those around you.\nTangie\nStrain type: Sativa\nBest for: Cocktail parties.\nAnother fave among the Leafly crew, particularly for group gatherings after work, Tangie is a fantastic offering from DNA Genetics in Amsterdam. This strain is a remake of sorts of the popular version of\u00a0Tangerine Dream\u00a0that was sought-after in the 1990s, with genetics derived from a cross of\u00a0California Orange\u00a0and a\u00a0Skunk\u00a0hybrid. Its citrus heritage is the most evident in its refreshing tangerine aroma.\nBlue Goo\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Friends and family gatherings.\nBlue Goo is a sativa-dominant hybrid that\u2019s a cross between the famous hybrid\u00a0Blue Dream\u00a0and indica\u00a0Afgoo. A moderate to high potency yields uplifting effects that are standard for sativas, but not excessively energetic thanks to Afgoo\u2019s contribution as well as the mellow nature of Blue Dream. This strain is appropriate for day or nighttime consumption and provides smooth smoke and berry flavor.\n\nSour Lemon OG\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Birthday parties.\nBred by Emerald Triangle Seeds, Sour Lemon OG is a sativa-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0cross between\u00a0California Sour\u00a0and\u00a0Lemon OG. This 65%\u00a0sativa\u00a0strain is named after its aromatic sour smell with recognizable notes of\u00a0lemon,\u00a0lime, and\u00a0apple. Sour Lemon OG elevates the mind and body simultaneously, making this a natural go-to strain for\u00a0celebrations, social engagements, or even just a busy day.\nBlue Diesel\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Happy hour.\nDaughter of indica-dominant\u00a0Blueberry\u00a0and sativa-dominant\u00a0NYC Diesel, Blue Diesel (also known as Blue City Diesel) falls slightly on the indica side of things with a pleasant,\u00a0moderate- to long-lasting body buzz (perfect if you want to extend the happy for more than an hour). Thanks to its Blueberry genetics, this flower emanates a light berry aroma that is smooth, expansive, and fast-acting. This strain is optimal for daytime use, and relaxes the consumer in social settings without putting you to sleep.\nPez\nStrain type: Indica\nBest for: Cannabis-focused parties.\nPez is an\u00a0indica\u00a0daughter of\u00a0Afghani\u00a0and Pakistani strains. These\u00a0sweet, frosty buds offer the\u00a0relaxation\u00a0typical of indicas without the drowsiness, making the strain great for daytime use.\u00a0We recommend this one as a shareable contribution to any 420-friendly gathering\u2014it\u2019s also on our list of the Top 100 Must-Try Strains, meaning it will be a particularly popular addition to any event with open cannabis consumption.\n\nOrange Bud\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Hosting.\nMatching plenty of social energy with a dose of subtle relaxation, this strain is perfect for gatherings where you\u2019re in charge and want to stay upbeat and level-headed. First bred in 1980s by Dutch Passion, Orange Bud is a combination of two members of the 100%\u00a0Skunk\u00a0family. With bright orange hairs coating the surface, it showcases scents of orange and nectarine.\nBlueberry Headband\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Parties you don\u2019t want to attend.\nSeveral renditions of the Blueberry Headband hybrid are known to exist, but the original Blueberry Headband from NorCal\u2019s Emerald Triangle Seeds is the most well-known. It\u2019s a 50/50 indica-sativa hybrid that smells of diesel, berries and pepper, and it produces a perfectly balanced high with a nice cerebral rush and relaxing body effects. This is great for staying sufficiently present while mentally floating high above any social event you wish you didn\u2019t have to attend (think work parties, baby showers, and so on).\nBanana Kush\nStrain type: Hybrid\nBest for: Potlucks.\nThis legendary West Coast strain crosses\u00a0Ghost OG\u00a0and\u00a0Skunk Haze\u00a0to create an\u00a0indica-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that tastes and smells like a bushel of fresh\u00a0bananas (and will whet your appetite if there\u2019s food around). Although it leans towards an\u00a0indica genetically, the effects are balanced by the\u00a0Haze\u2019s\u00a0mellow\u00a0sativa\u00a0buzz that provides a\u00a0relaxed\u00a0sense of\u00a0euphoria.\u00a0Banana Kush also help its consumers remain\u00a0talkative\u00a0in social settings.\n\nDurban Cookies\nStrain type: Sativa\nBest for: Loud parties.\nDurban Cookies is the\u00a0Durban Poison-dominant\u00a0phenotype\u00a0of\u00a0GSC. Known for its invigorating mental energy and body buzz, Durban Cookies offers a more energizing experience, making this sativa-dominant strain a top choice throughout the day and into the evening, particularly if you\u2019re headed to a high-energy event where you\u2019ll be surrounded by music, people, and movement.\nBubblegum Kush\nStrain type: Indica\nBest for: Low-key get-togethers.\nThis strain is for laid-back social situations; it\u2019ll leave you relaxed and comfy on any given couch, but also chatty and ready to hang with whoever sits down next to you. An 80% indica strain from Bulldog Seeds in the Netherlands, Bubblegum Kush is a cross between\u00a0Bubble Gum\u00a0and an undisclosed Kush, and has a satisfyingly sour smell and flavor.\nStrawberry\nStrain type: Sativa\nBest for: Being a plus-one.\nOriginally bred in the Netherlands, Strawberry is a mostly sativa cannabis strain with a pungent fruity scent and uplifting effects. Consumers prone to anxiety choose Strawberry for its stress-relieving qualities without the jarring paranoia common among high-THC strains (which makes it great for small talk with people you don\u2019t know). Comfortable and relaxing, Strawberry brings with it a hearty dose of physical and mental ease.",
