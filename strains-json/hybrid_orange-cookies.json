            "text": "Lots of new strains are waiting for you in the Leafly Explorer, but we'd like to highlight five of our favorite\u00a0newcomers this week. With names based on\u00a0Breaking Bad\u00a0puns and overpriced fashion accessories, maybe a few of these varieties will pique your interest. Already had a chance to test drive one of these fine specimens? Review, review, review. We're dying to know what you thought!\n\u00a0 \u00a01. Dank Schrader\nCharacteristics of Dank Schrader:\n\nDank Schrader is the house strain at\u00a0The Healing Center\u00a0in Vancouver, BC. The strain was developed during the final season of Breaking Bad and is named after DEA Agent Hank Schrader, a character on the show. Dank Schrader crosses\u00a0Rockstar Kush\u00a0with\u00a0Bubba Kush\u00a0to create a potent and\u00a0relaxing\u00a0indica-driven\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that has tested out as high as 27%\u00a0THC\u00a0according to dispensary\u2019s lab results, performed by Hedron Analytical.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Pineapple Purps\nCharacteristics of\u00a0Pineapple Purps:\n\nPineapple Purps is a\u00a0sativa-dominant strain that is rarely found but always cherished by those looking for strains with a high\u00a0THCV\u00a0cannabinoid profile. THCV, a compound known to block\u00a0panic attacks, reduce\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s\u00a0tremors, and suppress the appetite, is typically only found in trace amounts in most cannabis, but Pineapple Purps is a special variety that can express a THC:THCV ratio of 3:1. This strain is highly psychoactive and\u00a0energetic, but its effects generally won\u2019t last as long as low-THCV varieties.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Gucci OG\nCharacteristics of\u00a0Gucci OG:\n\nGucci OG is an\u00a0OG Kush\u00a0variant named with the lavish cannabis connoisseur in mind. Hailing from southern California like so many of its OG relatives, Gucci OG takes on the family\u2019s signature aroma of\u00a0pine\u00a0and\u00a0lemon, but with a unique hint of\u00a0sweet\u00a0berry. This hybrid\u2019s effect can vary with different doses; small amounts may provide a spark of\u00a0energy\u00a0and\u00a0creativity, while larger doses tend to give way to heavy\u00a0sedation\u00a0or dizzying\u00a0euphoria.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a04. White Fire 43\nCharacteristics of\u00a0White Fire 43:\n\nWhite Fire 43 is a select\u00a0phenotype\u00a0of\u00a0White Fire OG\u00a0grown by\u00a0TLC Collective\u00a0in Los Angeles, CA. Number 43 was the standout phenotype in a lot of over 500 White Fire OG seeds, originally bred by OG Raskal. White Fire 43 is known for its exceptional\u00a0cannabinoid\u00a0production, with claims of test results regularly nearing 30%. The strong medicinal and\u00a0pain-fighting effects are ushered in with a\u00a0pungent\u00a0earthy\u00a0aroma that is amplified by flavors of\u00a0lemons\u00a0and sour\u00a0citrus. White Fire 43 is an\u00a0indica-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that is great before bedtime, helping you\u00a0relax,\u00a0decompress, and find\u00a0sleep.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Orange Cookies\nCharacteristics of\u00a0Orange Cookies:\n\nOrange Cookies bred by Franchise Genetics is a\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that combines\u00a0Orange Juice\u00a0with the renowned\u00a0GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies). A flavor-packed strain, Orange Cookies expresses itself with a strong aroma of\u00a0sweet\u00a0citrus\u00a0that closely resembles a fresh tangerine. The flavors of Orange Cookies gives way to deep calming body effects that mingle with a\u00a0euphoric\u00a0cerebral buzz to leave you\u00a0happy\u00a0and\u00a0relaxed.",

            "text": "Although my dealer dubbed the strain \"Alien Orange Cookies\" I found it appropriate to write my review under \"Orange Cookies\" as leafly did not have \"Alien.\" \nMy bud (no pun intended) and I rolled two J's, one for each of us. After the third hit I instantly felt insanely relaxed. By the time I finished the joint I was the happiest person there could be. \nEverything I saw made me happy and made me delve into life and how amazing everything is that was created or came to be. \nI felt so connected with life and appreciative of every little thing. I was so thankful for my life and I feel that this feeling of heart stuck with me even after I came down. \n\nThis strain changed my life!\n\nI think this strain changed the way I analyze life. I think about what is going on before I do anything. And I learned to be thankful and amazed and appreciative of everything in life. From moist banana bread to other delicious food (of course) to how a television works. \n\nWould definitely recommend to a stressed out parent.\n \nIf I could rate this strain 100 stars, I'd give it 1,000,000.",
