            "text": "Leafly's strain database was just updated with some new varieties. Have you had a chance to check out Snoop Dogg's newest line of cannabis strains? Read about those and more below. Also, remember to submit a review if you've tried any of these newly added strains!\n\u00a0\n 1. Orange Creamsicle\n\nTaking the best attributes of parent strains Orange Crush and Juicy Fruit, Orange Creamsicle\u2019s tall structure, heavy colas, and pungent flavor will be sure to keep you coming back for more. This hybrid strain, as the name suggests, has a strong citrus flavor and is used to treat nausea and anxiety. Growers will be happy with this heavy producer that flowers in 9 weeks with beautiful orange-white coloring and a thick coating of resin.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Orange Creamsicle\n\u00a0\n 2. 3D CBD\n\n3D CBD from Snoop Dogg\u2019s branded line of cannabis strains was crafted with patients in mind. With a THC:CBD ratio of about 5:8, this earthy-flavored sativa is preferred for treating pain, inflammation, and muscle tension. Consumers susceptible to THC-induced anxiety may also appreciate the sobering, relaxing balance CBD has to offer.\n\n3D CBD is currently available at LivWell on Broadway in Denver, CO\n\u00a0\n 3. Purple Bush\n\nPurple Bush, brought to you by Leafs by Snoop, is an indica-dominant hybrid that carries all the hallmark traits of a kush with a hint of berry flavor. This dense purple-hued strain tests upward of 21% THC and will have you feeling relaxed after a long day.\n\nPurple Bush is currently available at LivWell on Broadway in Denver, CO\n\u00a0\n 4. Bluniverse\n\nBluniverse, also called Blue Universe, is a 50/50 hybrid strain bred by Dynasty Seeds. Mothered by Blue Magoo and fathered by Ms. Universe, Bluniverse inherits a complex flavor profile of blueberry, cherry, and vanilla spice. Its initial effects focus themselves cerebrally, with high-flying euphoria that tapers into pacifying relaxation over time. This hybrid may express one of three different phenotypes, one that takes after Blue Magoo, another taking after Ms. Universe, and a third that exhibits a balance of each parent\u2019s characteristics.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Bluniverse\n\u00a0\n 5. Tangerine Man\n\nFrom Leafs by Snoop comes Tangerine Man, a sativa-dominant hybrid that is perhaps the best of his new strains. With a citrus aroma and trichome-coated buds, expect a nice pick-me-up that pairs wonderfully with daytime physical activity.\n\nTangerine Man is currently available at LivWell on Broadway in Denver, CO\n\u00a0\n 6. Gooberry\n\nGooberry is an indica-dominant strain descended from legendary parents Afgoo and Blueberry. This fruity, spicy strain will leave you giggling on your couch with upward of 20% THC. Consumers highly recommend this strain for night time use to treat pain and insomnia, and it's sure to leave you with the munchies. Like most indicas, Gooberry will flower in 7-9 weeks with a short, bushy structure.\n\nGooberry is currently available at Orange County Cannabis Club in Santa Ana, CA\n\u00a0\n 7. ICED Grapefruit\n\nICED Grapefruit by Female Seeds is a hybrid strain that brings together genetics from ICE and Grapefruit. The resulting hybrid leans slightly to the sativa side, offering uplifting and happy effects that keep positivity flowing. The physically relaxing qualities of this strain come from its ICE parent, an indica-dominant hybrid cherished for its sedating effects. Both parents come through in the flavor as hashy notes intermix with sweet citrus and fruit.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying ICED Grapefruit\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",

Bright yellow and green buds covered in orange hairs and white trichs, and ooozing and delicious floral creamy orange smell that even non weed smokers love(no lies). The taste its just as appealing, leaving you with dead on imaitation of an orange creamsicle on every exhale. The high is a very mellow relaxing high. Not overly powerful, but not unpotent. Its just very mellowing. ",
