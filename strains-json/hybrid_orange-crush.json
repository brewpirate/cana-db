            "text": "For every color in the rainbow there is a complementing strain ready to match each individual\u2019s absolute favorite hue. Only drink out of blue cups? Wear a lot of purple?\u00a0 Refuse to eat something that isn\u2019t orange-tinted? Pair your number one color with a little bit of green! Below we list a strain pairing that goes hand in hand with each letter in ROYGBIV.\nRed\n\nFiery, passionate, sensual \u2013 red is a power color that tends to\u00a0allure the sexes and could\u00a0possibly give you a promotion. Pair this magnetic color with the \u201cspeedy and intense\u201d Panama Red, a full sativa that will match that flash of red lipstick or vibrant watch band.\nOrange\n\nThis warm and fizzy hue can only pair best with a warm and fizzy strain. Enter Orange Crush \u2013 its sweet and tangy flavor perfectly complements its twin color.\nYellow\n\nIn the dead of winter, yellow reminisces sunny days and lemonade. Try Lemon Haze to melt the frost \u2013 it\u2019s a citrusy sativa whose buds appear green and yellow. The\u00a0lemony taste will bring back your sunny disposition through these chilly months.\nGreen\n\nWith 2017\u2019s color of the year being \u201cgreenery,\u201d the hybrid Green Dream is an excellent addition to any green stash.\nBlue\n\nBlue has always been a fan favorite and possibly the most popular color of the rainbow \u2013 it\u2019s calming, tranquil, and makes one think of the sky and the sea. The hybrid ArcticBlue\u00a0pairs well with this peaceful color and\u00a0its anti-anxiety effects.\nHonorable mention goes to the hybrid\u00a0Blue Dream, a strain that has become just as popular as the color itself.\nIndigo\n\nIndigo is the in-between of purple and blue \u2013 a deep, gorgeous hue that can only be complemented by the hybrid strain Blurple. It\u2019s the best mix of Blue Dream and Mendocino Purps, just as indigo is the best mix of purple and blue, aka \u201cblurple.\u201d\nViolet\n\nA color that\u00a0received its name from the violet flower, it\u2019s only logical to pair this beautiful hue with the hybrid strain Violet Delight. It releases a strong floral flavor that will\u00a0have you dreaming in shades of purple.\nIf your favorite color is outside of the rainbow spectrum, we have a couple of honorary mentions for you to pick up.\n\nPink\n\nThough pink is not technically a color of the rainbow, we couldn\u2019t leave out this bubblegum pop favorite. Pair that Pepto-Bismol toned jacket that\u2019s been collecting dust in your closet with the sweet and fruity indica Pink Berry.\nBlack\n\nFor those who live and breathe in\u00a0waves of black, don\u2019t pass up the indica Black Domina. It\u2019s a strain designed for late night,\u00a0so\u00a0grab your best black pajamas, black slippers, black robe, and pull in this heavy strain deep into the night.",

            "text": "To make a truly informed cannabis-buying decision, you have to smell the product. And I don\u2019t mean taking a dainty whiff. You\u2019ve got get in there and really inhale, because smelling it \u2014 really focusing on the fragrance \u2014 may just be the best way to choose your cannabis.\n\u201cDepending on what the scent is, it can make or break a strain for people,\u201d said Tyson Dieter, a manager at the Southwest Portland outlet of Nectar, an Oregon cannabis retailer.\nI\u2019m a home perfumer trained by a world-class nose. Years ago I trained at home using natural perfumer Mandy Aftel\u2019s workbooks, and later I studied with her at her studio in Berkeley, Calif. For me scent is the ultimate in pleasure experiences. On a recent Tuesday morning, I stopped in at Nectar to talk scent and learn about the role it plays in the burgeoning cannabis industry.\nWhat Do Cannabis and Perfumes Have in Common?\nIt turns out perfume and pot have a lot in common.\nBoth products come with outlandish, sometimes arbitrary titles. Burberry Weekend, meet Blackberry Kush. Practically no one buys the product without smelling it first. (Where it\u2019s allowed, that is. In Washington state, pre-purchase smelling for recreational cannabis is against the law.) We don\u2019t talk about them using the same language, although that\u2019s changing as consumers learn more about scent\u2019s connection to the cannabis experience.\n\nAs I stepped through Nectar\u2019s front door, the first thing I noticed was the air, which smelled lightly of sweet herb. The employees \u2014 perhaps the happiest service professionals I\u2019ve ever encountered \u2014 were all eager to talk to me about their favorite-smelling strains.\nCommercial perfumes are composed of top notes, middle notes (also called heart notes) and base notes, so named based on their relative evaporation rates. A perfume with a top note of essential oil of bergamot (citrus) might be paired with a middle note of lavender oil and a base note of thick, resiny oakmoss. Together they make up the full scent experience of the perfume.\nIn the cannabis world, the language hasn\u2019t yet evolved to describe the plant\u2019s fragrance notes with such specificity. But budtenders and growers are expanding their vocabulary to describe the scent experience. So you may see two main, often contrasting odors: sweet and fruity paired with earthy, like in an Afgooey.\nAt Nectar the jars open dozens of times a day for olfactory sampling. Some strains are more fragrant than others. A Blackberry Kush may not remind anyone of blackberries, but it does have a subtle sweetness to balance the hashy, diesel-fume center it\u2019s known for. GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), another potent strain, smells oily and pungent in the middle and slightly sweet on top.\nAll cannabis strains carry their own scent signature, a fact that often surprises cannabis consumers who come to a shop for the first time.\n\n\u201cFirst-timers generally know about THC content and little else,\u201d Dieter said. \u201cBut then they usually stand there smelling all day to find a perfect match.\u201d\nSome strains share some of their scent identity with the world of aromatherapy. An activating hybrid sativa like Orange Crush has much in common with a bitter orange essential oil \u2014 one often used by aromatherapists for energizing. In the same vein, the citrus-scented J1, a sativa hybrid, smells like a traditional foug\u00e8re-style perfume, opening with a citrus note and moving into an herby heart.\nBecause scent is deeply personal, no one really agrees on which strains smell best. A savory, cheesy strain like OG99 might send some running for the hills, but for consumers who like to \u201csmoke savory,\u201d the associated mellow vibe is well worth it.\nOther consumers prefer the so-called \u201cauthentic-smelling\u201d pot strains. For them, something like The Perps, which gives off the odor of a grape Jolly Rancher, might feel like spraying your face with Britney Spears\u2019 Curious.\nWhy Consumption Methods Matter When It Comes to Scent Preservation\nWhen it comes to harnessing the scent of cannabis, consumption methods matter.\n\nA cannabis flower\u2019s scent comes directly from its terpenes, volatile aromatic organic compounds found in the oils of all flowers. Terpenes in the cannabis flower evolved to attract pollinators or repel enemies. More than 100 possible terpenes are thought to exist in various strains of the cannabis flower.\nThe unique combination of terpenes in a particular strain produces its aromatic properties and, some believe, is thought to influence the body\u2019s high. To heighten the experience of the terpenes, therefore, consumers should reach for consumption methods involving less combustion. The higher the burn temperature, the more likely the most volatile and aromatic terpenes will combust before being consumed.\nIn other words, to get the full scent experience, vape it, don\u2019t smoke it.\n\u201cWhen you have a vaping machine, it can hinder the effect of the flavor,\u201d said Myles Hyde, a budtender at Nectar who specializes in medicinal use. For flower, Hyde suggested using a vaporizer in at least the $250 range. \u201cWith a lower-quality machine, you may end up smelling some of the machine itself.\u201d\n\nThose who do want to smoke it would be advised to do it indoors, according to Hyde, where the scent lingers, affecting the high.\nOther methods, like using hash oil, produces a concentrated scent experience so aromatic it feels like smelling an aged perfume. Dieter pulled a Dogwalker resin with a smell reminiscent of jasmine concentrate: dirty, floral, even slightly fecal. In this way, fragrance obsessives are much like cheese hounds or any other aficionados who move with passion into a sensual pursuit \u2014 as they explore their olfactory world, they become more and more enamored with scents that might repel the layperson.\nEmphasizing Fragrance as Part of the Purchasing Decision\nThe importance of scent is beginning to take on a bigger role in the purchasing decision at some of Portland\u2019s leading retail shops. During a recent visit to Oregon\u2019s Finest, a store tucked into the city\u2019s swanky Pearl District, manager Selena Toomey pulled flower-filled apothecary jars off a shelf for me.\n\u201cStrains sell themselves based on their scent,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cIt makes a huge difference in the experience.\u201d\n\nPerfumers are taught to smell coffee beans between samples in order to cleanse their palates. Oregon\u2019s Finest has adapted the practice for the cannabis connoisseur. Toomey invited me to sniff single-origin beans (this is Portland, after all) while passing between strain jars.\nToomey often suggests patients spend up to 10 minutes working the flower in their hands before smoking or vaping it. Doing so, she said, allows you to smell more of the terpenes and enhance the way it tastes when consumed.\n\u201cThe terpenoids and flavonoids play a huge part in opening up your receptors to all of the effects of the cannabis,\u201d Toomey explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like steaming in a hot shower before you moisturize.\u201d\nScent scientists often talk about the cognitive barriers to talking about our often ignored fifth sense \u2014 that we don\u2019t really practice the language needed to really discuss scent.\n\nWhen Toomey talks about scent to her customers, she sometimes avoids scent talk and focuses on taste, which offers a vocabulary more familiar to most consumers. She\u2019ll speak of a strain like Dutch Treat as being like \u201cmint chocolate chip ice cream.\u201d\nToomey has been at Oregon\u2019s Finest since its 2014 opening. She\u2019s seen her customer base grow from curiosity to connoisseurship, even as the shop retains its focus on pot\u2019s medicinal effects.\nShe sells individual terpenes as an additive to other marijuana products for medicinal users. Once you have enough experience to identify specific terpenes by smell alone, you can anticipate the associated high, she said.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m in a dispensary, I can tell by the aroma if a strain will work with my body,\u201d Toomey added. \u201cThe nose knows.\u201d\nEmily Grosvenor is a writer and perfumer based in Oregon.

The high was very exciting for my mind which made me laugh at the slightest out-of-place comments and at the same time was making my head heavy. I also note that I had the halo-head affect which is great. All in all, its a very conversational friendly high which stimulates the brain and at the end of the day puts you sound to sleep.

It wasn\u2019t a great looking batch but the price was right. The smoke was mild in my mouth and it made my tongue tingle. Kind of the way it does when you eat citrus fruit. I enjoyed the light sweet scent it left in the air. I\u2019ve been struggling with a lack of energy and fibro fog so I thought I\u2019d give Orange Crush (Orange Cali X Blueberry) a go first thing in the morning. Whenever I\u2019m trying a new cannabis strain for the first time, I always start off with a little because I have no idea how it\u2019s going to affect me. Turns out, a little nug in a bong was just right for starting my day.  It took a few minutes but before I knew it my energy had picked up slightly and my mood sky rocketed.  I was feeling uplifted, brainy, and happy. And, I realized that I was totally stress free. I didn\u2019t experience any bad side effects, not even dry mouth. I\u2019m surprised at how long the effects lasted from such a small amount. Can\u2019t wait to try a better batch of Orange Crush, pretty sure it\u2019ll be a five.",
