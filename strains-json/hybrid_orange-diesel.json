            "text": "Our five newest varieties bring the Leafly Explorer to the cusp of 800 strains, and it\u2019s times like these we realize that building this database is an endless endeavor. Indica enthusiasts will love 8 Ball Kush, a 100% indica strain descended from a native Afghani landrace strain. Hell\u2019s OG (f.k.a. Hell\u2019s Angel OG) is an indica-dominant hybrid rumored to originate in the gardens of the ol\u2019 Red & Whites themselves.
