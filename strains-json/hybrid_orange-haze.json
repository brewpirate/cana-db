This strain is very potent. It has an aroma of citrus and cat urine/ammonia. Very high odor, even in my top dresser drawer the entire second floor reeked of bud. Glass vials a must when transporting or storing. Fast acting strain, was completely stoned within a few minutes. Main effect is a serious case of the tinglies. A very pleasant experience. However, be careful to see where one hit will take you before trying more. This strain is VERY expansive in the lungs. Three people I was smoking with threw up from coughing so deeply. Take less than you think you\u0027ll be able to handle, it kicks you while it\u0027s in there. Overall a wonderful strain I will be sure to revisit. Just gotta remember to take it easy, one toke over the line would have me in a bud coma.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1605719,"username":"fredftb420","text":"Good taste and you would pass a great high time with it","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3619","title":"Which Cannabis Strain Pairs Best With Your Zodiac Sign?","author":"Lisa Rough","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1445788800000)\/","text":"Some people take astrology more seriously than others, but regardless of your level of obsession with all things zodiac, you at least know your star sign.
