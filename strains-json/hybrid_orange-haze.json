            "text": "One bong rip had me good an on my ass for about two hours. This strain is very potent. It has an aroma of citrus and cat urine/ammonia. Very high odor, even in my top dresser drawer the entire second floor reeked of bud. Glass vials a must when transporting or storing. Fast acting strain, was completely stoned within a few minutes. Main effect is a serious case of the tinglies. A very pleasant experience. However, be careful to see where one hit will take you before trying more. This strain is VERY expansive in the lungs. Three people I was smoking with threw up from coughing so deeply. Take less than you think you'll be able to handle, it kicks you while it's in there. Overall a wonderful strain I will be sure to revisit. Just gotta remember to take it easy, one toke over the line would have me in a bud coma.",
