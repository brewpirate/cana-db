Lower temperatures on your nail or banger allow for a more dialed-in dabbing experience and maximize the flavor of the hash or concentrate you drop on your nail.

To help explain the value and function of a carb cap, I‚Äôll breakdown what they are, how I like to use them, and why you should use them, too.\nBrowse Dab Tools \u0026 Accessories\nWhat Is a Carb Cap?\nA carb cap is a fairly rudimentary dabbing accessory that is essentially imperative to an enjoyable, low-temp dab. There are many designs and styles of carb caps, but the principles and purpose remain the same: they‚Äôre small tools that are usually made of glass, titanium, or another stable, heat-resistant material. Carb caps are used to cover the top of your nail or banger once you‚Äôve dropped your dab onto it. They help trap the heat and emphasize true convection as your hash vaporizes.\n\nIf you‚Äôre wondering how carb caps got their name, it‚Äôs because they add or regulate air to your dabbing surface (much like a carb on a bong or pipe, or a carburetor under the hood of your car). Place one on top of your nail to cap it, locking in the heat and restricting the air flow. Many carb cap designs include an airway that allows for a jet stream of fresh air to be pulled through and help agitate the hot oils, spreading them around the dabbing surface and vaporizing the dab more efficiently.\nWhy Use Carb Caps?\n\n\n\n\n\n Sunday vibes‚Ä¶ . . . #aviddabber #Seattle #leafly #dab #dabs #cannabis #dabbing #dablife #dabstagram #shatter #dailydabbers #dabbersdaily #bho #sho #weshouldsmoke #highsociety #stayhigh #concentrates #710 #420 #710community #enail #dailydriver #mininail üì∏ @juliasumpter\nA post shared by  The Avid Dabber (@the.avid.dabber) on Dec 24, 2017 at 3:43pm PST\n\n\n\nThe simple answer to why you should use a carb cap is to modify airflow to your nail while increasing flavor and efficiency. Carb caps allow you to dab at lower temperatures and help trap the heat of your nail, retaining heat for a longer period and extending the sweet spot or target for your preferred temperature.\n\nBy restricting the air flow to your dab, a functional carb cap drops the air pressure throughout your rig, including on the dabbing surface itself. Lowering the pressure means the boiling point for your oil drops and takes less heat to create a creamy, thick vapor quality with each dab.\nHow to Use a Carb Cap\n\n\n\n\n\n Rig: @EchelonGlass üåäüíé Nail: @Toro_Glass 30mm Grail Cap: @Barry.Glass  Terps: @Exclusi Kosher Dawg Sauce üî• What are you dabbing on tonight?  #TLTH\nA post shared by  Too Loud (@tooloudtohear) on Jan 22, 2018 at 7:14pm PST\n\n\n\nUsing a carb cap is simple. After you‚Äôve applied your dab to the hot nail surface, simply cover the nail or banger with the carb cap to trap the heat and modify the air pressure. Once capped, you can tap the cap, lifting it up and down to adjust the airflow and pressure. Or, if you have a functional carb cap, you can spin or twirl the cap around the crown of your nail to push the jet stream of air around, swirling and spreading the oils around the hot dabbing surface. When you‚Äôre ready to clear the plume of vapor, simply remove the carb to clear your rig.\nExplore Dabbing Tools \u0026 Accessories\nAvid Dab of the Week\n\n\n\n\n\n Saturdays are for Live Resin. . . .

Try These 10 Cannabis Strains to Help Induce Hunger","author":"Lisa Rough","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1441900800000)\/","text":"For some cannabis consumers, the ‚Äúmunchies,‚Äù or appetite stimulation, is an unwanted side effect that can lead to overeating, but for many medical marijuana patients, it provides necessary relief from symptoms like nausea and a lack of appetite. For those of you who consume cannabis as a natural appetite stimulant or to help calm gastrointestinal distress, here are 10 of the many strain varieties that can help kick-start the grumbles in your tummy:\n Goo\nGoo is a fairly heavy indica, so don‚Äôt test this strain unless you‚Äôre prepared for a strong dose of relaxation with your appetite boost. It also offers relief from painful muscle spasms, making it a good choice for spasticity or for those who suffer from gastrointestinal disorders.\n Monster Cookies\nAnother potent indica, Monster Cookies hails from the favored GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) tribe and offers the same dose of euphoria and relaxation you know and love. The sleepy effects will increase over time, so keep your couch and your munchies close at hand and you‚Äôll be set for the night.\n Maui Bubble Gift\nMaui Bubble Gift is an aromatic hybrid with roots in three distinctively fantastic medicinal strains: Bubble Gum, Maui Waui and God‚Äôs Gift. This indica-dominant strain has an unusually high CBD content, which makes it an excellent choice for pain and nausea sufferers. With the mental clarity of Maui Waui, the stomach-soothing spasm relief of Bubble Gum, and the relaxing effects of God‚Äôs Gift, this hybrid offers the best of three worlds in one.\n Sonoma Coma\nSonoma Coma is a rare sativa that hails from (where else?) Sonoma County, California. It offers energetic, uplifting effects with a mellow finish and a dash of the munchies to aid a diminished appetite.\n Platinum Purple Kush\nPurple Kush‚Äôs beefed-up older brother, Platinum Purple Kush provides deep muscle relaxation while still maintaining clarity and focus, making it one of the ‚Äúlighter‚Äù indicas on our list. It has been known to make consumers ‚Äúcrazy hungry,‚Äù so make sure to have some noms on hand.\n Orange Skunk\nA citrus infusion with a clear-headed high, Orange Skunk relieves depression and anxiety in addition to a lack of appetite. With a myriad of effects, this strain can help relieve multiple symptoms, including inflammation, headaches, even pain and fibromyalgia.\n Gigabud\nThis indica-dominant hybrid is known to be expressly excellent for inducing an appetite, even among those with the most intense stomach symptoms. For those with nausea, weight loss, and issues with the digestive tract, Gigabud ought to be a staple for relief and to encourage a ‚Äúravenous‚Äù appetite.\n Caramelo\nThis sativa-dominant hybrid has indica origins in the Lavender family, offering an uplifting buzz without paranoia, along with potent pain and nausea relief. While Caramelo is an energetic strain useful for daytime consumption, be forewarned: the effects may be short-lived, so you may require a stronger strain for longtime symptom management.\n Pure Kush\nTrue to its name, Pure Kush is one of the purest, most potent indicas you‚Äôll encounter. Watch out because this strain will knock you out like Mike Tyson if you‚Äôre not careful. Place your pizza orders before you dose or you may have trouble peeling yourself up off the couch to even get to the kitchen, which just seems‚Ä¶.so far away‚Ä¶.\n Diablo\nContrary to its name, this devilish strain is a kinder, gentler indica than many on this list. While couchlock is still a potential side effect, Diablo will allow you the focus and mental capacity to tackle day-to-day life without too much trouble, although you may need to watch out for a case of the giggles.\nStill looking for an appetite stimulant?

The sleepy effects will increase over time, so keep your couch and your munchies close at hand and you‚Äôll be set for the night.\n Maui Bubble Gift\nMaui Bubble Gift is an aromatic hybrid with roots in three distinctively fantastic medicinal strains: Bubble Gum, Maui Waui and God‚Äôs Gift. This indica-dominant strain has an unusually high CBD content, which makes it an excellent choice for pain and nausea sufferers. With the mental clarity of Maui Waui, the stomach-soothing spasm relief of Bubble Gum, and the relaxing effects of God‚Äôs Gift, this hybrid offers the best of three worlds in one.\n Sonoma Coma\nSonoma Coma is a rare sativa that hails from (where else?) Sonoma County, California. It offers energetic, uplifting effects with a mellow finish and a dash of the munchies to aid a diminished appetite.\n Platinum Purple Kush\nPurple Kush‚Äôs beefed-up older brother, Platinum Purple Kush provides deep muscle relaxation while still maintaining clarity and focus, making it one of the ‚Äúlighter‚Äù indicas on our list. It has been known to make consumers ‚Äúcrazy hungry,‚Äù so make sure to have some noms on hand.\n Orange Skunk\nA citrus infusion with a clear-headed high, Orange Skunk relieves depression and anxiety in addition to a lack of appetite. With a myriad of effects, this strain can help relieve multiple symptoms, including inflammation, headaches, even pain and fibromyalgia.\n Gigabud\nThis indica-dominant hybrid is known to be expressly excellent for inducing an appetite, even among those with the most intense stomach symptoms. For those with nausea, weight loss, and issues with the digestive tract, Gigabud ought to be a staple for relief and to encourage a ‚Äúravenous‚Äù appetite.\n Caramelo\nThis sativa-dominant hybrid has indica origins in the Lavender family, offering an uplifting buzz without paranoia, along with potent pain and nausea relief. While Caramelo is an energetic strain useful for daytime consumption, be forewarned: the effects may be short-lived, so you may require a stronger strain for longtime symptom management.\n Pure Kush\nTrue to its name, Pure Kush is one of the purest, most potent indicas you‚Äôll encounter. Watch out because this strain will knock you out like Mike Tyson if you‚Äôre not careful. Place your pizza orders before you dose or you may have trouble peeling yourself up off the couch to even get to the kitchen, which just seems‚Ä¶.so far away‚Ä¶.\n Diablo\nContrary to its name, this devilish strain is a kinder, gentler indica than many on this list. While couchlock is still a potential side effect, Diablo will allow you the focus and mental capacity to tackle day-to-day life without too much trouble, although you may need to watch out for a case of the giggles.\nStill looking for an appetite stimulant?

Lower temperatures on your nail or banger allow for a more dialed-in dabbing experience and maximize the flavor of the hash or concentrate you drop on your nail. Most informed dabbers have evolved their methods beyond heating the nail until it‚Äôs flushed with a red glow, then scorching away the vibrant terpenes. Instead, they‚Äôve expounded their admiration for the carb cap.\nIn my opinion,¬†a good dab doesn‚Äôt really start until you cap it. To help explain the value and function of a carb cap, I‚Äôll breakdown what they are, how I like to use them, and why you should use them, too.\nBrowse Dab Tools \u0026 Accessories\nWhat Is a Carb Cap?\nA carb cap is a fairly rudimentary dabbing accessory that is essentially imperative to an enjoyable, low-temp dab. There are many designs and styles of carb caps, but the principles and purpose remain the same: they‚Äôre small tools that are usually made of glass, titanium, or another stable, heat-resistant material. Carb caps are used to cover the top of your nail or banger once you‚Äôve dropped your dab onto it. They help trap the heat and emphasize true convection as your hash vaporizes.\n\nIf you‚Äôre wondering how carb caps got their name, it‚Äôs because they add or regulate air to your dabbing surface (much like a carb on a bong or pipe, or a carburetor under the hood of your car). Place one on top of your nail to cap it, locking in the heat and restricting the air flow. Many carb cap designs include an airway that allows for a jet stream of fresh air to be pulled through and help agitate the hot oils, spreading them around the dabbing surface and vaporizing the dab more efficiently.\nWhy Use Carb Caps?\n\n\n\n\n\n Sunday vibes‚Ä¶ . . . #aviddabber #Seattle #leafly #dab #dabs #cannabis #dabbing #dablife #dabstagram #shatter #dailydabbers #dabbersdaily #bho #sho #weshouldsmoke #highsociety #stayhigh #concentrates #710 #420 #710community #enail #dailydriver #mininail üì∏ @juliasumpter\nA post shared by  The Avid Dabber (@the.avid.dabber) on Dec 24, 2017 at 3:43pm PST\n\n\n\nThe simple answer to why you should use a carb cap is to modify airflow to your nail while increasing flavor and efficiency. Carb caps allow you to dab at lower temperatures and help trap the heat of your nail, retaining heat for a longer period and extending the sweet spot or target for your preferred temperature.\n\nBy restricting the air flow to your dab, a functional carb cap drops the air pressure throughout your rig, including on the dabbing surface itself. Lowering the pressure means the boiling point for your oil drops and takes less heat to create a creamy, thick vapor quality with each dab.\nHow to Use a Carb Cap\n\n\n\n\n\n Rig: @EchelonGlass üåäüíé Nail: @Toro_Glass 30mm Grail Cap: @Barry.Glass  Terps: @Exclusi Kosher Dawg Sauce üî• What are you dabbing on tonight?  #TLTH\nA post shared by  Too Loud (@tooloudtohear) on Jan 22, 2018 at 7:14pm PST\n\n\n\nUsing a carb cap is simple. After you‚Äôve applied your dab to the hot nail surface, simply cover the nail or banger with the carb cap to trap the heat and modify the air pressure. Once capped, you can tap the cap, lifting it up and down to adjust the airflow and pressure. Or, if you have a functional carb cap, you can spin or twirl the cap around the crown of your nail to push the jet stream of air around, swirling and spreading the oils around the hot dabbing surface. When you‚Äôre ready to clear the plume of vapor, simply remove the carb to clear your rig.\nExplore Dabbing Tools \u0026 Accessories\nAvid Dab of the Week\n\n\n\n\n\n Saturdays are for Live Resin. . . .
