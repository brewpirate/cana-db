The bud itself was beautiful and dense, full of frosty trichomes and pretty orange calyxes. The flavor off the first pull was really sweet, and on exhale I tasted a pleasant little burst of diesel. I smoked a few bowls, picked up my guitar and found myself on the couch still practicing scales two hours later. The wind-down wasn't bad either, not too sleepy as I was still able to finish out the rest of the stuff I had planned for the day. Great strain!",
