            "text": "Really nice strain original burst of energy gives way to a nice relaxing body high while still being quite euphoric. The buds are beautiful very dense absolutely covered in trychs. The flavor is kinda sweet and spicy with quite a bit of earthiness thrown in. I really like this strain after work cuz if you smoke a bit too much you won't be getting any work done. Definitely recommend I know Phat Panda sells it under the name Fuck Yeah which seems like a pretty good description.",

            "text": "The P-91 strain, or \u201cFuck Yeah\u201d by Phat Panda really exceeded my expectations. I got it in a preroll so I can\u2019t say much about the physical appearance, however smoking this flower really blew me away. It\u2019s a very smooth smoking strain with a very fruity flavor. As some others have mentioned in the reviews, I thought it tasted almost exactly like the \u201cFruity Pebbles\u201d cereal. For someone like me that works in a rather high stress environment, this strain was the perfect way for me to relax and unwind both mentally and physically after a long day. ",
