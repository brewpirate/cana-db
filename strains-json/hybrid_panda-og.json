Alien Abduction\n\nAlien Abduction is an OG Kush hybrid bred by So-Cal medical collective Ocean Grown Genetics, who crossed an Alien OG male with the Ether cut of Alien Dawg.

For many patients, Alien Abduction is a great appetite stimulant and sleep aid.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Alien Abduction\n \n  2. Hurricane\n\nHurricane is a 70/30 sativa-dominant hybrid from Colorado breeders Reserva Privada that combines the spicy Haze genetics of Panama Punch with the OG Kush flavors of the award-winning LA Confidential.

Black Cherry Cheesecake leaves users relatively clear-headed while providing strong, sedating body sensations that can make motivation difficult.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Black Cherry Cheesecake\n \n  5. Blaze\n\nBritish Columbia Seed Company crossed the indica Blueberry with Haze in order to tame this lanky, long-flowering Blaze. This large sativa-dominant plant combines the soaring cerebral high and sweet-spicy smell of Haze, while getting shorter flowering times and a distinct dried-grape aroma from Blueberry. Blaze is closely related to Blueberry Haze and Blue Dream.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Blaze\n \n  6.
