I have never before smoked any weed that completely and totally killed all my pain.  Ever. I know a lady who recently had her foot amputated and she had me bringing her this strain saying it was the only thing that helped the pain.  The pain relief only lasts about an hour or so, but it kills all pain better than any opiate I\u0027ve ever encountered.  \n\nNow as for the high... If I smoke only a little, it gets my creativity flowing and energizes me.   If I smoke a whole blunt, it gives me a complete head and body high often ending in couch lock.   It\u0027s not a bad feeling though.  \n\nAs far as growing goes, this strain is not for amateurs.  Phantom Cookies takes its time and seems to flower an exceptionally long time.    My flowered 10 weeks before harvest and honestly I could have gone another week.   Pay close attention to the trichomes at the end of flower.    You don\u0027t want too many amber colored.   About 30% Amber and the rest a milky color is best.    This strain grows very tall so indoor growers may want to scrog their buds.  \n\nBeautiful strain, it is well worth the wait on the buds and the patience and skill it takes to grow.

Maybe 75% Sativa and 25% indica effects.  As an anxious dude I avoid Sativas, and this hybrid has been the best day time strain for me. No anxiety or shakes, just a bright, relaxing high with a gentle body buzz. Potent stuff, got a good high from less than a bowl with medium tolerance. Has a great, strong fresh lemony flavor. Vapes super smooth, no coughing. All in all highly recommended.
