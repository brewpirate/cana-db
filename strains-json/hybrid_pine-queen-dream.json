            "text": "This hybrid is one to keep an eye out for. The flower bt Green Acres Pharms is the perfect summer flower.  The uplift on the front end is fantastic. I'm usually an indican person my self. Yet I find this is a great daytime smoke . The balance of body and head high is great for a BBQ or anytime in the sun.\n\nBudtender notes: \nNot too much dry mouth.\n\nBut a great pairing with your smoke would be a citrus IPA or a fresh hop beer.\n\nThe terp profiles in the flower and hops will complement one another.\n\n\nsorry everyone for the lack of post... busy travling and budtending . \nThanks for staying tuned!",
