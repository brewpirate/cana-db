Though mostly indica, Romulan growers insist sativa genetics have crept in over time, lending it intense cerebral effects. These squat, pine-scented plants produce dense frosty buds that have found their following among connoisseurs in B.C. and the Pacific Northwest.\nKing’s Bread\n\nSaid to be a sativa landrace from the Blue Mountains of Jamaica, King’s Bread (or King’s Breath) delivers mellowing and euphoric cerebral effects. Finger-like bulbs reach out from the citrus-scented buds wrapped in crystal trichomes. Lamb’s Bread is counted among its progeny, although King’s Bread’s lineage is not well documented. Pain relief, appetite stimulation, and stress alleviation are just a few of the therapeutic benefits King’s Bread has to offer.\nAmnesia\n\nAmnesia is typically a sativa-dominant cannabis strain with some variation between breeders. Skunk, Cinderella 99, and Jack Herer are some of Amnesia’s genetic forerunners, passing on uplifting, creative, and euphoric effects ideal for treating mood disorders. This strain normally has a high THC and low CBD profile and produces intense psychotropic effects that new consumers should be wary of.\nCritical Kush\n\nCritical Kush from Barney’s Farm is a mostly indica strain that blends together two famed cannabis staples, Critical Mass and OG Kush. Aromatic notes of earthiness and spice usher in a calming sensation that relaxes the mind and body. Critical Kush pairs a staggeringly high THC content with a moderate dose of CBD, making this strain a perfect nighttime medication for pain, stress, insomnia, and muscle spasms.\nPineapple Chunk\n\nPineapple Chunk, bred by Barney’s Farm, is an indica-leaning hybrid that induces heavy full-body effects and a fast-paced head buzz. This THC-rich strain combines a Cheese and Skunk #1 cross with Barney’s Pineapple, and you can almost smell its lineage through sour notes of tangy skunk, earthy cheese, and sweet pineapple.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12001525/cannapics-our-favorite-cannabis-photos-on-leafly-this-month.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/cannapics-our-favorite-cannabis-photos-on-leafly-this-month"},{"id":"contentitems-3239","title":"New Strains Alert: Buddha Tahoe, Skunk Dawg, Cerebro Haze, Maui Pineapple Chunk, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1432742400000)\/","text":"Ask and you shall receive, good people of Leafly. Elected by you, this week\u0027s new strains include Buddha Tahoe, Skunk Dawg, Cerebro Haze, Maui Pineapple Chunk, Dreamer\u0027s Glass, Special Kush #1, and Booger (yes, \"Booger\"). Read more about each variety below, and if you\u0027ve come across any of these newcomers in your own strain hunting, enlighten us with a strain review. Keep the tips coming!\n \n   1. Maui Pineapple Chunk\n\nMaui Pineapple Chunk is a 50/50 hybrid bred by Pau Mana Seeds, who crossed Pineapple Chunk with their Nāhiku Maui Waui to create this balanced Hawaiian strain. Sweet and sour tropical flavors reminiscent of this strain’s homeland deliver you to a calm, uplifted mindset far away from stress.\n\n \n   2. Buddha Tahoe\n\nBuddha Tahoe is what you get when Big Buddha Seeds reverses Cali Connection’s Tahoe OG Kush to create their own rendition of this indica staple. Like its OG ancestors, Buddha Tahoe maintains a zesty lemon and earthy hash aroma typical of kush varieties. Potent and long-lasting, Buddha Tahoe launches you into to the highest level of cerebral euphoria which won this strain 3rd place in the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup.\n\n \n   3. Skunk Dawg\n\nSkunk Dawg is a sativa-dominant cross between Super Skunk and Chemdawg that elevates the mood with a sweet and sour aroma. Its effects are long-lasting but clear-headed, making Skunk Dawg a popular choice for use throughout the day. This sativa may be all you need to give your appetite an edge or to help you stay productive and focused.\n\n \n   4. Dreamer\u0027s Glass\n\nDreamer’s Glass is a hybrid cannabis strain that delivers dreamy euphoric effects alongside heavy body effects that let you settle deeply in relaxation. This strain is great for patients needing potent relief of nausea and mild pain, but expect to feel more and more anchored to your couch as you increase the dose.\n\n \n   5. Special Kush #1\n\nSpecial Kush #1 by Royal Queen Seeds is an 80/20 indica-dominant strain that descends from the original varieties of the Afghanistan and Pakistan region. Those who love the physical and deeply relaxing effects typical of indicas won’t be disappointed by the heavy-hitting qualities of Special Kush #1. This indica isn’t difficult to cultivate, but she requires a warm environment and plenty of room to grow wild for best results.\n\n \n   6. Cerebro Haze\n\nCerebro Haze is a sativa-dominant strain that crosses Brain OG with Tom Hills Haze. As its name suggests, Cerebro Haze focuses its efforts in the head and provides a clean, clear buzz that allows you to stay active and functional. Despite its sativa influence, Cerebro Haze still provides relaxing full-body effects preferred by patients treating pain and headaches.\n\n \n   7. Booger\n\nBooger may not have an appetizing name, but a look at this hybrid’s genetics may be all the convincing you need to give this strain a try: Strawberry Cough combines with Bubba Kush to create a balanced effect that walks the line between physical relaxation and cerebral energy. This Colorado native introduces itself with a sweet berry and sour skunk aroma while earthy, hashy flavors are detected on the exhale. With uplifting and calming effects, Booger uncoils stress and worry while encouraging a more lighthearted outlook on life (because seriously, you’re consuming a strain called “Booger”).","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/12002005/new-strains-alert-buddha-tahoe-skunk-dawg-cerebro-haze-maui-pinea.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-buddha-tahoe-skunk-dawg-cerebro-haze-maui-pinea"}],"reviewCount":270,"flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple","score":47.029742765273312},{"name":"Sweet","score":31.592086459449803},{"name":"Cheese","score":30.064755269739194},{"name":"Skunk","score":26.19774919614148},{"name":"Earthy","score":22.287424080028583}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":74.427027509824939},{"name":"Happy","score":66.678277956413},{"name":"Uplifted","score":60.370668095748485},{"name":"Euphoric","score":56.035637727759912},{"name":"Giggly","score":35.123258306538048}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":42.220435869953562},{"name":"Pain","score":41.898892461593427},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":27.185155412647376},{"name":"Depression","score":25.247409789210433},{"name":"Insomnia","score":17.29456948910325}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":23.200250089317613},{"name":"Arthritis","score":11.739460521614863},{"name":"PMS","score":10.789121114683816},{"name":"PTSD","score":8.59592711682744},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":6.0521614862450877}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":19.720882458020721},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":13.186405859235443},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.9149696320114327},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.8345837799214006},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.8345837799214006}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_5d0a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1006231/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_99d0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_0ab1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000634/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_4fa8.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_9573.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/702995/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_9943.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_c217.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/672408/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_4d72.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_f740.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/662160/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_39c6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_22a6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/644042/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_e42e.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":139,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Portland, OR","Spokane, WA","Toronto, ON","Ottawa, ON","Denver, CO","Eugene, OR","Everett, WA","Bellingham, WA","Medford, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-chunk","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.45925925925926/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Pineapple","subtitle":null,"slug":"pineapple","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple","symbol":"Pin","applink":"leafly://strain/pineapple"},{"name":"Cheese","subtitle":null,"slug":"cheese","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese","symbol":"Che","applink":"leafly://strain/cheese"},{"name":"Skunk #1","subtitle":null,"slug":"skunk-1","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1","symbol":"Sk1","applink":"leafly://strain/skunk-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Maui Pineapple Chunk\n\nMaui Pineapple Chunk is a 50/50 hybrid bred by Pau Mana Seeds, who crossed Pineapple Chunk with their Nāhiku Maui Waui to create this balanced Hawaiian strain. Sweet and sour tropical flavors reminiscent of this strain’s homeland deliver you to a calm, uplifted mindset far away from stress.\n\n \n   2. Buddha Tahoe\n\nBuddha Tahoe is what you get when Big Buddha Seeds reverses Cali Connection’s Tahoe OG Kush to create their own rendition of this indica staple. Like its OG ancestors, Buddha Tahoe maintains a zesty lemon and earthy hash aroma typical of kush varieties. Potent and long-lasting, Buddha Tahoe launches you into to the highest level of cerebral euphoria which won this strain 3rd place in the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup.\n\n \n   3. Skunk Dawg\n\nSkunk Dawg is a sativa-dominant cross between Super Skunk and Chemdawg that elevates the mood with a sweet and sour aroma. Its effects are long-lasting but clear-headed, making Skunk Dawg a popular choice for use throughout the day. This sativa may be all you need to give your appetite an edge or to help you stay productive and focused.\n\n \n   4. Dreamer\u0027s Glass\n\nDreamer’s Glass is a hybrid cannabis strain that delivers dreamy euphoric effects alongside heavy body effects that let you settle deeply in relaxation. This strain is great for patients needing potent relief of nausea and mild pain, but expect to feel more and more anchored to your couch as you increase the dose.\n\n \n   5. Special Kush #1\n\nSpecial Kush #1 by Royal Queen Seeds is an 80/20 indica-dominant strain that descends from the original varieties of the Afghanistan and Pakistan region. Those who love the physical and deeply relaxing effects typical of indicas won’t be disappointed by the heavy-hitting qualities of Special Kush #1. This indica isn’t difficult to cultivate, but she requires a warm environment and plenty of room to grow wild for best results.\n\n \n   6. Cerebro Haze\n\nCerebro Haze is a sativa-dominant strain that crosses Brain OG with Tom Hills Haze. As its name suggests, Cerebro Haze focuses its efforts in the head and provides a clean, clear buzz that allows you to stay active and functional. Despite its sativa influence, Cerebro Haze still provides relaxing full-body effects preferred by patients treating pain and headaches.\n\n \n   7. Booger\n\nBooger may not have an appetizing name, but a look at this hybrid’s genetics may be all the convincing you need to give this strain a try: Strawberry Cough combines with Bubba Kush to create a balanced effect that walks the line between physical relaxation and cerebral energy. This Colorado native introduces itself with a sweet berry and sour skunk aroma while earthy, hashy flavors are detected on the exhale. With uplifting and calming effects, Booger uncoils stress and worry while encouraging a more lighthearted outlook on life (because seriously, you’re consuming a strain called “Booger”).","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/12002005/new-strains-alert-buddha-tahoe-skunk-dawg-cerebro-haze-maui-pinea.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-buddha-tahoe-skunk-dawg-cerebro-haze-maui-pinea"}],"reviewCount":270,"flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple","score":47.029742765273312},{"name":"Sweet","score":31.592086459449803},{"name":"Cheese","score":30.064755269739194},{"name":"Skunk","score":26.19774919614148},{"name":"Earthy","score":22.287424080028583}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":74.427027509824939},{"name":"Happy","score":66.678277956413},{"name":"Uplifted","score":60.370668095748485},{"name":"Euphoric","score":56.035637727759912},{"name":"Giggly","score":35.123258306538048}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":42.220435869953562},{"name":"Pain","score":41.898892461593427},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":27.185155412647376},{"name":"Depression","score":25.247409789210433},{"name":"Insomnia","score":17.29456948910325}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":23.200250089317613},{"name":"Arthritis","score":11.739460521614863},{"name":"PMS","score":10.789121114683816},{"name":"PTSD","score":8.59592711682744},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":6.0521614862450877}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":19.720882458020721},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":13.186405859235443},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.9149696320114327},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.8345837799214006},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.8345837799214006}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_5d0a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1006231/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_99d0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_0ab1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000634/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_4fa8.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_9573.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/702995/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_9943.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_c217.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/672408/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_4d72.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_f740.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/662160/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_39c6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-chunk_100x100_22a6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/644042/b/pineapple-chunk__primary_e42e.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":139,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Portland, OR","Spokane, WA","Toronto, ON","Ottawa, ON","Denver, CO","Eugene, OR","Everett, WA","Bellingham, WA","Medford, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-chunk","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.45925925925926/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Pineapple","subtitle":null,"slug":"pineapple","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple","symbol":"Pin","applink":"leafly://strain/pineapple"},{"name":"Cheese","subtitle":null,"slug":"cheese","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese","symbol":"Che","applink":"leafly://strain/cheese"},{"name":"Skunk #1","subtitle":null,"slug":"skunk-1","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1","symbol":"Sk1","applink":"leafly://strain/skunk-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

The smells of its parents are quite strong, with the Cheese and PIneapple parents standing out in the scent. The unmistakable skunk is sort of a subtle background player on this one, and that\u0027s not necessarily a bad thing (since it allows the pineapple, in particular, to stand out).\n\nThe effects are definitely Sativa. It\u0027s a creeper - when you first hit it, you feel almost nothing; but, after about a minute, you start to feel it slowly creep on, reaching full intensity in about 4 or 5 minutes after the first hit. It\u0027s a strong, clear, and focused high. It is a bit trippy and racy in high amounts, and since it creeps on you, these amounts are easy to attain. This is a fantastic strain for sparking creativity or hanging out in a social setting. Some people may feel a sense of peripheral anxiety; however, at the same time, this strain is fantastic for easing social anxiety. Think of it this way - hanging out with a group of friends will be even easier than it was before. But, as soon as you hear a loud noise outside, everyone is scared shitless. That\u0027s how this strain works.

We’ve even seen dick pics. (Yes, we see each and every one you upload. No, you’re not the first one to think of submitting your junk.)\n\nThe more images each strain page has, the more it helps other consumers who are looking for information about a particular cannabis strain. To encourage more photo submissions, as well as to highlight examples of which images to upload, we decided to share a monthly roundup of a few of the best strain photos Leafly has to offer.\nHave you ever shared your strain photos on Leafly?

Upload your strain photos through our iOS or Android App today!\nRomulan\n\nRomulan, named after the alien Star Trek race, is a powerful indica revered for its potent therapeutic qualities. Though mostly indica, Romulan growers insist sativa genetics have crept in over time, lending it intense cerebral effects. These squat, pine-scented plants produce dense frosty buds that have found their following among connoisseurs in B.C. and the Pacific Northwest.\nKing’s Bread\n\nSaid to be a sativa landrace from the Blue Mountains of Jamaica, King’s Bread (or King’s Breath) delivers mellowing and euphoric cerebral effects. Finger-like bulbs reach out from the citrus-scented buds wrapped in crystal trichomes. Lamb’s Bread is counted among its progeny, although King’s Bread’s lineage is not well documented. Pain relief, appetite stimulation, and stress alleviation are just a few of the therapeutic benefits King’s Bread has to offer.\nAmnesia\n\nAmnesia is typically a sativa-dominant cannabis strain with some variation between breeders. Skunk, Cinderella 99, and Jack Herer are some of Amnesia’s genetic forerunners, passing on uplifting, creative, and euphoric effects ideal for treating mood disorders. This strain normally has a high THC and low CBD profile and produces intense psychotropic effects that new consumers should be wary of.\nCritical Kush\n\nCritical Kush from Barney’s Farm is a mostly indica strain that blends together two famed cannabis staples, Critical Mass and OG Kush. Aromatic notes of earthiness and spice usher in a calming sensation that relaxes the mind and body. Critical Kush pairs a staggeringly high THC content with a moderate dose of CBD, making this strain a perfect nighttime medication for pain, stress, insomnia, and muscle spasms.\nPineapple Chunk\n\nPineapple Chunk, bred by Barney’s Farm, is an indica-leaning hybrid that induces heavy full-body effects and a fast-paced head buzz. This THC-rich strain combines a Cheese and Skunk #1 cross with Barney’s Pineapple, and you can almost smell its lineage through sour notes of tangy skunk, earthy cheese, and sweet pineapple.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12001525/cannapics-our-favorite-cannabis-photos-on-leafly-this-month.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/cannapics-our-favorite-cannabis-photos-on-leafly-this-month"},{"id":"contentitems-3239","title":"New Strains Alert: Buddha Tahoe, Skunk Dawg, Cerebro Haze, Maui Pineapple Chunk, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1432742400000)\/","text":"Ask and you shall receive, good people of Leafly.
