            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Pineapple Kush was first produced by crossing Pineapple with Master Kush. Kush strains are generally known for their pungent, piney aroma, and this cross sweetens the flavor with tropical notes. This popular Kush variety offers a quality cerebral high with uplifting effects that allow the consumer to stay active and engaged.\nGrow Techniques: Overall, Pineapple Kush is an easy strain for novice growers. Keep it indoors to provide an ideal climate, and try growing in soil or hydroponically. Consider using the SOG (sea of green) method while keeping the plants tightly pruned to direct growth to the top colas. To keep plants from falling over, trellis for support as the buds put on density.\nFlowering Time: 8 weeks\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Easy to moderate\nClimate: Unlike some Kush strains, Pineapple Kush can handle higher humidity levels without having issues with mold. It prefers a temperature between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Pineapple Kush does best indoors in a controlled climate.\nFeeding: Like all OG varieties, feed on the heavier side. Go heavy on the CalMag and top dress the soils with phosphorus-rich nutrients when going into flowering.",

Really nice aroma, flavor is quite intense, very dense buds, I'd say Pinapple Kush is definitely more of a head high than it is body, being a Sativa dominant I expected such. Was surprised and quite happy to find that about 15 min later I realized that I was both up, completely worry/care free, giddy and happy. The body high also allowed me to feel quite relaxed at the same time. Intense high, great flavor and smell, can have the affect of alleviating depression/anxiety/trauma, etc.... 4.5/5 ",
