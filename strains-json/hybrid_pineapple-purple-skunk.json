Pineapple Purple Skunk\n\nBred by MTG Seeds, Pineapple Purple Skunk is a hybrid cannabis strain that combines Pineapple and Purple Skunk genetics.

Uplifting and euphoric, Cosmic Collision offers a brighter outlook for those suffering from stress and depression.\n\n \n   7. Heaven Scent\n\nHeaven Scent is a hybrid cannabis strain that crosses genetics from God’s Gift and Green Crack.

Dense buds take on an intense purple hue at the end of Black Cherry OG’s maturation and develop a sweet aroma like fruity tea. Relaxing full-body effects take over, ridding you of pain and insomnia while lifting the mood.\n\n \n   6. Cosmic Collision\n\nCosmic Collision is a sativa-dominant strain from MTG Seeds, who crossed Cosmic Charlie and Piña Collision into a fusion that boasts both flavor and potency.

Uplifting and euphoric, Cosmic Collision offers a brighter outlook for those suffering from stress and depression.\n\n \n   7. Heaven Scent\n\nHeaven Scent is a hybrid cannabis strain that crosses genetics from God’s Gift and Green Crack. The polar opposite effects of its indica and sativa parents meet halfway, delivering you to a balanced state of blissful, relaxed happiness. Its buds express themselves in hues that range from deep blue to dark purple.\n\n \n   8. Godfather Purple Kush\n\nGodfather Purple Kush is an indica-dominant cross between Godfather, Purple Kush, and Afghani.
