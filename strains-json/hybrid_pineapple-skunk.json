I tend to have the opposite effects, where a Sativa would give you Energy, it would put me to sleep. Indica\u0027s give me energy and I am able to function better than normal like a well oiled machine. It\u0027s great for pain and if you tend get a lot done today, and have the opposing effects like I do then I recommend this strain.\n------- \nCliff Notes\nBefore: Pain was 8/10, stress was a 9/10, ADHD 6/10\nAfter: Pain 3/10 stress 1/10, ADHD 0/10","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1637249,"username":"nooxb","text":"this is a very good strain, i’m pretty naked lmao \ndepression before smoking: 7/10\nanxiety before smoking: 10/10\ndepression after: 2\nanxiety after:4","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/5DsWrIpoq-56NpD59UXAqpoVN88=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fqSLuo6zNRCeIia1paBYS_wayfarers-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3407","title":"New Strains Alert: Strawberry Blue, Blackberry Haze, Sugar Punch, Pineapple Skunk, and Hardcore OG","author":"Anna Wilcox","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1411761600000)\/","text":"Summer may be over, but that doesn\u0027t mean an end to fun and fruity summertime flavors.
