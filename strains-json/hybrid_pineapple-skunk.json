            "text": "This hit me hard within the first 15 minutes, I only needed a little. Which was surprising compared to most of the other strains I do. I usually take about 30-40 hits in order to become fully medicated.  I tend to have the opposite effects, where a Sativa would give you Energy, it would put me to sleep. Indica's give me energy and I am able to function better than normal like a well oiled machine. It's great for pain and if you tend get a lot done today, and have the opposing effects like I do then I recommend this strain.\n------- \nCliff Notes\nBefore: Pain was 8/10, stress was a 9/10, ADHD 6/10\nAfter: Pain 3/10 stress 1/10, ADHD 0/10",
