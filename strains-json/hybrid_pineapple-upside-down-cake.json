            "text": "An interesting strain that has a name which at first was a bit put offish.  Only because growing up pineapples were the last thing my cake needed.  It was a healthy cake to me with that image & rebellious anti healthy cake attitude following into adulthood.  In fact it is one of my favorite flavors of ice cream, pineapples & cherries I adore, but damn it sounds like the waste of a good cake.  All of that changed with this strain.\n\nThis strain was passed over a few times even at a decent price and my love of experimenting with CBD in my cannabis diet.  Finally giving in one night after catching a whiff off a jar someone opened about 10 feet away.  It was tropical, sweet, and made me want to mop my floor.  Pineapple strain unto itself is one of my greatest cleaning aids because it sets my ass in motion,  A challenging feat to say the least. \n\nOnce I am going watch me soar, but maybe pull up a chair and wait until some good motivational herb comes through town =) I'll clean your house too, not!  That ol factory note of beautiful coastal sometimes island warm coastal breeze.  Pineapple is a strain that doesn't hit the shelves at any of the 15 dispensaries hopped monthly.  Miss it, so went for a relative who had a similar nose.  The buds were fairly dense varying from small nugglets to medium sized buds.\n\nPersonally, joints are meant to be rolled with this medicine especially if mixed with other strains.  By itself is a little to light for me, but next to some higher percentage heavy indicas this flower shines in flavor.  Literally brilliant on your tongue spreading throughout your body like a spark of calmness.  Peace of mind.  But it felt like a more sativa dominant CBD which is my preference.  For me a 4/1 ration of THC/CBD was perfect with this flavor bringing out some remarkable terpene greatness from whichever strain it mingles with.\n\nAlone it tasted like burnt marshmallows and pineapple so not far off from its namesake.  Buds crumbled nicely and burned for a long time.  By far my favorite flower or even CBD, but it def has a purpose.  If not only for neat flavor combos there is a huge sense of mental peace that comes with a medium to small range of pain.  Did not make me immediately sleepy like most CBD aside from its  cannabidiol rich sativa dominant brother strains like Medihaze.  When available at decent price I will always keep some on hand as a mixer or mild medicine.",
