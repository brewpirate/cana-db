Leafly and General Hydroponics are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Pineapple Kush was first produced by crossing Pineapple with Master Kush. Kush strains are generally known for their pungent, piney aroma, and this cross sweetens the flavor with tropical notes. This popular Kush variety offers a quality cerebral high with uplifting effects that allow the consumer to stay active and engaged.\nGrow Techniques: Overall, Pineapple Kush is an easy strain for novice growers. Keep it indoors to provide an ideal climate, and try growing in soil or hydroponically. Consider using the SOG (sea of green) method while keeping the plants tightly pruned to direct growth to the top colas. To keep plants from falling over, trellis for support as the buds put on density.\nFlowering Time: 8 weeks\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Easy to moderate\nClimate: Unlike some Kush strains, Pineapple Kush can handle higher humidity levels without having issues with mold. It prefers a temperature between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Pineapple Kush does best indoors in a controlled climate.\nFeeding: Like all OG varieties, feed on the heavier side. Go heavy on the CalMag and top dress the soils with phosphorus-rich nutrients when going into flowering.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/30105221/pineapple-kush-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-pinapple-kush-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":463,"flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple","score":47.986969082303773},{"name":"Tropical","score":23.861331366402361},{"name":"Sweet","score":23.162148872088018},{"name":"Citrus","score":18.719650869752286},{"name":"Earthy","score":13.91910996373471}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":62.966377773680009},{"name":"Euphoric","score":58.49007314524556},{"name":"Relaxed","score":50.052246603970744},{"name":"Uplifted","score":35.793533714426204},{"name":"Focused","score":35.343290921384224}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":40.988997479869688},{"name":"Depression","score":38.999016534513487},{"name":"Pain","score":22.462966377773679},{"name":"Fatigue","score":18.764214149609685},{"name":"Headaches","score":10.712090478824758}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":33.858872702686092},{"name":"PTSD","score":23.071485647550556},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":16.772696539430818},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":14.558362529964963},{"name":"Migraines","score":14.27561620259389}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":24.588173827524741},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":15.392771528674166},{"name":"Anxious","score":8.9141926363021682},{"name":"Paranoid","score":7.9476304628434438},{"name":"Dizzy","score":4.9188640973630831}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_4f36.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/652970/b/pineapple__primary_4929.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_f0d3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/637674/b/pineapple__primary_91ab.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_748a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/634192/b/pineapple__primary_4eb7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_03ea.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619125/b/pineapple__primary_ccf3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_6fe8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/611765/b/pineapple__primary_8d24.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_2ad8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/610445/b/pineapple__primary_607b.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":122,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Denver, CO","Vancouver, BC","Seattle, WA","Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Detroit, MI","Las Vegas, NV","Spokane, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.21814254859611/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Ed Rosenthal Super Bud","subtitle":null,"slug":"ed-rosenthal-super-bud","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud","symbol":"Ed","applink":"leafly://strain/ed-rosenthal-super-bud"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Go heavy on the CalMag and top dress the soils with phosphorus-rich nutrients when going into flowering.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/30105221/pineapple-kush-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-pinapple-kush-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":463,"flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple","score":47.986969082303773},{"name":"Tropical","score":23.861331366402361},{"name":"Sweet","score":23.162148872088018},{"name":"Citrus","score":18.719650869752286},{"name":"Earthy","score":13.91910996373471}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":62.966377773680009},{"name":"Euphoric","score":58.49007314524556},{"name":"Relaxed","score":50.052246603970744},{"name":"Uplifted","score":35.793533714426204},{"name":"Focused","score":35.343290921384224}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":40.988997479869688},{"name":"Depression","score":38.999016534513487},{"name":"Pain","score":22.462966377773679},{"name":"Fatigue","score":18.764214149609685},{"name":"Headaches","score":10.712090478824758}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":33.858872702686092},{"name":"PTSD","score":23.071485647550556},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":16.772696539430818},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":14.558362529964963},{"name":"Migraines","score":14.27561620259389}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":24.588173827524741},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":15.392771528674166},{"name":"Anxious","score":8.9141926363021682},{"name":"Paranoid","score":7.9476304628434438},{"name":"Dizzy","score":4.9188640973630831}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_4f36.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/652970/b/pineapple__primary_4929.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_f0d3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/637674/b/pineapple__primary_91ab.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_748a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/634192/b/pineapple__primary_4eb7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_03ea.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619125/b/pineapple__primary_ccf3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_6fe8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/611765/b/pineapple__primary_8d24.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_2ad8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/610445/b/pineapple__primary_607b.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":122,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Denver, CO","Vancouver, BC","Seattle, WA","Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Detroit, MI","Las Vegas, NV","Spokane, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.21814254859611/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Ed Rosenthal Super Bud","subtitle":null,"slug":"ed-rosenthal-super-bud","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud","symbol":"Ed","applink":"leafly://strain/ed-rosenthal-super-bud"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Enter Pineapple: my current superhero strain. \n\nPineapple provides a cheerful, energetic high without the racing thoughts or paranoia of some sativa-dominant strains.   (I get full-blown panic attacks from many strains but this one does not cause them in any setting).  It\u0027s ideal for afternoon use when you need a little pick-me-up.  Best of all, it doesn\u0027t cause drowsiness or have a sedating comedown.  Score!\n\nThe smell and smoke thickness are not the greatest, but maybe my batch was just dried/cured improperly.  That\u0027s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.\n\nIf I had to sum up this strain in 5 words, they would be:  \n\n- Happy\n- Mellow\n- Invigorating\n- Sunny \n- Cerebral\n\nI look forward to trying the other Pineapple strains (Pineapple Express \u0026 Golden Pineapple are high on the list).

Leafly and General Hydroponics are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Pineapple Kush was first produced by crossing Pineapple with Master Kush. Kush strains are generally known for their pungent, piney aroma, and this cross sweetens the flavor with tropical notes. This popular Kush variety offers a quality cerebral high with uplifting effects that allow the consumer to stay active and engaged.\nGrow Techniques: Overall, Pineapple Kush is an easy strain for novice growers. Keep it indoors to provide an ideal climate, and try growing in soil or hydroponically. Consider using the SOG (sea of green) method while keeping the plants tightly pruned to direct growth to the top colas. To keep plants from falling over, trellis for support as the buds put on density.\nFlowering Time: 8 weeks\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Easy to moderate\nClimate: Unlike some Kush strains, Pineapple Kush can handle higher humidity levels without having issues with mold. It prefers a temperature between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Pineapple Kush does best indoors in a controlled climate.\nFeeding: Like all OG varieties, feed on the heavier side. Go heavy on the CalMag and top dress the soils with phosphorus-rich nutrients when going into flowering.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/30105221/pineapple-kush-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-pinapple-kush-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":463,"flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple","score":47.986969082303773},{"name":"Tropical","score":23.861331366402361},{"name":"Sweet","score":23.162148872088018},{"name":"Citrus","score":18.719650869752286},{"name":"Earthy","score":13.91910996373471}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":62.966377773680009},{"name":"Euphoric","score":58.49007314524556},{"name":"Relaxed","score":50.052246603970744},{"name":"Uplifted","score":35.793533714426204},{"name":"Focused","score":35.343290921384224}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":40.988997479869688},{"name":"Depression","score":38.999016534513487},{"name":"Pain","score":22.462966377773679},{"name":"Fatigue","score":18.764214149609685},{"name":"Headaches","score":10.712090478824758}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":33.858872702686092},{"name":"PTSD","score":23.071485647550556},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":16.772696539430818},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":14.558362529964963},{"name":"Migraines","score":14.27561620259389}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":24.588173827524741},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":15.392771528674166},{"name":"Anxious","score":8.9141926363021682},{"name":"Paranoid","score":7.9476304628434438},{"name":"Dizzy","score":4.9188640973630831}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_4f36.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/652970/b/pineapple__primary_4929.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_f0d3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/637674/b/pineapple__primary_91ab.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_748a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/634192/b/pineapple__primary_4eb7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_03ea.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619125/b/pineapple__primary_ccf3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_6fe8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/611765/b/pineapple__primary_8d24.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple_100x100_2ad8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/610445/b/pineapple__primary_607b.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":122,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Denver, CO","Vancouver, BC","Seattle, WA","Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Detroit, MI","Las Vegas, NV","Spokane, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.21814254859611/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Ed Rosenthal Super Bud","subtitle":null,"slug":"ed-rosenthal-super-bud","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud","symbol":"Ed","applink":"leafly://strain/ed-rosenthal-super-bud"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
