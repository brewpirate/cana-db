We love that they slow down and take a little time with their cannabis crops from start to finish.\n\nPineapple by Fire Bros.\nAvailable in: Washington\nA Seattle favorite, Fire Bros. works with their own phenotypes to produce the most effective cannabis flower for consumers. For an uplifting hybrid strain such as Pineapple, stress-relieving characteristics are an important facet enhanced by Fire Bros.\u2019 hand-selection process.\nHybrid Blend by Lowell Farms\nAvailable in: California\nLowell Farms, which works exclusively with flower, offers seasonal blends of their best strains, and we can\u2019t get enough of their hybrid pre-rolls. We appreciate that they\u2019re thinking outside the box in focusing on balanced flower mixes rather than strain-specific products. Grown in organic fertilizer free of pesticides, Lowell takes pride in their dedication to all-natural cannabis as well as in providing good wages for their workers.\nAlso featured in: What Are You Smoking? Episode 3\nZkittlez by Royal Choice Farms\nAvailable in: Arizona\nArizona does not require pesticide testing for cannabis, so it\u2019s all the more important to find a grower you can trust. Royal Choice Farms chose to be an all-organic operation built on a whole lot of love and no pesticides. By instating natural grow methods, Royal Choice keeps our minds at ease when we\u2019re lighting up their sweet indica Zkittles.\n\nCBD Blue Shark by Marley Natural Red\nAvailable in: California, Oregon, Washington*\nWith a full cannabis operation dedicated to Jamaica\u2019s rich culture, Marley Natural hits it out of the park with their hand-selected flower line\u2014notably, the anti-inflammatory and CBD-rich hybrid CBD Blue Shark. Cultivated by independent growers, we love Marley Natural\u2019s dedication to craft cannabis, their commitment to sustainable growing practices, and their RISE UP social justice program.\nBlack Cherry Soda by Royal Tree Gardens\nAvailable in: Washington\nHaving built a facility from the ground up, Washington\u2019s Royal Tree Gardens is a company steeped in perseverance. Licensed since 2014, Royal Tree Farms has been producing fantastic cannabis ever since, and their sativa-dominant Black Cherry Soda is no exception. We\u2019ve been packing our bowls with this strain for its potent relief, particularly for the medical patients among us.\nDo-Si-Dos by Matrix NV\nAvailable in: Nevada\nOne of the best in medical-grade cannabis production, Nevada\u2019s Matrix NV keeps their focus on the people who will consume their products, and that\u2019s why we love them. Their flower, including the deliciously heavy indica Do-Si-Dos, is cared for by a team of passionate people who use purified and organic products to cultivate their hand-trimmed flower collection.\nAlso featured in: Leafly TV\u2019s Growers: Episode 101\n\nOrange Blossom by Falcanna\nAvailable in: Washington\nA small medical operation turned Tier III licensed producer, Falcanna has seen it all when comes to cannabis\u2014from the garden to the shop. Their dedication to the herb started as a dream between founders Bethany and Justin Rondeau and turned into a full grow facility delivering exceptional cannabis across Washington State. Their bright, floral hybrid Orange Blossom is as tasty as it is elevating and provides a perfect example of their dedication to quality flower.\nWhite Tahoe Cookies by Archive Portland\nAvailable in: Oregon\nWith multiple awards under their belt, Archive Portland boasts a team of growers with over 35 years of collective cannabis growing experience. That dedication to quality trickles down to the buds, where the exceptional indica White Tahoe Cookies takes on a smooth sedative high that keeps us coming back for more.\nLemonder by Seattle\u2019s Private Reserve\nAvailable in: Washington\nWe save Seattle\u2019s Private Reserve flower for special occasions; grown in a facility that is tightly sealed and meticulously controlled, the euphoric hybrid Lemonder has found its way into our stash boxes and smoke circles throughout 2017. SPR\u2019s rigorous testing of all their cannabis products lets us consume with full peace of mind.\nLead image by\u00a0Nastasic/iStock\n*Editor\u2019s note: Leafly and Marley Natural are owned by the same parent company.

Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Pineapple Kush was first produced by crossing Pineapple with Master Kush. Kush strains are generally known for their pungent, piney aroma, and this cross sweetens the flavor with tropical notes. This popular Kush variety offers a quality cerebral high with uplifting effects that allow the consumer to stay active and engaged.\nGrow Techniques: Overall, Pineapple Kush is an easy strain for novice growers. Keep it indoors to provide an ideal climate, and try growing in soil or hydroponically. Consider using the SOG (sea of green) method while keeping the plants tightly pruned to direct growth to the top colas. To keep plants from falling over, trellis for support as the buds put on density.\nFlowering Time: 8 weeks\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Easy to moderate\nClimate: Unlike some Kush strains, Pineapple Kush can handle higher humidity levels without having issues with mold. It prefers a temperature between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Pineapple Kush does best indoors in a controlled climate.\nFeeding: Like all OG varieties, feed on the heavier side. Go heavy on the CalMag and top dress the soils with phosphorus-rich nutrients when going into flowering.",

            "text": "Finding a strain that treats lethargic depression and boosts energy without triggering anxiety or paranoia is a challenge, especially when you're prone to cannabis-induced anxiety.  Enter Pineapple: my current superhero strain. \n\nPineapple provides a cheerful, energetic high without the racing thoughts or paranoia of some sativa-dominant strains.   (I get full-blown panic attacks from many strains but this one does not cause them in any setting).  It's ideal for afternoon use when you need a little pick-me-up.  Best of all, it doesn't cause drowsiness or have a sedating comedown.  Score!\n\nThe smell and smoke thickness are not the greatest, but maybe my batch was just dried/cured improperly.  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.\n\nIf I had to sum up this strain in 5 words, they would be:  \n\n- Happy\n- Mellow\n- Invigorating\n- Sunny \n- Cerebral\n\nI look forward to trying the other Pineapple strains (Pineapple Express & Golden Pineapple are high on the list).  If they're anything like this gem, they'll be worth every penny.",
