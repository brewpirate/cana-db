Apparently, it's a rename of Etta Seeds' Pink Plant.\n\nI experienced a little couchlock, felt like I could just sit and chill without feeling like I was going to pass out and go to sleep. Very uplifting for me, with a decent amount of creativity boost. The pain in my foot from an old injury was completely gone and I could fully flex my big toe. Great option for pain relief without getting knocked out.\n\nThe bud itself smells a little fruity, a very pleasant odor. It forms some pretty dense buds, and very potent.\n\nI'd recommend anyone give it a shot.",
