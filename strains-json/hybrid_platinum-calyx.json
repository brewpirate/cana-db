            "text": "Like all good herb, the first thing you notice when tearing into a tasty bud is the smell and the almost blueberry coffee cake aroma. Definitely gets the appetite stirred.  As well I love the look and shape of the bud. It has these awesome snow capped Calyx peaks that stick out with hint of purple. I can really see why they named their company Calyx. \n    When I try a new strain I like to smoke with my morning coffee, so I get to feel the high on a blank slate notice the lasting effect through the day. I rolled a nice doobie, and spent the day harvesting at a friends garden. The first thing I noticed was a taste that matched it awesome smell. For me, taste is huge and the appetite a built smelling the herb while rolling was satisfied by its taste and then that nice first hit that hits you right between the eyes. \n    While I smoked and sipped my coffee I could feel a nice comfortable body high come over me and it took me a while to motivate and begin my day. Once I started moving and got the blood flowing, the body high shifted towards my head. My eyes were foggy but my head was clear. I was also surprisingly productive beside forgetting where I left my shears from time to time. The high lasted well into lunch and didn't feel the need to light up again until our afternoon brake.\n     Platinum Calyx is one of the better strains I have had in a long time, and the indoor grow who produced this is on point. Can't wait to get my hands on some more.",
