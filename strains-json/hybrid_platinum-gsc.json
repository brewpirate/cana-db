The force is strong with this strain, and we have no doubt it enabled a truly other-worldly 4/20!\n \nNorthern Lights\n\nNorthern Lights is another strain best consumed by those who observed the holiday from the comforts of home.

Those who rung in the holiday with this strain were treated to fast-acting energy and dreamy cerebral effects that lasted throughout the day. A perfect choice for 4/20!\n \nSour Kush\n\nSour Kush is a citrus-flavored hybrid offers the best of both worlds: it provides consumers an uplifting experience without overwhelming sedative effects, but it also delivers powerful pain relief. For this reason, it’s a great daytime strain for medical patients seeking relief. On 4/20, Sour Kush delivered the pain-relieving qualities you needed without sacrificing your energy.\n \nWhite Widow\n\nWhite Widow has achieved worldwide fame and it’s no wonder that Leafly users chose to celebrate the biggest industry holiday with this classic.
