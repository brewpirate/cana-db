The high is a nicely balanced hybrid high that soars like a sativa but is nice and social at the onset then mellows to a comfortable indica narcotic effect later. Great for pain, anxiety, relaxation, lack of appetite, depression, and spasms.",

In smaller doses it can aid in the creative process, help with some chronic pain, and make socializing even more enjoyable. In lager doses it can have you gleefully staring at blank wall (or help with insomnia). \nI've found this strain to be a definite creeper, with a stony high, and lots of euphoria. Definitely worth a try! ",
