Great if you need to get work DONE. But don\u0027t over do it, honestly, or you will know exactly what ADHD feels like, and I\u0027m not remotely close to joking. \nThis is a great \"going on a hike\" strain, it uplifts you and gives you a great energetic high and a little happy. But make sure you keep topping off, as the crash is a really serious crash, tired, very, very tired, which is no good if you\u0027re on a hike. Couple this strain with some Golden pineapple and you will go from energetic, to nice calm stone, and end your night with a few hits from cannatonic...I feel these three are the trifecta of cannabis consumption on a camping day.\n\nThe high lasts a pretty decent while, I\u0027ll admit, I\u0027m a natural low tolerance user, and I\u0027m proud of that, 2-3 hits and I\u0027m in the clouds with this stuff. \nDo NOT use it for sleep. LOL, just don\u0027t.\n\n\nWhat it\u0027s NOT good for: Studying/focusing on school work. Paying any serious attention.\nI\u0027ll tell you why. Some strains like harlequin, are PERFECT for studying, it wakes you up, makes you focus, but is mellow. This strain goes from 0-100 fast and stays at 100 until the drop off, where it quickly goes back to 0. \nIf you have ADHD(like I do), stay AWAY from this if you\u0027re using it for school work. Stick with mild \"In the pines\"/\"canna tonic\"/harlequin type strains. Only time it\u0027s okay for an ADHD user to consume this strain is if you need the energy to battle the depression that sometimes sets in with ADHD, and it will help get you outside, as you will not really want to be inside while high on this. \n\nDO USE THIS FOR: shopping(bring a list, you tend to be forgetful on this), hiking, boating, any outdoor activity(minus rock climbing, that\u0027s just stupid). Doing laundry, cleaning the house, walking your dog.\n\nI gave it 4 stars due to the severe crash that I got after a very good body/mind high. \n\n60/40 mix this with canna tonic if you want results similar to the ever elusive Harlequin.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1623283,"username":"MarijuanaMYK","text":"üó£ Amazing üçÉ !

You novelty-seekers are probably wondering what Pineapple Dog Shit is all about ‚Äî it\u0027s likely the only strain on this list with a more unusual flavor combination than Cheese Candy.\nWe\u0027re pleased to inform our friends in Oregon that many of these strains are available right out your back door in Portland (be sure to say hello to the good folks of Oregon House of Herbs for us!). As for the rest of you non-Oregon folks, check the \"Availability\" tab on their strain pages to see if any of these varieties are offered in your area.\n¬†\n¬†¬†¬†1. Professor Chaos\nCharacteristics of Professor Chaos:\n\nProfessor Chaos is what you get when you combine the malevolent forces of Mad Scientist and Jack the Ripper, two strains that balance energy with merciless painkilling properties. This 65/35 sativa-dominant hybrid from TGA Genetics has a sour, spicy aroma that introduces its clear-headed effects perfect for patients needing a potent medicine without sacrificing productivity. Its buds form knobby, finger-like calyxes covered in a snow-like layer of crystal trichomes in a show of Professor Chaos‚Äô supervillain strength.\n\n¬†\n¬† ¬†2. Dr. Funk\nCharacteristics of Dr. Funk:\n\nDr. Funk is a mostly indica strain that balances genetics from Blueberry and Bubba Kush. You can taste this strain‚Äôs lineage as flavors of sweet berry and earthy sharpness activate on the exhale. Its tight, compact buds and orange hair-like pistils are obscured under a thick dusting of crystal trichomes, which hint at Dr. Funk‚Äôs potency.\n\nAvailable at Oregon House of Herbs\n¬†\n¬† ¬†3. Ice Queen\nCharacteristics of Ice Queen:\n\nIce Queen is a hybrid strain that crosses White Widow and Cinderella 99 in a sativa-heavy blend fit for royalty. Its light, loose buds are powdered with frost-like resin that blankets the buds like fresh snowfall. One whiff of Ice Queen fills your nose with a sweet bouquet of lavenderrose aromas accented by subtle pepper notes. Another variety of Ice Queen was once bred by No Mercy Seeds, who combined Master Ice and Valley Queen; however, you may find this rendition harder to come by in today‚Äôs market.\n\nAvailable at Oregon House of Herbs\n¬†\n¬† ¬†4. Paris XXX\nCharacteristics of Paris XXX:\n\nParis XXX is an extension of the Paris OG family that has placed in multiple Cannabis Cup competitions. This indica variety combines Headband OG, Chemdawg, and OG Kush genetics, creating a crisp, piney, and woody flavor on inhale. The fast-acting effects provide a balance of cerebral stimulation and full-body relaxation. Paris XXX is known to increase your appetite while also sparking creativity.\n\n¬†\n¬† ¬†5. Pineapple Dog Shit\nCharacteristics of Pineapple Dog Shit:\n\nPineapple Dog Shit is a hybrid strain that may not sound appetizing, but its elite parentage of Pineapple Punch and Chemdawg 4 is enough to draw connoisseurs of old school genetics. Its name is derived from its sour, tar-like aroma that could arguably be compared to canine byproduct, but one look at this hybrid‚Äôs knobby, dense, crystal-covered buds may convince you to push past its unconventional aroma. For those of you less interested in the novelty of Pineapple Dog Shit, we reassure you that the taste is a more pleasant blend of sweet tropical and citrus flavors.\n\nAvailable at Oregon House of Herbs\n¬†\n¬† ¬†6. Sour Urkle\nCharacteristics of Sour Urkle:\n\nSour Urkle is a hybrid cannabis strain that unites Sour Diesel and Purple Urkle, whose opposing sativa and indica genetics meet in a balanced and flavorful fusion. Hints of berry fight through the dominant skunky diesel smell of Sour Urkle, creating a complex aroma that will have you fighting your friends for the first taste. Its dense, rounded buds are caked in crystal-tipped trichomes that try their best to hide Sour Urkle‚Äôs deep purple coloration to no avail.\n\nAvailable at Oregon House of Herbs\n¬†\n¬† ¬†7. Cheese Candy\nCharacteristics of Cheese Candy:\n\nCheese Candy by Delicious Seeds is the hybrid lovechild of Cheese and Caramelo, a combination of parent strains that results in an unusual fusion of sweet candy and sharp cheese flavors. The sweet and sour aroma is accented by flowery, fruity flavors which usher in Cheese Candy‚Äôs deeply relaxing characteristics. Its long, slender buds are wrapped in fiery orange hairs that stand in vibrant contrast to this hybrid‚Äôs sage green hues.\n\nAvailable at Oregon House of Herbs","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/12002322/new-strains-alert-professor-chaos-ice-queen-sour-urkle-cheese-can.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-professor-chaos-ice-queen-sour-urkle-cheese-can"}],"reviewCount":32,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":57.478632478632477},{"name":"Sweet","score":50},{"name":"Citrus","score":12.286324786324787},{"name":"Pine","score":8.44017094017094},{"name":"Woody","score":6.517094017094017}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":96.474358974358964},{"name":"Uplifted","score":95.726495726495727},{"name":"Focused","score":90.17094017094017},{"name":"Euphoric","score":87.286324786324784},{"name":"Creative","score":85.57692307692308}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":91.880341880341888},{"name":"Depression","score":85.363247863247864},{"name":"Stress","score":65.918803418803421},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":56.517094017094017},{"name":"Fatigue","score":50.96153846153846}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":53.846153846153847},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":35.363247863247864},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":30.555555555555557},{"name":"PTSD","score":26.923076923076923},{"name":"Hypertension","score":25}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":38.034188034188034},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.9230769230769231},{"name":"Headache","score":0.96153846153846156}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/professor-chaos_100x100_c2a2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001032/b/professor-chaos__primary_49bd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/professor-chaos_100x100_3995.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000477/b/professor-chaos__primary_5921.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/professor-chaos_100x100_a1b0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/509903/b/professor-chaos__primary_f0dc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/professor-chaos_100x100_181b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/437812/b/professor-chaos__primary_c39b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/professor-chaos_100x100_5046.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/311066/b/professor-chaos__primary_2997.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/professor-chaos_100x100_de85.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/310026/b/professor-chaos__primary_2548.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":9,"popularCities":["Everett, WA","Arlington, WA","Bellingham, WA","Denver, CO","Detroit, MI","Edmonds, WA","Eugene, OR","Glendale, AZ","Granite Falls, WA","Mount Vernon, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/professor-chaos","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.59375/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Jack the Ripper","subtitle":null,"slug":"jack-the-ripper","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/jack-the-ripper","symbol":"Jtr","applink":"leafly://strain/jack-the-ripper"},{"name":"Mad Scientist","subtitle":null,"slug":"mad-scientist","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/mad-scientist","symbol":"Msc","applink":"leafly://strain/mad-scientist"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tTGA Genetics recommends topping early to encourage more rounded growth\n\tFour phenotypes can result:\u0026nbsp;two of which grow taller, two of which grow short\n\n"}}
