            "text": "Some people take astrology more seriously than others, but regardless of your level of obsession with all things zodiac, you at least know your star sign. That said, have you ever wondered which cannabis strain best reflects your astrological sign? We were curious so we took it upon ourselves to pair up the best strains that complement each personality type based on their horoscope sign.\nWhether you\u2019re as stubborn as a ram, as dramatic as a lion, or as balanced as a scale, we\u2019ve got a strain for you! So sit back, relax, and watch your stars and strains align.\nAries\n\nDates: \nMarch 21 \u2013 April 19\nCharacteristics: \nEnthusiastic, Energetic, Independent\nCannabis Strain: \n\nThis sativa-dominant strain will quell any unpleasant feelings with a soothing euphoric boost.

A hybrid blend, GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) (and its many descendants) are sure to put a smile on your face and bring you peace and relaxation. This is the strain you\u2019ll want for when you\u2019re looking to laugh until you giggle-snort (and then laugh some more).\nLeo\n\nDates: \nJuly 23 \u2013 August 22\nCharacteristics: \nConfident, Dramatic, Enthusiastic\nStrain:\n\nAdmittedly, you\u2019re a drama queen, but this strain is guaranteed to lessen the drama and up the ante with joy. Your verbal skills fall dormant and allow someone else to take the spotlight for a change, while you will find yourself quietly in awe at the beauty of the world. Pineapple Express is a freight train that runs on euphoria \u2013 all aboard!\nVirgo\n\nDates: \nAugust 23 \u2013 September 22\nCharacteristics: \nAnalytical, Observant, Loyal\nStrain:\n\nFor the quietly observant Virgo, Space Queen is a hybrid that will help you out of your shell and make you feel relaxed and comfortable.

You\u2019ll be the life of the party, albeit from the luxurious comfort of a reclined position on a comfy couch. You get the best of both worlds with a soothing dose of pain relief to boot.\nPisces\n\nDates:\nFebruary 9 \u2013 March 20\nCharacteristics: \nCompassionate, Imaginative, Escapist\nStrain:\n\nThis strain is one of the best for bonding with friends. Pure Power Plant offers a warm, clear-headed euphoria that\u2019s both uplifting and relaxing. Any leftover stress from your day will dissolve into psychedelic giggles and get you grooving to the music. Keep your eye drops handy, though \u2013 red eyes abound!",

            "text": "They make\u00a0us smile, they make us laugh, they make us stop mid-sentence and say, \"Wait. What?\" The Leafly Strain Review Hall of Fame has made its glorious comeback to celebrate the very best of your cannabis-fueled quirkiness. Yes, we take elevating the cannabis conversation seriously and we want to show the world that the cannabis community is comprised of mature, responsible individuals\u2026but we can all share a harmless chuckle every once in a while, too.\nSo sit back, grab your favorite strain, and marvel at the amazing(ly hilarious) places our minds can sometimes go with a little help from our green friend.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Purple Haze\nFrom the producers that brought you Hermit Crab Hotbox\u00a0comes the\u00a0true\u00a0story of a lost\u00a0adventurer and his unlikely crawdad friend. A compelling tale of love and loss.\n\nTook me from down in the dumps to having a cool time. Went on an adventure and found a crawdad. I subsequently made friends with said crawdad and hung out with him. Man I miss Craymond.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0XJ-13\nBecause butts are funny.\n\nAt one point i had tingling feelings in my butt. Great for hanging out.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Pure Power Plant\nYikes. At least Pure Power Plant was nice. (Also, we hope the scorpion made bail.)\n\nUsually when I get stung by a scorpion, I capture them and make them kill themselves by circling them with lighter fluid and then lighting it so they sting themselves in the back. Smoking pure power plant helped me to understand that scorpions aren't inherently aggressive creatures, they're just defending themselves according to their genetic patterns. I took him out to a field behind my house and was going to let him go but a cop stopped me and arrested me due to a warrant and now he's sitting in a small jar with my other personal belongings at the county jail pending my trial date next month :/ Pure power plant was nice.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Juicy Fruit\nThree profound questions that we may never have the answers to. May Juicy Fruit one day help us unlock these mysteries.\n\nJesus\u2026is he real\u2026will we ever be able to see\u2026how the kids see the taste of cinnamon toast crunch\u2026or are frosted flakes better\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Master Jedi\nFriends are there to love and support you,\u00a0to pick you up off the ground when the going gets rough. And to point out when you're unable\u00a0to accurately interpret reality.\n\nThis got me so high that I was convinced that the street light outside my house was the moon. Luckily my friend pointed out that \"that's no moon.\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Afghan Kush\nI would judge, except I think we've all been that guy with a dog bed hat at some point in our lives.\n\nSmoked this shit and I was walking in tunnels made of rainbows and then proceeded to have a chocolate bar fight while wearing dog beds as hats in a London [drugstore]\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Purple Trainwreck\n\"The greatest pillow fort in all the land.\"\n\nI learned how to make the greatest pillow fort in all the land. No girls allowed, just me and my dog Jack (to be fair he came up with the password so I had to let him in).\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Green Crack\nBecause no one has ever\u00a0described the munchies better than this wordsmith.\n\nI get really hungry every time I smoke this. Like really hungry. Like whole left side of the taco bell menu hungry.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Maui Waui\nSome feats just deserve an entire chicken's worth of credit.\n\nSmoked a bowl of this and got inspired enough to clean my entire house. I felt incredibly accomplished and rewarded myself by eating a whole chicken.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Platinum Bubba Kush\nToday's lesson in sharing is brought to you by\u00a0Platinum Bubba and the color purple.\n\nGreat floral taste and some of the strongest munchies ever. While we were on this strain, my friend asked if he could have some of the pizza I was making and I said no. I realized later that my munchies were so strong that I was not thinking rationally and of course split the pizza with him\u2026and another. Make sure you have some Red Baron pizzas standing by in the freezer.\n\nPhoto credit: Kevin O'Mara via Flickr CC",

    "description": "<p>If you&rsquo;re searching for a potent sativa, Pure Power Plant may be the strain for you. Featuring a musky, citrus smell, this strain is fairly pungent and skunk-like. Great for daytime, Pure Power Plant produces a clear-headed sensation while causing a pleasant, gentle pressure in the face and head. As this strain is not a pure sativa, however, some indica effects shine through, especially after heavy use. Too much Pure Power Plant may put you to sleep or leave you stuck on the couch.
