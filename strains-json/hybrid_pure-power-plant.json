What?\" The Leafly Strain Review Hall of Fame has made its glorious comeback to celebrate the very best of your cannabis-fueled quirkiness. Yes, we take elevating the cannabis conversation seriously and we want to show the world that the cannabis community is comprised of mature, responsible individuals…but we can all share a harmless chuckle every once in a while, too.\nSo sit back, grab your favorite strain, and marvel at the amazing(ly hilarious) places our minds can sometimes go with a little help from our green friend. \n   Purple Haze\nFrom the producers that brought you Hermit Crab Hotbox comes the true story of a lost adventurer and his unlikely crawdad friend. A compelling tale of love and loss.\n\nTook me from down in the dumps to having a cool time. Went on an adventure and found a crawdad. I subsequently made friends with said crawdad and hung out with him. Man I miss Craymond.\n\n   XJ-13\nBecause butts are funny.\n\nAt one point i had tingling feelings in my butt. Great for hanging out.\n\n   Pure Power Plant\nYikes. At least Pure Power Plant was nice. (Also, we hope the scorpion made bail.)\n\nUsually when I get stung by a scorpion, I capture them and make them kill themselves by circling them with lighter fluid and then lighting it so they sting themselves in the back. Smoking pure power plant helped me to understand that scorpions aren\u0027t inherently aggressive creatures, they\u0027re just defending themselves according to their genetic patterns. I took him out to a field behind my house and was going to let him go but a cop stopped me and arrested me due to a warrant and now he\u0027s sitting in a small jar with my other personal belongings at the county jail pending my trial date next month :/ Pure power plant was nice.\n\n   Juicy Fruit\nThree profound questions that we may never have the answers to. May Juicy Fruit one day help us unlock these mysteries.\n\nJesus…is he real…will we ever be able to see…how the kids see the taste of cinnamon toast crunch…or are frosted flakes better\n\n   Master Jedi\nFriends are there to love and support you, to pick you up off the ground when the going gets rough. And to point out when you\u0027re unable to accurately interpret reality.\n\nThis got me so high that I was convinced that the street light outside my house was the moon. Luckily my friend pointed out that \"that\u0027s no moon.\"\n\n   Afghan Kush\nI would judge, except I think we\u0027ve all been that guy with a dog bed hat at some point in our lives.\n\nSmoked this shit and I was walking in tunnels made of rainbows and then proceeded to have a chocolate bar fight while wearing dog beds as hats in a London [drugstore]\n\n   Purple Trainwreck\n\"The greatest pillow fort in all the land.\"\n\nI learned how to make the greatest pillow fort in all the land. No girls allowed, just me and my dog Jack (to be fair he came up with the password so I had to let him in).\n\n   Green Crack\nBecause no one has ever described the munchies better than this wordsmith.\n\nI get really hungry every time I smoke this. Like really hungry. Like whole left side of the taco bell menu hungry.\n\n   Maui Waui\nSome feats just deserve an entire chicken\u0027s worth of credit.\n\nSmoked a bowl of this and got inspired enough to clean my entire house. I felt incredibly accomplished and rewarded myself by eating a whole chicken.\n\n   Platinum Bubba Kush\nToday\u0027s lesson in sharing is brought to you by Platinum Bubba and the color purple.\n\nGreat floral taste and some of the strongest munchies ever. While we were on this strain, my friend asked if he could have some of the pizza I was making and I said no. I realized later that my munchies were so strong that I was not thinking rationally and of course split the pizza with him…and another. Make sure you have some Red Baron pizzas standing by in the freezer.\n\nPhoto credit: Kevin O\u0027Mara via Flickr CC","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12002845/the-leafly-strain-review-hall-of-fame-we-miss-craymond-too.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/the-leafly-strain-review-hall-of-fame-we-miss-craymond-too"}],"reviewCount":229,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":108.46430669800235},{"name":"Nutty","score":102.59621034077556},{"name":"Butter","score":100.08445945945945},{"name":"Pear","score":100},{"name":"Earthy","score":9.8156580493537}],"effects":[{"name":"Talkative","score":112.66524676850764},{"name":"Focused","score":111.84268507638073},{"name":"Energetic","score":25.92170975323149},{"name":"Happy","score":22.671856639247942},{"name":"Relaxed","score":18.955640423031728}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":15.114571092831962},{"name":"Depression","score":10.660252643948295},{"name":"Pain","score":7.8951233842538189},{"name":"Fatigue","score":4.0320211515863686},{"name":"Headaches","score":3.5252643948296121}],"conditions":[{"name":"PTSD","score":5.2768801410105759},{"name":"Anxiety","score":5.1520270270270272},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":2.8495887191539362},{"name":"PMS","score":2.6806698002350178},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":2.6806698002350178}],"negatives":[{"name":"Headache","score":103.18742655699178},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":11.927144535840188},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":11.335928319623971},{"name":"Paranoid","score":4.2853995299647476},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.435810810810811}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_6499.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001550/b/pure-power-plant__primary_c9bd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_f589.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/671570/b/pure-power-plant__primary_ef8f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_81a6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/650353/b/pure-power-plant__primary_1845.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_1eff.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/646358/b/pure-power-plant__primary_df4d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_9aed.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/642704/b/pure-power-plant__primary_0da2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_0a24.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/639414/b/pure-power-plant__primary_f85e.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":137,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Bellingham, WA","Breedsville, MI","Cashmere, WA","Colorado Springs, CO","Detroit, MI","East Wenatchee, WA","Englewood, CO","Everett, WA","Freeland, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/pure-power-plant","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.35371179039301/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"African","subtitle":null,"slug":"african","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/african","symbol":"Afr","applink":"leafly://strain/african"},{"name":"North American Indica","subtitle":null,"slug":"north-american","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/north-american","symbol":"Nam","applink":"leafly://strain/north-american"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":63,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Like whole left side of the taco bell menu hungry.\n\n   Maui Waui\nSome feats just deserve an entire chicken\u0027s worth of credit.\n\nSmoked a bowl of this and got inspired enough to clean my entire house. I felt incredibly accomplished and rewarded myself by eating a whole chicken.\n\n   Platinum Bubba Kush\nToday\u0027s lesson in sharing is brought to you by Platinum Bubba and the color purple.\n\nGreat floral taste and some of the strongest munchies ever. While we were on this strain, my friend asked if he could have some of the pizza I was making and I said no. I realized later that my munchies were so strong that I was not thinking rationally and of course split the pizza with him…and another. Make sure you have some Red Baron pizzas standing by in the freezer.\n\nPhoto credit: Kevin O\u0027Mara via Flickr CC","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12002845/the-leafly-strain-review-hall-of-fame-we-miss-craymond-too.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/the-leafly-strain-review-hall-of-fame-we-miss-craymond-too"}],"reviewCount":229,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":108.46430669800235},{"name":"Nutty","score":102.59621034077556},{"name":"Butter","score":100.08445945945945},{"name":"Pear","score":100},{"name":"Earthy","score":9.8156580493537}],"effects":[{"name":"Talkative","score":112.66524676850764},{"name":"Focused","score":111.84268507638073},{"name":"Energetic","score":25.92170975323149},{"name":"Happy","score":22.671856639247942},{"name":"Relaxed","score":18.955640423031728}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":15.114571092831962},{"name":"Depression","score":10.660252643948295},{"name":"Pain","score":7.8951233842538189},{"name":"Fatigue","score":4.0320211515863686},{"name":"Headaches","score":3.5252643948296121}],"conditions":[{"name":"PTSD","score":5.2768801410105759},{"name":"Anxiety","score":5.1520270270270272},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":2.8495887191539362},{"name":"PMS","score":2.6806698002350178},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":2.6806698002350178}],"negatives":[{"name":"Headache","score":103.18742655699178},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":11.927144535840188},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":11.335928319623971},{"name":"Paranoid","score":4.2853995299647476},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.435810810810811}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_6499.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001550/b/pure-power-plant__primary_c9bd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_f589.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/671570/b/pure-power-plant__primary_ef8f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_81a6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/650353/b/pure-power-plant__primary_1845.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_1eff.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/646358/b/pure-power-plant__primary_df4d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_9aed.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/642704/b/pure-power-plant__primary_0da2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pure-power-plant_100x100_0a24.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/639414/b/pure-power-plant__primary_f85e.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":137,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Bellingham, WA","Breedsville, MI","Cashmere, WA","Colorado Springs, CO","Detroit, MI","East Wenatchee, WA","Englewood, CO","Everett, WA","Freeland, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/pure-power-plant","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.35371179039301/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"African","subtitle":null,"slug":"african","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/african","symbol":"Afr","applink":"leafly://strain/african"},{"name":"North American Indica","subtitle":null,"slug":"north-american","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/north-american","symbol":"Nam","applink":"leafly://strain/north-american"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":63,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

That said, have you ever wondered which cannabis strain best reflects your astrological sign? We were curious so we took it upon ourselves to pair up the best strains that complement each personality type based on their horoscope sign.\nWhether you’re as stubborn as a ram, as dramatic as a lion, or as balanced as a scale, we’ve got a strain for you! So sit back, relax, and watch your stars and strains align.\nAries\n\nDates: \nMarch 21 – April 19\nCharacteristics: \nEnthusiastic, Energetic, Independent\nCannabis Strain: \n\nThis sativa-dominant strain will quell any unpleasant feelings with a soothing euphoric boost.

A hybrid blend, GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) (and its many descendants) are sure to put a smile on your face and bring you peace and relaxation. This is the strain you’ll want for when you’re looking to laugh until you giggle-snort (and then laugh some more).\nLeo\n\nDates: \nJuly 23 – August 22\nCharacteristics: \nConfident, Dramatic, Enthusiastic\nStrain:\n\nAdmittedly, you’re a drama queen, but this strain is guaranteed to lessen the drama and up the ante with joy. Your verbal skills fall dormant and allow someone else to take the spotlight for a change, while you will find yourself quietly in awe at the beauty of the world. Pineapple Express is a freight train that runs on euphoria – all aboard!\nVirgo\n\nDates: \nAugust 23 – September 22\nCharacteristics: \nAnalytical, Observant, Loyal\nStrain:\n\nFor the quietly observant Virgo, Space Queen is a hybrid that will help you out of your shell and make you feel relaxed and comfortable.

A perfect match for your adventurous soul, this strain rocks a super high THC content that will blow you out of this world and gear you up for a cosmic journey through space and time (or maybe just an epic hike).\nCapricorn\n\nDates: \nDecember 22 – January 19\nCharacteristics: \nResourceful, Organized, Disciplined\nStrain:\n\nMother’s Helper is perfect for your inner coordinator as it swirls creativity through your mind. Your organizational urges will be appeased with a supremely satisfying sativa burst of energy, followed by a happy mellow cool-down as you survey your accomplishments with pride.\nAquarius\n\nDates:\nJanuary 20 – February 18\nCharacteristics: \nWitty, Clever, Inventive\nStrain: \n\nBlue Diamond will help you exercise your funny bone, with happy giggles and witty repartee galore.

You get the best of both worlds with a soothing dose of pain relief to boot.\nPisces\n\nDates:\nFebruary 9 – March 20\nCharacteristics: \nCompassionate, Imaginative, Escapist\nStrain:\n\nThis strain is one of the best for bonding with friends. Pure Power Plant offers a warm, clear-headed euphoria that’s both uplifting and relaxing. Any leftover stress from your day will dissolve into psychedelic giggles and get you grooving to the music.

What?\" The Leafly Strain Review Hall of Fame has made its glorious comeback to celebrate the very best of your cannabis-fueled quirkiness. Yes, we take elevating the cannabis conversation seriously and we want to show the world that the cannabis community is comprised of mature, responsible individuals…but we can all share a harmless chuckle every once in a while, too.\nSo sit back, grab your favorite strain, and marvel at the amazing(ly hilarious) places our minds can sometimes go with a little help from our green friend. \n   Purple Haze\nFrom the producers that brought you Hermit Crab Hotbox comes the true story of a lost adventurer and his unlikely crawdad friend. A compelling tale of love and loss.\n\nTook me from down in the dumps to having a cool time. Went on an adventure and found a crawdad. I subsequently made friends with said crawdad and hung out with him. Man I miss Craymond.\n\n   XJ-13\nBecause butts are funny.\n\nAt one point i had tingling feelings in my butt. Great for hanging out.\n\n   Pure Power Plant\nYikes. At least Pure Power Plant was nice. (Also, we hope the scorpion made bail.)\n\nUsually when I get stung by a scorpion, I capture them and make them kill themselves by circling them with lighter fluid and then lighting it so they sting themselves in the back. Smoking pure power plant helped me to understand that scorpions aren\u0027t inherently aggressive creatures, they\u0027re just defending themselves according to their genetic patterns. I took him out to a field behind my house and was going to let him go but a cop stopped me and arrested me due to a warrant and now he\u0027s sitting in a small jar with my other personal belongings at the county jail pending my trial date next month :/ Pure power plant was nice.\n\n   Juicy Fruit\nThree profound questions that we may never have the answers to. May Juicy Fruit one day help us unlock these mysteries.\n\nJesus…is he real…will we ever be able to see…how the kids see the taste of cinnamon toast crunch…or are frosted flakes better\n\n   Master Jedi\nFriends are there to love and support you, to pick you up off the ground when the going gets rough. And to point out when you\u0027re unable to accurately interpret reality.\n\nThis got me so high that I was convinced that the street light outside my house was the moon. Luckily my friend pointed out that \"that\u0027s no moon.\"\n\n   Afghan Kush\nI would judge, except I think we\u0027ve all been that guy with a dog bed hat at some point in our lives.\n\nSmoked this shit and I was walking in tunnels made of rainbows and then proceeded to have a chocolate bar fight while wearing dog beds as hats in a London [drugstore]\n\n   Purple Trainwreck\n\"The greatest pillow fort in all the land.\"\n\nI learned how to make the greatest pillow fort in all the land. No girls allowed, just me and my dog Jack (to be fair he came up with the password so I had to let him in).\n\n   Green Crack\nBecause no one has ever described the munchies better than this wordsmith.\n\nI get really hungry every time I smoke this. Like really hungry. Like whole left side of the taco bell menu hungry.\n\n   Maui Waui\nSome feats just deserve an entire chicken\u0027s worth of credit.\n\nSmoked a bowl of this and got inspired enough to clean my entire house. I felt incredibly accomplished and rewarded myself by eating a whole chicken.\n\n   Platinum Bubba Kush\nToday\u0027s lesson in sharing is brought to you by Platinum Bubba and the color purple.\n\nGreat floral taste and some of the strongest munchies ever. While we were on this strain, my friend asked if he could have some of the pizza I was making and I said no. I realized later that my munchies were so strong that I was not thinking rationally and of course split the pizza with him…and another.
