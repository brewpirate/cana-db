            "text": "Wow. For someone who prefers a sativa, Purple Alien OG is one of my all time favorite strains. A couple hits of this heavy hitter will leave you feeling so relaxed and at ease. Depending on what I am doing I can either get major couch lock or be just fine being active. The key is it amplifies whatever you were all ready doing. So sitting on the couch smoking a bowl of PAO and you'll be stuck there all night. Smoking a duby of PAO  out on a hike and you'll enjoy a very nice active high. Definitely gave her a 5. Would love to grow this strain. If you get the chance give it a shot. But note it is definitely a heavy hitter and may put you on your ass. And that cannabis can effect everyone differently and this is just my experience. Happy smoking !\u270c\ufe0f\ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude18\n",

Both looks and tastes amazing: smells/tastes like a mix of berry and og, with a surprising (delicious) citrus aftertaste.
