The first time I tried Purple Arrow I had nerve pains shooting down my neck into my upper back. After the first drag the pain was gone, and I could still function at about 90%. Everything else I've tried hits so fricking hard I can't even think. With G.G. or P.A. I can spend time enjoying the smoking aspect of medicating and still make it back into the house to help out in the kitchen. I gave the strength rating of 9 because it kicked the shit out of my pain, not by how buzzed I got.",
