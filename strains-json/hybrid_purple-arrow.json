I have pain, I don\u0027t need to feel f*cked up, I need relief. The first time I tried Purple Arrow I had nerve pains shooting down my neck into my upper back. After the first drag the pain was gone, and I could still function at about 90%. Everything else I\u0027ve tried hits so fricking hard I can\u0027t even think. With G.G. or P.A. I can spend time enjoying the smoking aspect of medicating and still make it back into the house to help out in the kitchen. I gave the strength rating of 9 because it kicked the shit out of my pain, not by how buzzed I got.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1623981,"username":"candide.weed","text":"it will set you straight and always hits it\u0027s mark","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":97,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":54.0650406504065},{"name":"Pine","score":51.829268292682926},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":51.6260162601626},{"name":"Woody","score":50.609756097560975},{"name":"Sweet","score":2.8455284552845526}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":59.552845528455286},{"name":"Relaxed","score":59.552845528455286},{"name":"Happy","score":59.349593495934961},{"name":"Focused","score":55.081300813008127},{"name":"Creative","score":54.8780487804878}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":12.195121951219512},{"name":"Stress","score":9.34959349593496},{"name":"Depression","score":5.6910569105691051},{"name":"Headaches","score":3.4552845528455287},{"name":"Nausea","score":3.4552845528455287}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":7.9268292682926829},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":2.0325203252032518},{"name":"PTSD","score":2.0325203252032518},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.8292682926829267},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.8292682926829267}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":56.50406504065041},{"name":"Headache","score":50.8130081300813},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.4552845528455287},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.8292682926829267},{"name":"Paranoid","score":0.81300813008130091}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-arrow_100x100_623a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/537208/b/purple-arrow__primary_1d47.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-arrow_100x100_5419.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/537207/b/purple-arrow__primary_4b43.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-arrow_100x100_3085.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/504459/b/purple-arrow__primary_6c07.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-arrow_100x100_8038.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/496825/b/purple-arrow__primary_d926.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-arrow_100x100_a876.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/418413/b/purple-arrow__primary_2e7b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-arrow_100x100_90b3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/377920/b/purple-arrow__primary_e7ea.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":19,"popularCities":["Bellingham, WA","Renton, WA","Seattle, WA","Spanaway, WA","Spokane, WA","Tacoma, WA","Airway Heights, WA","Arlington, WA","Bellevue, WA","Bothell, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-arrow","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.22680412371134/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
