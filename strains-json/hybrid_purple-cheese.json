Good sedating, but don\u0027t expect to do shit. Seriously. This is night time weed. A highbred, but hits like a full Indica with steam behind it.

I just smoked a 3 gram blunt (Fronto tobacco leaf wrap) and it is a joy to taste and smell. So much so that I will pop some in the Pax 3 later, even though I rarely use it for flower anymore.  One definitely notices some heavy body effects, perhaps due to the higher CBD content?  Regardless, this is an exotic strain for the connoisseur! I would call this pretty close to 50/50 Hybrid, perhaps a bit more Indica. The buds are very well manicured with lots of caramel colored hairs throughout. Lots of crystals, cheesy smell but it’s not like Blue Cheese, it’s more mellow and less funky. Quite an herbal flavor, with a nice nutty finish. Pick it up if you can...4.75 stars.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/ZtQxS6XT_MjOwMadRkRsU9ZNU-I=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fX2q7eTOS7WxMAnwrLSBM_wide-brim-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3273","title":"New Strains Alert: Drizella, Star Berry Indica, Big Sur Holy Bud, Dream Police, and Purple Cheese","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1412362800000)\/","text":"Thanks to all the Leafly users who submitted strain nominations this week! Our strain database now exceeds 1,000 varieties, but our collection is far from finished so keep the suggestions coming. Drizella, Star Berry Indica, Big Sur Holy Bud, Dream Police, and Purple Cheese are only a few among many newly added varieties, so don\u0027t forget to check out all of the other newcomers in the strain Explorer!\n   1.
