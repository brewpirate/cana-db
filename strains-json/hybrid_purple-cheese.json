            "text": "I have yet to give a perfect rating but Purple Cheese comes pretty close. I just smoked a 3 gram blunt (Fronto tobacco leaf wrap) and it is a joy to taste and smell. So much so that I will pop some in the Pax 3 later, even though I rarely use it for flower anymore.  One definitely notices some heavy body effects, perhaps due to the higher CBD content?  Regardless, this is an exotic strain for the connoisseur! I would call this pretty close to 50/50 Hybrid, perhaps a bit more Indica. The buds are very well manicured with lots of caramel colored hairs throughout. Lots of crystals, cheesy smell but it\u2019s not like Blue Cheese, it\u2019s more mellow and less funky. Quite an herbal flavor, with a nice nutty finish. Pick it up if you can...4.75 stars.",
