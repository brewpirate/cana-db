The buds were very fluffy and dark purple (There was almost no green on these buds) with long dark orange hairs. The smell? Heaven? It actually smelled quite like diesely berries.. But It was heavenly nonetheless! The high was perfect. Very heady and happy. Also a very creative strain! Overall I give this strain a 4.5/5 - Medicinally good for Stress, Depression, and Fatigue",
