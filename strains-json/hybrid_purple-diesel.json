Sour D being one of my favorite strains I knew that whatever the Purple cross was I would enjoy it. The buds were very fluffy and dark purple (There was almost no green on these buds) with long dark orange hairs. The smell? Heaven? It actually smelled quite like diesely berries.. But It was heavenly nonetheless! The high was perfect. Very heady and happy. Also a very creative strain! Overall I give this strain a 4.5/5 - Medicinally good for Stress, Depression, and Fatigue","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1632224,"username":"Stephen40577","text":"It’s a very enjoyful time, you first feel very euphoric and happy with everything around you, then you start relaxing more and more  and feel very comfortable with the environments around you.
