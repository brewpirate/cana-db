Buds were covered in trichomes and lighter green with purple undertones and lite fox tailing, all signs of awesome genetics and a great grow system. I\u0027m usually not an Indica Guy, sativa and hybrid are usually my cup of tea but this settles my stomach and helped clear my head from all my stress. While this isn\u0027t my favorite strain from RD, I\u0027d put it right up there with Purple Swish and Rare Darkness for taste and similarity. Made me feel super floaty, a little heavier then the other indica\u0027s there especially behind my eyes. ;) blind me with dental floss.\n","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":23,"flavors":[{"name":"Flowery","score":25},{"name":"Earthy","score":17.12962962962963},{"name":"Berry","score":15.277777777777779},{"name":"Grape","score":14.351851851851851},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":13.425925925925926}],"effects":[{"name":"Sleepy","score":37.037037037037038},{"name":"Euphoric","score":34.25925925925926},{"name":"Relaxed","score":34.25925925925926},{"name":"Happy","score":20.833333333333332},{"name":"Tingly","score":18.981481481481481}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Insomnia","score":32.407407407407405},{"name":"Stress","score":19.907407407407405},{"name":"Depression","score":17.12962962962963},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":17.12962962962963},{"name":"Nausea","score":16.203703703703702}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":18.981481481481481},{"name":"Arthritis","score":13.425925925925926},{"name":"Anorexia","score":12.5},{"name":"PTSD","score":12.5},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":12.5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":19.907407407407405},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.8518518518518516},{"name":"Headache","score":0.92592592592592582}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-hashplant_100x100_5e19.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002491/b/purple-hashplant__primary_5ad4.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-hashplant_100x100_e305.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/599562/b/purple-hashplant__primary_acce.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-hashplant_100x100_dba8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/479028/b/purple-hashplant__primary_3010.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-hashplant_100x100_e0cb.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/238954/b/purple-hashplant__primary_b0a2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-hashplant_100x100_2f62.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/166859/b/purple-hashplant_825x550_64f0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-hashplant_100x100_4af1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/60684/b/purple-hashplant_825x550_67dd.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":14,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Eugene, OR","Gresham, OR","Sweet Home, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-hashplant","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.21739130434783/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
