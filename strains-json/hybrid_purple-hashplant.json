            "text": "Amazing, this was the last strain I needed to try from Rare Dankness, House of Dankness in Denver.. sweet taste and smell, definitely floral tones and that \"purple\" berry taste. Buds were covered in trichomes and lighter green with purple undertones and lite fox tailing, all signs of awesome genetics and a great grow system. I'm usually not an Indica Guy, sativa and hybrid are usually my cup of tea but this settles my stomach and helped clear my head from all my stress. While this isn't my favorite strain from RD, I'd put it right up there with Purple Swish and Rare Darkness for taste and similarity. Made me feel super floaty, a little heavier then the other indica's there especially behind my eyes. ;) blind me with dental floss.\n",
