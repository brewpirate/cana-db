            "text": "Structurally it's very sativa like with long, thinner but still dense buds. It's flavor is very sweet and unlike any other strain I've tried. Honey like is the closest flavor I could put it at. Effects wise it doesn't hit the same notes as other sativa dominant hybrids but rather behaves like an indica without the extra coma like symptoms. It's a very relaxed, not anxiety inducing kind of feeling. Most suitable for a nice evening toke post dinner (or pre if you like to eat after) because I became very hungry after.",
