The taste is with pine flavor with a aroma of citrus. A very powerful mind sedative for any conditions. The tricones on the bud where nice and white with large white crystals that can be seen from the plan of your hand. THC was around 16% which sound pretty darn great for a smoke session any day.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/ZtQxS6XT_MjOwMadRkRsU9ZNU-I=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fX2q7eTOS7WxMAnwrLSBM_wide-brim-green.png"},{"id":1607206,"username":"Kooterbrown","text":"Hit me like a Sativa.
