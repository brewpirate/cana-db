This is my favourite weed ive tried and id say i try about 2 new ones a week to put it in perspective for you. The bud its self impressed me with its like 99-1 purple to green ratio.. a very  attractive bud as well to me needs distinct hairs which this strain also has plenty of. For taste, honestly not the best but above average for sure. Last but not least the smell was very punget yet also a bit sweet and thats what i like but i know some people dont care lol. Anyways if you see this dont hesitate to pick it up (i bought a half oz for 110$ but id honestly spend a lot more if i needed to)",
