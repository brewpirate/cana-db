    "description": "<p>Purple Voodoo is one of those true hybrids that is a nearly 50/50 mix of sativa and indica from its Double Purple Doja, Purple Urkle, and Purple Diesel heritage. These plants will flower in 8-10 weeks and will produce dark flowers with traces of purple and red. Its purpleness is evident in its pungent taste and smell, which has a musky quality tinged with grapey sweetness. Since it was bred in California, warm climates or indoors are best for growing (just be aware of the strong smell). As a good mix, this strain boasts both high THC and especially high CBD levels, making it a popular medicinal strain. The high also has a balanced feeling that is both clear and relaxing.</p>\n",

            "text": "Okay. Coming across quality thai strains are like christmas for me, and this is like that one \"big\" present hidden behind the tree just when you think you didn't get what you \"really\" wanted that year. Its that good. Thai (purple, I hear) x AK47. Seriously a kick to the head that has every orifice in your head dripping but in that, \"good god, this is what cannabis should be like\" sort of way. VERY heavy, very intense head high that does segue nicely down through your body. Tends to linger in the groinal area, too- sex was Amazing for my girl and i, as we both found this plant to have several aphrodisiac qualities. Small warning, however: try to go in with a good mindset and you will be rewarded greatly. Negative vibes however, do not lend themselves well as the insensity only amplifies every last thing your feeling. Feeling down? Grab a bowl or two, your lady, a movie and laugh, love and be merry. Lifes too short. Fuck already. -Father Dope. ",
