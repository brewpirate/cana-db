Smell is very uniquely sweet smelling, grape scent, just over all amazing my favorite smelling. \n\nHas a very enjoyable high, feel really good and relaxed with a good bit energy to get things done but relaxing enough for night use. Has a strong spacey feeling that feels like your floating on a cloud. feeling with excellent amount of pain relief. \n\nBud was pure purple, looked beautiful. \n\nGood strain probably one of my more favorite strains.
