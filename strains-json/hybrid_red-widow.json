A grinder really isn\u0027t necessary. Just squeeze a couple nice fluffy buds, and it breaks up perfectly to roll or load a bowl. The buds have A LOT of crystals, and I was lucky enough to of got the pick of the litter when it came to my supply, resulting in LARGE, well manicured Nuggs. More of a Sativa High, in my opinion. Lasting usually 2-3 hours. Sweet smelling bud with earthy undertones. Light green to Dark green buds with deep red/orange hairs throughout. Nice overall smoke, tasting earthy, with a lil diesel, yet sweet.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":9,"flavors":[{"name":"Tropical","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Skunk","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Butter","score":2.2727272727272729}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":9.0909090909090917},{"name":"Uplifted","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Energetic","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Focused","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Giggly","score":4.5454545454545459}],"symptoms":[],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Anxiety","score":2.2727272727272729}],"negatives":[{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.2727272727272729}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/red-widow","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3.22222222222222/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Red Dragon","subtitle":null,"slug":"red-dragon","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/red-dragon","symbol":"Red","applink":"leafly://strain/red-dragon"},{"name":"White Widow","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-widow","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow","symbol":"Ww","applink":"leafly://strain/white-widow"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
