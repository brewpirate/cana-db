THERE'S MORE!!!\nGenetics gone madd is one of the most affordable seed breeders around. \nIf you suffer from chronic and or nerve pain sleep disorders and or PTSD you really owe it to yourself to check out generics gone madd",

This brought down her joint and nerve pain significantly as well as her ongoing headaches. As a hybrid indica dominate with 17% CBD. The CBD does wonders for her nerve pain and any other neurological issues she has. The dispensary was out of Harley Quinn and we tried this instead and I'm pleasantly surprised",
