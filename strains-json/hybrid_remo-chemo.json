Adored for its high THC content, Remo Chemo also offers a Kush-forward <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/terpenes-the-flavors-of-cannabis-aromatherapy\">terpene profile</a> that contains aromas of earth, gas, and pepper. As the name might suggest, Remo Chemo is adept at assisting with side effects of chemotherapy by stimulating appetite, reducing nausea, and curbing pain. &nbsp;</p>\n",
