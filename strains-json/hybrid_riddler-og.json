But before Jessica Jones grit, Aquaman hype, and the umpteenth Spider-Man reboot, we had the Caped Crusader, a Dark Knight who’s been keeping the streets of Gotham safe since 1939.\nOver the ensuing decades, Batman would battle Jokers, Penguins, and, at one point, Floronic Man, who had the ability to accelerate plant growth thanks to his advanced knowledge of botany (sounds like a “sea of green” grower to me). While we don’t know for sure that this Gotham baddie with the green thumb was pro-cannabis, we can’t imagine a better way to celebrate Batman’s storied history and enduring pop culture relevance than by pondering which Batman-themed cannabis strains and products could win over Floronic Man, Poison Ivy, and even the Caped Crusader himself (because even Batman suffers from aches and pains).\nEnjoy this roundup of items that may cause you to utter, “Holy smokes, Batman!\nBatman-Themed Cannabis Products and Accessories\nBatman Etched Glass Stash Jar\n\nThis stash jar from Etsy is a cheeky way to store your favorite nugs or edibles, especially if you’re an old school Adam West-era Batman fan.\nPrice: $24.99 plus shipping\nBatman Grinder\n\nGrind up your bud of choice with this subtle black and silver 4-tier grinder featuring the Bat logo emblazoned across the top.\nPrice: $19.84\nBatgirl Cowl\n\nDoes this Batgirl cowl have anything to do with cannabis?

This amped combination offers consumers a vigorous body buzz that is clear-headed and motivating, encouraging physical activity in or outside. Harness the mental clarity of this strain at lower doses and the fueled-up stimulation with continued use.\n   Harlequin (Harley Quinn)\nHarlequin is a 75/25 sativa-dominant strain renowned for its reliable expression of CBD. A descendant of Colombian Gold, a Nepali indica, and Thai and Swiss landrace strains, you can depend on Harlequin to provide clear-headed, alert sativa effects. Unlike most high-CBD strains, Harlequin almost always develops a CBD:THC ratio of 5:2, making this strain one of the most effective out there for treatment of pain and anxiety, as CBD can counteract THC’s paranoia while amplifying its painkilling properties. Flavors can range from earthy musk to sweet mango, but without a doubt, what draws crowds to Harlequin is its ability to relax without sedation and to relieve without intoxication.\n   Batman OG\nBatman OG, named for the Caped Crusader of the DC Universe, is a potent indica that hits the body like POW!
