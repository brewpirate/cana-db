It’s creative, relaxing, social, not sleep inducing.  Thank the nature mamma and weed nerds for figuring out how to make a perfectly balanced indica dominant strain.  I could smoke this to meditate, to go out dancing, to draw, to write emails, to wander around in the woods.  I can’t really think of a situation where I wouldn’t want to feel how this makes me feel...that’s like true love, right?  oh...maybe not a work..there’s a situation.  Anyways, in summary, my body felt great and my mind felt focused, clear, and creative.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1633377,"username":"Mimithehamham","text":"I got a gram of ripped bubba extract yesterday.
