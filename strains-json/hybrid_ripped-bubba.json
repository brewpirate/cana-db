Thank the nature mamma and weed nerds for figuring out how to make a perfectly balanced indica dominant strain.  I could smoke this to meditate, to go out dancing, to draw, to write emails, to wander around in the woods.  I can\u2019t really think of a situation where I wouldn\u2019t want to feel how this makes me feel...that\u2019s like true love, right?  oh...maybe not a work..there\u2019s a situation.  Anyways, in summary, my body felt great and my mind felt focused, clear, and creative.",

After not being physically active much due to working on a computer all day (and a deep love of crispy pork) i played tennis a lot last week and dug a hole in clay (digging i havent done much in a long time). As a result of being out of shape i was mad sore. I woke up all night with pain, ripped a couple dabs of ripped bubba, and I went straight from anxious, stressed, depressed, and sinus infected with so much pain, to sitting here on my phone writing this review because this strain actually makes me feel more optimistic than usual and i feel compelled to share my experience.
