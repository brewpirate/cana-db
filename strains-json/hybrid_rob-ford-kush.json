Buddha\u0027s Hand\n\nBuddha’s Hand is a sativa-dominant strain that was bred by combining genetics from Lemon Thai and Snow Lotus. Pungent aromas of citrus and wildflowers burst from the dense, trichome-caked buds. Easing stress without the cost of energy, Buddha’s Hand is your perfect daytime companion when you’re in need of a mood boost or focus.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Buddha\u0027s Hand\n \n   2. Locomotion\n\nLocomotion is a 70/30 indica-dominant strain by Heroes of the Farm. A cross between Blue Diesel and Timewreck, this strain delivers a dreamy cerebral high while soothing the body. Locomotion’s sour-smelling buds bloom with deep hues of silvery purple. Novices take caution with this potent indica: a little bit goes a long way.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Locomotion\n \n   3. Rob Ford Kush\n\nA Toronto strain that gets its name from its sensationalized former mayor, Rob Ford Kush is a powerfully sleepy indica strain.

Jacked-Up\n\nOriginally bred by Heroes of the Farm, Jacked-Up is a 60/40 sativa-dominant hybrid cross between Jack Herer and Timewreck. It typically provides strong cerebral, uplifting effects ideal for daytime use. These resin-packed flowers boast a spicy, woody aroma with intricate undertones of berry, citrus, peaches, and apricots.
