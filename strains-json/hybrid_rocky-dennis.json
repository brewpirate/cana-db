The inhale produces an immediate smile and the exhale leaves you wanting another taste immediately.\n\nEffects: Joy, giggles, euphoria that last quite a while, followed by blissful relaxation. Great for depression, pain relief, and in higher doses, insomnia.\n\nI\u0027ve only found this strain once, but hopefully more farms will grow it and it\u0027s reputation will spread far and wide.\n\n10/10","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1640696,"username":"MeliMed","text":"Great flavor (tastes piney \u0026 lemony), good buzz, relaxing, will have you couch locked ;-)","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/NTZWcqUfxa-YuBR-9klecDuqyMM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2fleafly-images%2fuser-profile%2fIlBrDpsRHSa636NHbiA6_mms.jpg.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":27,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":35},{"name":"Diesel","score":33},{"name":"Pungent","score":29},{"name":"Lemon","score":27},{"name":"Pine","score":16.5}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":62},{"name":"Happy","score":49.5},{"name":"Uplifted","score":45.5},{"name":"Energetic","score":37.5},{"name":"Focused","score":29}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":31},{"name":"Headaches","score":27},{"name":"Depression","score":22.5},{"name":"Stress","score":22.5},{"name":"Fatigue","score":18.5}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":16.5},{"name":"PTSD","score":16.5},{"name":"Anorexia","score":14.5},{"name":"Cancer","score":14.5},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":14.5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":18.5},{"name":"Dizzy","score":14.5},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":2}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":["Phoenix, AZ","Portland, OR","Bend, OR","Eugene, OR","Tucson, AZ","Cochise, AZ","Glendale, AZ","Mesa, AZ","Scottsdale, AZ","Sierra Vista, AZ"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/rocky-dennis","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.85185185185185/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Flo","subtitle":null,"slug":"flo","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/flo","symbol":"Flo","applink":"leafly://strain/flo"},{"name":"Sour Dubble","subtitle":null,"slug":"sour-dubble","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble","symbol":"Sdb","applink":"leafly://strain/sour-dubble"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
