The inhale produces an immediate smile and the exhale leaves you wanting another taste immediately.\n\nEffects: Joy, giggles, euphoria that last quite a while, followed by blissful relaxation. Great for depression, pain relief, and in higher doses, insomnia.\n\nI've only found this strain once, but hopefully more farms will grow it and it's reputation will spread far and wide.\n\n10/10",
