            "text": "This strain is a very high sativa. Looking at the nugs, they're bright green and very dense. The buds look like a typical sativa nug would look like. The smell is what catches your attention. The smell is a very nice sour lemon/citrus aroma with a pungent earthy dirt smell. It's almost a skunk-dirty smell that has a sour overtone with that lemon/citrus. The high is also why you'll want to look out for the strain. The effects are all behind the eyes and in/around your head. It's a social or focused high that makes you want to be doing something. The effects take a moment to kick in, but the high will last about 1.5-2.5 hours, which is awesome if for medicating. If you enjoy heavy sativa's but want to have something done in a day, this is a perfect strain.",
