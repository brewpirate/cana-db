Firstly, its extremely pungent, I could easily smell it right through the paper bag and ziplock bag it was delivered in.  It has a fruity, skunky, diesel-y stench that is pretty amazing.  The high is extremely relaxing for the body and mind, and is a good pick for enjoying at night time.  I would definitely buy this one again.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/tAHHcVjF5EvieYWgrsxPA0WBCr8=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fRAbBXkNBSHOIMMxhio7k_wide-brim-red.png"},{"id":1506773,"username":"Rx420ReBirth","text":"Oh toto, I think we\u0027re lost!
