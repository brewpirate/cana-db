Firstly, its extremely pungent, I could easily smell it right through the paper bag and ziplock bag it was delivered in.  It has a fruity, skunky, diesel-y stench that is pretty amazing.  The high is extremely relaxing for the body and mind, and is a good pick for enjoying at night time.  I would definitely buy this one again.",
