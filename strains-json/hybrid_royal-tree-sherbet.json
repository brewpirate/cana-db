Their products always taste very \"rich\" to me - full flavored. \n\nSherbet had a distinct woodsy taste kind of like a fine whiskey - if you have ever had the opportunity to sip some good stuff. There was a little citrus in the background as well. It drew well and was very smooth. No sharp or burnt taste at all and no coughing. \n\nIf you have the opportunity to try it, I would give it a shot. It's great for a relaxing evening around the house.",
