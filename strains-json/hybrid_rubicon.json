I would recommend picking this up as a medicinal for the CBD content (~9%) or as recreational for a happy, relaxed day with a light high.",

It has a very relaxing pleasant body high to it, nothing too heavy yet still very noticable. There is a slight head high, a pressure around the forehead and a slight sensation in the eyes. I can't speak on how well it works for pain because I actually use CBD strains for the great anti-anxiety/euphoric properties which arent as noticable in this strain when compared to other's I've used.",
