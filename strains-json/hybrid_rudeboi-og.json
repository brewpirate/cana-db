Rude Boi is a super energizing and engaging strain.  Its uplifting vibe put a smile on my face as I laced up my running shoes and took the dogs for a moonlit run.  Listening to the dance grooves of Daft Punk, Rude Boi had me floating. I\u0027d say this strain is the perfect accompaniment to staying moving while getting lifted.  Great for going for a run, doing housework or sitting down to write strain reviews, Rude Boi is a productive, active strain. Those looking to use cannabis medicinally my find this strain useful for treating depression.

While they might be new to our strain Explorer, many of them have been circulating the market for a while now. If you\u0027ve come across some of them before, write a strain review!\n \n   1. Honey Bananas\n\nHoney Bananas from Elemental Seeds is a heavy-handed hybrid strain bred from Strawberry Banana and Honey Boo Boo. This cannabis strain earns its name with a resinous coat as sticky as honey and an unmistakable banana aroma. She leans heavily toward the indica side of the family, providing weighty full-body effects coupled with an invigorating buzz of cerebral euphoria.\n\n \n   2. Papa\u0027s OG\n\nCultivated in Glendale, Arizona exclusively by Arizona Organix, Papa’s OG is an indica cannabis strain that provides positive and uplifting cerebral effects in unique combination with the classic indica full-body relaxation. Consumers find it to be functional and social while still remaining true to its indica roots. A descendant of Skywalker OG and OG Kush, Papa’s OG inherits a sweet and earthy grape aroma and potent medicinal effects suitable for patients treating pain, insomnia, and stress disorders.\n\n \n   3. Sin Valley OG\n\nSin Valley OG is a 60/40 indica-dominant cannabis strain bred by Sin City Seeds, who crossed SFV OG with a Blue Power indica. The resulting hybrid boasts high yields and well-structured buds with an earthy and sour lemon aroma. Beginning with a crushing blast of cerebral euphoria, Sin Valley OG brings an edge to your appetite while coercing muscles into serene relaxation.\n\n \n   4. LA Chocolat\n\nLA Chocolate, bred by DNA Genetics, is a 60/40 indica-dominant strain parented by their cherished LA Confidential indica and Chocolope sativa. This power-couple collectively passes on the best of their qualities: thick resin production, heavy yields, and a sweet, earthy aroma of chocolate and coffee. Its soothing physical effects sink through the body, keeping you relaxed while kindling the appetite.\n\n \n   5. UltraViolet OG\n\nFrom Archive Seeds, UltraViolet OG is an 80% indica strain bred by crossing Face Off OG with Purple Indica from the Pacific Northwest. With this genetic combination, the breeders hoped to improve the yield and flowering time while still maintaining a deep purple coloration, and UltraViolet OG achieved just that. This powerful indica strain delivers dreamy, sleepy euphoria that grants your eyelids some heaviness at night while giving your mood a burst of positivity.\n \n\n   6. Jimi Hendrix\n\nThere are many genetic combinations that fall under the name Jimi Hendrix, but this southern Oregon hybrid descends from Jack Herer, Headband, and Black Cherry Soda. Led by its sativa genetics, Jimi Hendrix delivers a cerebrally focused jolt of euphoric energy that helps feed creativity and focus in low doses. In a show of its diverse terpene profile, Jimi Hendrix has a complex aroma that spans flavors from earthy pine to sweet lemon and citrus. \n\n \n   7. RudeBoi OG\n\nBred by Archive Seeds, RudeBoi OG is an indica-dominant hybrid cannabis strain that brings together genetics from two OG Kush phenotypes, Irene OG and a backcrossed Face Off OG. The hashy kush aroma typically found in OG varieties comes out strong in this hybrid, providing a flavorful introduction with a refreshing finish. RudeBoi OG produces potently sublime, relaxing effects that envelopes both mind and body.\n\n \nCheck out our other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or catch up on last week\u0027s recently added strains!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12002157/new-strains-alert-honey-bananas-sin-valley-og-jimi-hendrix-la-cho.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-honey-bananas-sin-valley-og-jimi-hendrix-la-cho"}],"reviewCount":55,"flavors":[{"name":"Pine","score":35.119047619047613},{"name":"Skunk","score":34.523809523809518},{"name":"Earthy","score":32.142857142857139},{"name":"Woody","score":14.285714285714285},{"name":"Pungent","score":13.69047619047619}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":105.35714285714286},{"name":"Happy","score":85.714285714285722},{"name":"Euphoric","score":69.047619047619051},{"name":"Uplifted","score":60.11904761904762},{"name":"Hungry","score":54.166666666666664}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":48.214285714285708},{"name":"Depression","score":34.523809523809518},{"name":"Pain","score":30.952380952380949},{"name":"Insomnia","score":25.595238095238095},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":23.809523809523807}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":35.714285714285708},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":19.047619047619044},{"name":"Arthritis","score":10.119047619047617},{"name":"PTSD","score":7.7380952380952372},{"name":"PMS","score":3.5714285714285712}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":45.833333333333336},{"name":"Dizzy","score":16.071428571428569},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.3809523809523809}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/rudeboi-og_100x100_fe92.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/536747/b/rudeboi-og__primary_ee01.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/rudeboi-og_100x100_fd08.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/427403/b/rudeboi-og__primary_0c48.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/rudeboi-og_100x100_0d15.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/392502/b/rudeboi-og__primary_69a9.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":3,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Eugene, OR","Seattle, WA","Springfield, OR","Bellevue, WA","Salem, OR","Beaverton, OR","Bend, OR","Everett, WA","Hood River, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/rudeboi-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.72727272727273/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Face Off OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"face-off-og","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/face-off-og","symbol":"Fac","applink":"leafly://strain/face-off-og"},{"name":"Irene OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"irene-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/irene-kush","symbol":"Ire","applink":"leafly://strain/irene-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":67,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
