Extremely aromatic (along the likes of Jack Herer or Grape Ape in terms of pungency) with dense, conical buds that are generously frosted. Bright orange hairs add visual texture throughout as well. The taste of the smoke upon exhale is enough to make the most experienced patients lean back with eyebrows raised, impressed frown and head nods all around. Tastes exactly as it smells- a true rarity. Smoking this flower leaves the user wonderfully relaxed and in a mellow mood, yet still allowing for creativity in the mind and the opportunity for an involved harmony with one\u0027s surroundings. Newer patients should caution the sedating effects of this strain despite its hybrid nature, and veteran smokers can enjoy that a little goes a long way for uplifting any situation.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/TM-mPnW4zCMJIV6HG92VAiM-w30=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2fleafly-images%2fuser-profile%2feJ9GgRVhQ7KANNzF29tq_Balboa+Friend_Fotor.jpg.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3397","title":"New Strains Alert: Sour Amnesia, Dawg\u0027s Waltz, Petrolia Headstash, Tangilope, and Rug Burn OG","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1415995200000)\/","text":"It\u0027s Friday at last, so why not try some new strains this weekend?
