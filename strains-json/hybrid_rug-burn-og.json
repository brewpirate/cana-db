            "text": "Very sweet smelling and very sage like, compact buds and of course super dank hairs all over this bud it has a little of a curved structure hits my eyes and jaw immediately. Heavy tastes of lime! Not lemon lime for sure very tasty the sage is in here too, Its a nice uplifting strain that brings you back to a wonderful memory of being medicated and carefree, love the light body on this hybrid, I think what I  am find is that the ghost OG in this strain is strong! I got this for free since my order was messed up. This rare dankness strain is unusual too never heard of the dankness strain, rare darkness yes of course super sleep combo of grape ape and og kush. The effects for this are heavy uplifting concentration while taming your pain its great if your looking for something with  more psychedelic \"lucy in the sky with diamonds\" or a \"D-D-D-D-D-DDDDDDROP THE BASS WAHWHA\" ya feel me for you lovers of one word its great.\nRecommend this for those looking for a nice vacation wwhen you simply can't afford it. ADHD, Migrains,Pain,PMS, depression and of course, Nausea! Happy trails~",

            "text": "One of the best strains I've had from Harvest of Scottsdale, stands head and shoulder above the rest and slams the senses in delight. Extremely aromatic (along the likes of Jack Herer or Grape Ape in terms of pungency) with dense, conical buds that are generously frosted. Bright orange hairs add visual texture throughout as well. The taste of the smoke upon exhale is enough to make the most experienced patients lean back with eyebrows raised, impressed frown and head nods all around. Tastes exactly as it smells- a true rarity. Smoking this flower leaves the user wonderfully relaxed and in a mellow mood, yet still allowing for creativity in the mind and the opportunity for an involved harmony with one's surroundings. Newer patients should caution the sedating effects of this strain despite its hybrid nature, and veteran smokers can enjoy that a little goes a long way for uplifting any situation.",
