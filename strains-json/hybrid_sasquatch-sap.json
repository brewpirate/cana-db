I\u0027m not sure why such a chemical-drenched flavor is enticing, but it is, and it\u0027s certainly unique among the usual piney Kush and sour fruit varieties populating shelves.\n\nEffects were immediate and strong out of a vaporizer... Sasquatch Sap begins with a buzzy, sativa head high (smiles, pressure around the forehead and cheekbones) but then settles into a kind of meditative, relaxed body buzz. I wouldn\u0027t say I was glued to the couch-- I think the \"Glue\" part of this strain refers to how sticky* it is-- but I did feel fantastically mellow, and the latter half of the high was perfect for watching movies and de-stressing.\n\nTo sum up, this is a great strain for stress, anxiety or just unwinding after a long day. But it\u0027s not a lazy strain, either, and I\u0027m looking forward to trying it with a workout-- the energy boost on the front end and the relaxation afterward seem like they\u0027d be the perfect pairing. Highly recommend!\n\n*Oh yeah, it\u0027s REALLY sticky. Like it was physically difficult to grind, even though my batch was perfectly cured. Intense.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"},{"id":1589907,"username":"MaxxWood","text":"Wouldn’t it be great if we associated specific strains with specific seasons? Like how we associate pumpkin spice with autumn. \n\nUntil then, partake in this sizzlin sativa: It is a perfect springtime strain that will put a SPRING in your step. Ideal for a post-workout shower ‘n bake (and don’t be surprised if you find yourself cleaning out the shower before the body high sets in) \n\nOne note though: The body high is sufficiently high enough (hee) that I don’t recommend working out while high off of this strain.
