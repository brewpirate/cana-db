    "description": "<p>3C Sasquatch Sap is a unique and heady sativa, dishing out a strong meditative mental state from the onset that slinks down into the body. The aroma and flavor of this flower&rsquo;s tightly bound colas are distinctive, leading with a heavy dose of diesel and finishing with tartness on the palate. This strain is a hybrid blend of <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister\">Chem&rsquo;s Sister</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel\">Chocolate Diesel</a>, doling out semi-stimulating qualities that fill the body with warmth while setting the mind free. Enjoy this strain before physical activity for a complementary body high, or after physical activity to reinvigorate the mind and im-bue the body with an airy lightness. &nbsp;</p>\n",

            "text": "Purchased in flower form from downtown LA's Cannabal City Collective (a spot I highly recommend), this is 3C Farms' take on Gorilla Glue #4, and the frosted, fluffy nugs definitely express major diesel fumes and flavor on the palate. I'm not sure why such a chemical-drenched flavor is enticing, but it is, and it's certainly unique among the usual piney Kush and sour fruit varieties populating shelves.\n\nEffects were immediate and strong out of a vaporizer... Sasquatch Sap begins with a buzzy, sativa head high (smiles, pressure around the forehead and cheekbones) but then settles into a kind of meditative, relaxed body buzz. I wouldn't say I was glued to the couch-- I think the \"Glue\" part of this strain refers to how sticky* it is-- but I did feel fantastically mellow, and the latter half of the high was perfect for watching movies and de-stressing.\n\nTo sum up, this is a great strain for stress, anxiety or just unwinding after a long day. But it's not a lazy strain, either, and I'm looking forward to trying it with a workout-- the energy boost on the front end and the relaxation afterward seem like they'd be the perfect pairing. Highly recommend!\n\n*Oh yeah, it's REALLY sticky. Like it was physically difficult to grind, even though my batch was perfectly cured. Intense.",

            "text": "Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we associated specific strains with specific seasons? Like how we associate pumpkin spice with autumn. \n\nUntil then, partake in this sizzlin sativa: It is a perfect springtime strain that will put a SPRING in your step. Ideal for a post-workout shower \u2018n bake (and don\u2019t be surprised if you find yourself cleaning out the shower before the body high sets in) \n\nOne note though: The body high is sufficiently high enough (hee) that I don\u2019t recommend working out while high off of this strain. You might ignore a pain signal and get hurt ",
