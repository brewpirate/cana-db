So a few days ago, I picked up an 8th at my favorite shop to give it another go.  After one bowl, my anxiety was through the roof, and I got into an argument with my loved ones.  The issue of the argument wasn\u0027t  my fault, but my anxious state didn\u0027t help matters.  I gave it another try on another day and was able to enjoy it without anxiety.  Secret Recipe is a nice happy hybrid, but I consider my set and setting carefully with this one.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1578959,"username":"bubblyyyyyyyy","text":"super nice strain, leaves me feeling happy and comfortable with a little body buzz. i normally clench my teeth because of stress but this strain helped me relax enough not to","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/ZtQxS6XT_MjOwMadRkRsU9ZNU-I=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fX2q7eTOS7WxMAnwrLSBM_wide-brim-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":51,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":50.969696969696962},{"name":"Pine","score":49.469696969696962},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":14.136363636363635},{"name":"Sweet","score":14.090909090909092},{"name":"Diesel","score":12.590909090909092}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":110.03030303030303},{"name":"Euphoric","score":96.893939393939377},{"name":"Hungry","score":74.7121212121212},{"name":"Happy","score":65.060606060606062},{"name":"Uplifted","score":61.060606060606055}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":83.8030303030303},{"name":"Inflammation","score":71.7121212121212},{"name":"Depression","score":55.015151515151516},{"name":"Pain","score":53.515151515151516},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":47.469696969696962}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":17.136363636363637},{"name":"PTSD","score":10.590909090909092},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":10.590909090909092},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":9.5909090909090917},{"name":"Multiple Sclerosis","score":9.0909090909090917}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":67.166666666666657},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":15.636363636363635},{"name":"Anxious","score":3},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.5}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/secret-recipe_100x100_4360.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/350513/b/secret-recipe__primary_43ef.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Spokane, WA","Everett, WA","Bellingham, WA","Bothell, WA","Renton, WA","Vancouver, WA","Bellevue, WA","Bremerton, WA","Edmonds, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/secret-recipe","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.33333333333333/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Chemdawg","subtitle":null,"slug":"chemdawg","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/chemdawg","symbol":"Cd","applink":"leafly://strain/chemdawg"},{"name":"Abusive OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"abusive-og","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/abusive-og","symbol":"Abu","applink":"leafly://strain/abusive-og"},{"name":"Sour Diesel","subtitle":null,"slug":"sour-diesel","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/sour-diesel","symbol":"Sd","applink":"leafly://strain/sour-diesel"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
