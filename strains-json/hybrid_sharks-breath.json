    "description": "<p>Sharksbreath is another strain with a funny name that can provide some serious relief. This indica-dominant hybrid comes from DNA Genetics and is a cross of Great White Shark and <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/sativa/lamb-s-bread\">Lamb&rsquo;s Bread</a>. Its subtle aroma doesn&rsquo;t smell of the ocean, but more like sweet and sour candy. Though it leans more indica, this flower tends to leave consumers feeling alert and ready to tackle the rest of their day without any hints of depression or anxiety. Sharksbreath plants flower by 9 weeks and will stay short. Its heavy colas make this strain a great choice for Sea of Green-style growing, where it produces very high yields.</p>\n",

Tryin to get faded, son.\" And then babygirl was like,\"Don't call me son.\" Then upon toke on this fantastic strain, I experienced a moderate \"classic high\" with a lot of deep relaxation similar to a really expensive ass shiatsu massage afterglow. Got a little thirsty but didn't want to move. Asked bae to bring up some water and got my hydrate on. Apologized to babygirl for calling her \"son.\" I did get a bit of a strange aftertaste from this strain, but that ain't nothing some ribs can't fix. Amirite?",
