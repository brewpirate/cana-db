            "text": "The overall story behind this is wonderfully overdone.  The drama intense (isn't most weed bred in secret?), the local color beautiful (I can see the peasant farmers, growing weed on a mountain side in Japan), and the promised therapeutic effect somewhat ambiguously specific (direct relief at  shiatsu points).\n\nThe high, fortunately, lives up to the hype.  It is effective for pain, for me.  It is an indica high, with the typical couch lock, but it is the kind of couch lock that gives the whole concept a good name.  Rather than regretting my time sitting, I tend to enjoy watching television, reading a book, or browsing leafly.\n\nThe sample I am enjoying is from NuGreen in Spokane, WA.  I purchased it from Sativa Sisters, a 502 retailer.",
