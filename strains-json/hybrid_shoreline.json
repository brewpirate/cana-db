Shoreline is a strain of legend. Supposedly first appearing in the early 1980s, it is known as a true &ldquo;old school skunk.&rdquo; Fittingly, its name is rumored to come from the state&rsquo;s Shoreline amphitheater after the strain made a successful debut there during a Grateful Dead concert. Its super strong skunky smell may border on unappetizing, but its large, hairy buds make up for it with equally potent effects. Sativa-dominant, this strain will free your mind and may verge into the psychedelic for some. A clone-only plant, true connoisseurs wonder if the original can still be found. In an effort to continue its lineage, Shoreline has been crossed with many other strains. If it&rsquo;s found outside of its Texas homeland, a mix is probably what you&rsquo;re getting.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

I will post a photo of some true htown shore. I have grown this strain for years and it is one of my favorite daytime medicines. It is so intensely heady that you will catch yourself having just spent the last half hr in an absolute over-analyzitional thought of whatever pops into your mind. It is a vintage road skunk strain and is a strong sativa dom hybrid. This is a full 12 week strain boys n girls. The flowers have HUGE round calyxes at full maturity and are absolutely DRIPPING w glandulars. It wreaks to the moon of skunk and almost fecle scent no joke. Shoreline was bred in corpus christi almost 30 yrs ago and is THE staple strain of Houston, Tx.",
