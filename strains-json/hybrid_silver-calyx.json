            "text": "When my friend brought out the bag with the Silver Calyx, I swear I could see sparkles shinning reflecting out of the bag. Really beautiful light green buds with large peaking calyxes covered in thick coating of silver crystals. The name is well deserved. It has a bright and sharp citrus aroma that tingles the nostril. \n      I've smoked both through a water pipe and a joint and much prefer the joint cause the light lemon cookie flavor is really able to come though. I was also amazed how far a nugg could go. I was able to roll a nice doobie with a pretty small nugg.\n     I took a hike through the redwoods after smoking, and all the ferns and fauna of the forest were bright and vibrant and I felt comfortable and energized. My vision got foggy and watery but that also could have been the coastal air. \nAll in all, I really like this strain. Only bummer is, I'm down to my last gram.",
