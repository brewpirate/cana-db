The resulting sativa dominant hybrid is potent and has strong mental effects that can verge on psychedelic, making it too strong for some users or those who want to slow things down mentally. Silver Pearl plants are best grown indoors and flower at 7 weeks or even sooner, making them overachievers for sativas. The short plants will have buds with few leaves, bright orange hairs, and a heavy trichome coloring that make these flowers sticky with resin pearls. Silver Pearl smells like dark chocolate and has a sweet honey taste. It was the winner of the 1994 <em>High Times</em> Cannabis Cup in the Hybrids category.</p>",

            "text": "Silver Pearl is a beautiful flower, a sativa dominant hybrid with just enough of an indica kick to sit you down.  My batch came in small to medium sized nugz that literally stuck to the LID of the jar.  Bustling with a microscopic milky way of trich coverage and sprouting more red hairs at odd angles than a ginger on his 14th birthday, the Silver Pearl lives up to its name with its opaque appearance and rarity on most menus.  It smokes just as great as it looks, with a slightly skunky taste and smell, and just a snapper at a time to keep from choking to death.  It hits hard and immediate, leaving you swearing that you just ripped a heavy indica at first, until you realize that you just spent the past hour with a slack jaw trying to figure out how to harness the power of the \"sphere\" for the good of mankind.  Do not pass up Silver Pearl if it crosses your path.",
