My batch came in small to medium sized nugz that literally stuck to the LID of the jar.  Bustling with a microscopic milky way of trich coverage and sprouting more red hairs at odd angles than a ginger on his 14th birthday, the Silver Pearl lives up to its name with its opaque appearance and rarity on most menus.  It smokes just as great as it looks, with a slightly skunky taste and smell, and just a snapper at a time to keep from choking to death.  It hits hard and immediate, leaving you swearing that you just ripped a heavy indica at first, until you realize that you just spent the past hour with a slack jaw trying to figure out how to harness the power of the \"sphere\" for the good of mankind.  Do not pass up Silver Pearl if it crosses your path.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sPaGuIbcIjKwcF8O7kQXXoAFJ6s=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fkfmswExdS0yqeEmdLkUQ_nerd-green.png"},{"id":1571533,"username":"chester187","text":"nice strain for when you need that little boost but also want to have a somewhat body stone.\nit\u0027s a match made in heaven","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/ZtQxS6XT_MjOwMadRkRsU9ZNU-I=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fX2q7eTOS7WxMAnwrLSBM_wide-brim-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":67,"flavors":[{"name":"Skunk","score":13.313253012048193},{"name":"Citrus","score":6.9477911646586339},{"name":"Sweet","score":6.646586345381527},{"name":"Pine","score":4.5381526104417675},{"name":"Diesel","score":4.2369477911646589}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":28.112449799196785},{"name":"Happy","score":25.1004016064257},{"name":"Uplifted","score":24.799196787148592},{"name":"Relaxed","score":24.518072289156628},{"name":"Creative","score":20.261044176706829}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":18.132530120481928},{"name":"Fatigue","score":12.409638554216867},{"name":"Pain","score":11.787148594377509},{"name":"Depression","score":11.184738955823294},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":4.8393574297188753}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":5.72289156626506},{"name":"PMS","score":5.1405622489959839},{"name":"Multiple Sclerosis","score":4.2369477911646589},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":3.3132530120481931},{"name":"PTSD","score":2.7108433734939759}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":23.895582329317264},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":20.883534136546182},{"name":"Anxious","score":9.0763052208835351},{"name":"Dizzy","score":5.1405622489959839},{"name":"Headache","score":4.2369477911646589}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/silver-pearl_100x100_ae61.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/565134/b/silver-pearl__primary_00d5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/silver-pearl_100x100_558f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/524225/b/silver-pearl__primary_b016.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/silver-pearl_100x100_6df5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/511926/b/silver-pearl__primary_0be5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/silver-pearl_100x100_772b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/508843/b/silver-pearl__primary_f280.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/silver-pearl_100x100_811b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/506581/b/silver-pearl__primary_03e5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/silver-pearl_100x100_57c8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/503633/b/silver-pearl__primary_625c.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":31,"popularCities":["Colorado Springs, CO","Edmonton, AB","Montr√©al, QC","Vancouver, BC","Denver, CO","Ypsilanti, MI"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.37313432835821/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
