    "description": "<p>Silver Surfer is a sativa-dominant hybrid whose potent cerebral effects may have you feeling like you&rsquo;re zipping through the space with your super-hero powers. This strain is very energetic and motivates many to check things off their lists or inspires talkative social activities. The indica effects are subtle and help to end this high on a relaxing note. This strain is true medical quality, so it may be a bit too active for new patients or those who experience anxiety. Silver Surfer is a cross of <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/sativa/super-silver-haze\">Super Silver Haze</a> and <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-dream\">Blue Dream</a>. Plants flower in 8 to 9 weeks with large, crystal-covered yields.</p>\n",

Normally, I'm too paranoid to drive within about 4 or 5 hours of smoking, but when it's Silver Surfer, I could drive a fucking plane under a bridge without breaking a sweat. If you get the chance, smoke a fat bowl of this shit and you'll see where I'm coming from. By far the most purely positive pot experience I've had. This is my first and (probably) only review on Leafly. I made an account just to give this strain five stars. That's how good it is.",
