See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog the Aging Ent\u0027s Tastings --\nBrand: Liberty Reach\nStrain: Sin Valley OG Kush\nBalanced Hybrid--Potency Analysis: TTL 24.2% THC 23.8% CBD 0.4%\n--Cost: $15/gram--\nIt\u0027s not often that a basically perfectly balanced marijuana falls into your hands.  Yeah, that\u0027s how I\u0027m starting this review out.\n\nI\u0027ve smoked lots of Liberty Reach and Jackpot Seaweed marijuana - both produced by BMF Washington.  They have quite a few strains and they\u0027re always quality grows.  This particular strain reminds me very much - in balance and high - of their Bettie Page which was also a perfectly balanced strain.\n--\nThe stink on this is spectacularly skunky.  There\u0027s a great lemony-zing of citrus under it, and rich floral notes as well.  Breaking it up was just euphoric, the smells were almost palpable.\n--\nI really liked the flavor of this.  It\u0027s that great-pot taste.  Just very herbal, marijuana, sweet, a little exotic floral to it.  It was not intense - just the right level of mellow.  The smoke is super smooth.  I mean, smooooth on this.  \n--\nThe high is great - exactly what I expected out of this 50/50 hybrid, with just a touch of more indica-like body effects than there are head effects.  This is outstandingly well balanced - the high smoothly lifts you up smoothly and keeps you feeling good for a while.  This is what I\u0027d consider as a benchmark for a True Hybrid experience.\n--\nAfter smoking this, I was relaxed and feeling good for a long while.  The legs on this are just fantastic and the come-down was as gentle as the ride up was.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/YEN1LqXiYCOvWiFhmP-4p67iqDM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fY9fB9qHySLml8016ysgJ_goggles-green.png"},{"id":1490671,"username":"carterkush092","text":"Beautiful looking strain, the buds are a nice light green with  tons of crystals throughout.

While they might be new to our strain Explorer, many of them have been circulating the market for a while now. If you\u0027ve come across some of them before, write a strain review!\n \n   1. Honey Bananas\n\nHoney Bananas from Elemental Seeds is a heavy-handed hybrid strain bred from Strawberry Banana and Honey Boo Boo. This cannabis strain earns its name with a resinous coat as sticky as honey and an unmistakable banana aroma. She leans heavily toward the indica side of the family, providing weighty full-body effects coupled with an invigorating buzz of cerebral euphoria.\n\n \n   2. Papa\u0027s OG\n\nCultivated in Glendale, Arizona exclusively by Arizona Organix, Papa’s OG is an indica cannabis strain that provides positive and uplifting cerebral effects in unique combination with the classic indica full-body relaxation. Consumers find it to be functional and social while still remaining true to its indica roots. A descendant of Skywalker OG and OG Kush, Papa’s OG inherits a sweet and earthy grape aroma and potent medicinal effects suitable for patients treating pain, insomnia, and stress disorders.\n\n \n   3. Sin Valley OG\n\nSin Valley OG is a 60/40 indica-dominant cannabis strain bred by Sin City Seeds, who crossed SFV OG with a Blue Power indica. The resulting hybrid boasts high yields and well-structured buds with an earthy and sour lemon aroma. Beginning with a crushing blast of cerebral euphoria, Sin Valley OG brings an edge to your appetite while coercing muscles into serene relaxation.\n\n \n   4. LA Chocolat\n\nLA Chocolate, bred by DNA Genetics, is a 60/40 indica-dominant strain parented by their cherished LA Confidential indica and Chocolope sativa. This power-couple collectively passes on the best of their qualities: thick resin production, heavy yields, and a sweet, earthy aroma of chocolate and coffee. Its soothing physical effects sink through the body, keeping you relaxed while kindling the appetite.\n\n \n   5. UltraViolet OG\n\nFrom Archive Seeds, UltraViolet OG is an 80% indica strain bred by crossing Face Off OG with Purple Indica from the Pacific Northwest. With this genetic combination, the breeders hoped to improve the yield and flowering time while still maintaining a deep purple coloration, and UltraViolet OG achieved just that. This powerful indica strain delivers dreamy, sleepy euphoria that grants your eyelids some heaviness at night while giving your mood a burst of positivity.\n \n\n   6. Jimi Hendrix\n\nThere are many genetic combinations that fall under the name Jimi Hendrix, but this southern Oregon hybrid descends from Jack Herer, Headband, and Black Cherry Soda. Led by its sativa genetics, Jimi Hendrix delivers a cerebrally focused jolt of euphoric energy that helps feed creativity and focus in low doses. In a show of its diverse terpene profile, Jimi Hendrix has a complex aroma that spans flavors from earthy pine to sweet lemon and citrus. \n\n \n   7. RudeBoi OG\n\nBred by Archive Seeds, RudeBoi OG is an indica-dominant hybrid cannabis strain that brings together genetics from two OG Kush phenotypes, Irene OG and a backcrossed Face Off OG. The hashy kush aroma typically found in OG varieties comes out strong in this hybrid, providing a flavorful introduction with a refreshing finish. RudeBoi OG produces potently sublime, relaxing effects that envelopes both mind and body.\n\n \nCheck out our other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or catch up on last week\u0027s recently added strains!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12002157/new-strains-alert-honey-bananas-sin-valley-og-jimi-hendrix-la-cho.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-honey-bananas-sin-valley-og-jimi-hendrix-la-cho"}],"reviewCount":39,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":7.2222222222222214},{"name":"Citrus","score":5},{"name":"Lemon","score":3.3333333333333335},{"name":"Pungent","score":3.3333333333333335},{"name":"Pine","score":2.7777777777777777}],"effects":[{"name":"Sleepy","score":43.055555555555557},{"name":"Relaxed","score":38.333333333333336},{"name":"Hungry","score":32.777777777777779},{"name":"Happy","score":23.611111111111111},{"name":"Uplifted","score":17.5}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":20.277777777777779},{"name":"Depression","score":17.5},{"name":"Insomnia","score":17.5},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":16.944444444444443},{"name":"Pain","score":16.944444444444443}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":18.055555555555557},{"name":"Arthritis","score":12.5},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":12.5},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":12.5},{"name":"Migraines","score":2.2222222222222223}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":15.833333333333334},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":14.722222222222221},{"name":"Dizzy","score":13.055555555555555},{"name":"Paranoid","score":0.55555555555555558},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.55555555555555558}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sin-valley-og_100x100_c539.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1003419/b/sin-valley-og__primary_9f4f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sin-valley-og_100x100_13dd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000481/b/sin-valley-og__primary_4470.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sin-valley-og_100x100_a704.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/506086/b/sin-valley-og__primary_de7c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sin-valley-og_100x100_be8e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/500210/b/sin-valley-og__primary_8776.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sin-valley-og_100x100_f70d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/462058/b/sin-valley-og__primary_cb2a.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":5,"popularCities":["Las Vegas, NV","Denver, CO","Phoenix, AZ","Apache Junction, AZ","Carson City, NV","Granite Falls, WA","Kelso, WA","Mountlake Terrace, WA","Reno, NV","Spokane, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.46153846153846/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"SFV OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"sfv-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-og","symbol":"Sfv","applink":"leafly://strain/sfv-og"},{"name":"Blue Power","subtitle":null,"slug":"blue-power","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/blue-power","symbol":"Bpw","applink":"leafly://strain/blue-power"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":65,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tYields 350 to 500 grams per square meter\n\n"}}
