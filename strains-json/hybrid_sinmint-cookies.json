            "text": "Whether you\u2019re planning to spend your summer weekends at festivals, weddings, or a combination of the two, there\u2019s one accessory you need above all else\u2014flower crowns, of course! These beautiful floral haloes embrace and enhance\u00a0natural beauty,\u00a0making them a perfect addition to any bridal party or music event.\nA crown of your favorite blossoms is lovely, but a crown that also showcases your favorite\u00a0strain\u00a0is even better. Coachella agrees\u2014the fashion-forward music festival was dotted with this\u00a0hot new headwear trend sparked in large part by California-based Lowell Herb Co., which ran a special offer on canna-crowns in advance of the fest.\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\nBelow, we show you how to make\u00a0an herb-accented\u00a0version of the classic flower crown. The best part? Your cannabis will be right at your fingertips wherever you go\u2014simply pop off a bud without losing the aesthetic of the accessory.\nHave you ever worked\u00a0cannabis buds into\u00a0your bouquets or flower crown creations? Tell us about it or drop your pictures in the comments below!\nDIY: How to Make a Cannabis Flower Crown\nYou\u2019ll need:\n\nFloral wire\nFloral tape\nWire cutters\nFresh flowers\n2-4 grams\u00a0cannabis of your choosing\u00a0(we picked up some SinMint Cookies\u00a0and Elphinstone from Oz. Recreational Cannabis)\n\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\nTip: We stopped by the iconic Pike Place Market in Seattle to pick up two fresh bouquets, then headed to our local florist to nab the rest of our items (save the cannabis). We recommend visiting\u00a0your local farmer\u2019s market for some seasonal blooms.\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\nDirections\n\nMeasure the floral wire around your head so that it will be big enough to fit, with 1\u20132\u00a0spare inches on either end for wrapping. Cut wire.\n\n\n\nForm your wire into a halo,\u00a0wrapping\u00a0the two ends together with floral tape.\n\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\n\nContinue wrapping the tape around the entire crown (this adds a more natural feel and makes it easier to tape your flowers). Set aside.\n\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\n\nCut the flower stems long enough to tape, but short enough to arrange on the crown\u00a0(we recommend stems range from 1-2 inches in length).\n\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\n\nBegin taping the stems to the crown whichever way your heart desires.\n\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\n\nContinue adding flowers and buds until you\u2019re\u00a0satisfied with your creation (and don\u2019t forget to snap an Instagram pic).\n\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\nTip: Cannabis buds are a bit difficult to tape down due to their short stems. We recommend shaving off the bottom leaves of a cannabis bud in order to free up space on the stem. This will make the cannabis easier to work into your flower crown.\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\nNow that your crown is finished, you\u2019re ready for the big event, whether that be your own wedding or a chill night with friends in the backyard. Have fun!",

A 50/50 hybrid, Cherry OG truly brings you the best of both sativa and indica worlds as it delivers full-body euphoria alongside high-flying cerebral lucidity.

WSU\n\nWSU is a Washington-grown rendition of the indica strain Chemo and it\u2019s waiting for you on the shelves of recreational stores state-wide. Named in homage to Washington State University, don\u2019t confuse this strain with the UW indica, whose name is derived from the rivaling University of Washington. Its effects are described as relaxed and spacey. Citrus and berry flavors invade the palate on the inhale, providing a flavorful introduction to WSU\u2019s heavy indica effects.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying WSU\n\u00a0\n 3.

SinMint Cookies\n\nSinMint Cookies is Sin City Seeds\u2019 signature hybrid cross between GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) and Blue Power.

Training Day\n\nBred by DNA Genetics, Training Day is a 70% indica that combines parent strains Trainwreck and LA Confidential. This California native takes after its LA Confidential parent in aroma and delivers a pungent earthy and pine flavor. As demonstrated by its thick blanket of crystal resin, Training Day will put your THC tolerance to the test so novices should approach this strain with caution.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Training Day\n\u00a0\n 7. OG Chem\n\nOG Chem, also called Chem OG, is a sativa-dominant cross between two legendary strains, Chemdawg and OG Kush.

If you need to be knocked out be pre-paired to be couch locked. Ultra top shelf nugs, these dank nuggeteers pack a powerful punch since blue power is crossed with this strain its incredibly heavy. Dry eyes more than mouth, but mega chill and social. Absolutely great wood and pungent earth taste sleepy effects are portrayed as well in this strain thanks to the heavy master kush. I would recommend this to those who have adhd, mood disorders, pms, ptsd, and nerve pain its a great coping strain!",
