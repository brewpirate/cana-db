            "text": "I got this strain from a Collective on the Central Coast CA.  The main reason I got this was it\u2019s amazing bag appeal.  The buds tend to be small but they look like they are covered in SNOW.  This strain is a total grinder killer, the high starts in your head and behind the eyes.  You\u2019ll most likely feel the effects after the first smoke.  Not too heavy, I\u2019d guess it to be 75:25 Indica dominant, so you will have some mental stimulation from the sativa side.  I believe this strain was a hybrid crossed with an indica and you will definitely feel the hybrid effects but after an hour or two, all you want to do is find a couch and a good movie.  I would give this strain 5 stars if the buds were larger.  That was my only negative about Sizzurp, was the size of the buds, the effects are 5 stars.",

THC tested at 24.87% CBD - 0%\n\nThe name definitely comes from the way it makes you feel - double cup of lean. However, this sizzurp is better in my experience as the Siz was predominately a head high, felt plenty of energy throughout my time.",
