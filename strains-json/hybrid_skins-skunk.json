Is. Delightful. Its pretty strong too, highly recommend for pain, anxiety and insomnia. After a small dab my whole body is pretty relaxed, eyes heavy. It\u0027s definitely working on my overall chronic pain as well as the muscle cramps and spasms I have from overdoing it yesterday and not sleeping last night. My pain level was at an 8 prior, now it\u0027s down to about a 4-5, which is sinifcant for me. I\u0027m feeling very content, in a pleasant resting mood about to put on some Netflix and just relax üòú Taste is good too, kinda sweet -\na little like strawberry lemonade. I feel ready for a nap now, thank the lord! This is certainly going to help me sleep tonight.

Hood Magic, Kid N\u0027 Cookies, Logic Diesel, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1460746260000)\/","text":"It\u0027s time to start stocking up for 4/20! Did you know you can search strains on Leafly by effects, flavors, benefits, and more? Use the advanced search filters at the top of our strain Explorer to \"customize\" your 4/20 experience! Or, allow us to recommend the following seven strains that were just added to our database. Who knows, maybe they\u0027re just what you\u0027re looking for.\n¬†\n¬†¬†1. Kid N\u0027 Cookies\n\nA cross of GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) (Forum cut) and Snowman OG, Kid n‚Äô Cookies is a collaboration between Fresno, CA breeders Loud Seeds, and Christopher ‚ÄúKid‚Äù Reid, better known as one half of the famous ‚Äò90s rap duo ‚ÄúKid n‚Äô Play.‚Äù As a potent indica-dominant hybrid testing at over 22% THC, Kid n‚Äô Cookies has a heavy, sedating high that can provide relief from pain, nausea, migraines, and insomnia. The flavor is much like the ‚Äúcookie‚Äù taste of GSC with undertones of pine.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†2. Tigermelon\n\nTigermelon is a mysterious strain of unknown origin that has been used by the breeder Bodhi Seeds to create some spectacular hybrids such as Snow Leopard. It is thought to be a three-way cross of Chemdawg, Apollo 11 (Genius cut) and an Uzbekistani indica, and the smell has been described by Bodhi as ‚Äúsandalwood mango lassi.‚Äù\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†3. Logic Diesel\n\nCreated by GroundSwell Cannabis Boutique in Denver, CO at the request of world-renowned electronic/acid jazz musician DJ Logic, Logic Diesel is a cross between Mystic Kush and NYC Diesel. It has a sweet and sour, skunky diesel odor and flavors ranging from sweet sandalwood to spicy fuel. Logic Diesel will provide an intense, exciting sense of euphoria along with a mildly relaxing body high that is perfect for hitting the dance floor.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†4. Haze Berry\n\nA cross between Super Silver Haze and DJ Short‚Äôs famous Blueberry, Haze Berry is an 80% sativa hybrid that has become quite popular for its combination of sweet berry, indica-like flavors, and sativa highs. As you might expect from a plant with two extremely potent parents, Haze Berry routinely tests at well over 20% THC, and some cultivars have a significant amount of CBD as well. In addition, it provides higher than average yields and a relatively short flowering time of 9-10 weeks, making this a very attractive strain for sativa enthusiasts. Haze Berry gives the consumer a euphoric, creativity-inducing high that gradually gives way to a profound sensation of relaxation and well-being.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†5. Mt. Hood Magic\n\nThought to be exclusive to Portland, Oregon dispensary Five Zero Trees, Mt. Hood Magic is a cross between Northern Lights #5 and Durban Poison. There a few different phenotypes available: two are indica-dominant and more resemble the NL5 portion of its genetics, testing at 17% and 14% THC; and one is sativa-dominant and similar to Durban Poison, testing at 19% THC.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†6. Citrus Sap\n\nFrom Crockett Family Farms and DNA Genetics, Citrus Sap is a hybrid cross between GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4) and Tangie. Growers can expect high yields, heavy resin production, and a sweet mandarin orange aroma, as well as a high calyx-to-leaf ratio. Its flowering time averages between 65 to 70 days.\n\n¬†\n¬†¬†7. Skins Skunk\n\nThis 60% indica-dominant hybrid from Loud Seeds is a result of years of work that started by pollinating an elite clone-only Afgoo found in Sonoma with a male Michigan Skunk. Selected and bred to the f4 generation, Skins Skunk produces generous yields of hashy smelling flowers with THC levels ranging from 17% to 21% and CBD levels up to 2%.\n\n¬†\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12002442/new-strains-alert-tigermelon-mt-hood-magic-kid-n-cookies-logic-di.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-tigermelon-mt-hood-magic-kid-n-cookies-logic-di"}],"reviewCount":2,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":55},{"name":"Strawberry","score":55},{"name":"Lemon","score":55},{"name":"Tar","score":5}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":55},{"name":"Happy","score":55},{"name":"Relaxed","score":55},{"name":"Sleepy","score":50},{"name":"Uplifted","score":50}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Cramps","score":60},{"name":"Pain","score":60},{"name":"Depression","score":55},{"name":"Insomnia","score":55},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":55}],"conditions":[{"name":"Arthritis","score":60},{"name":"Anxiety","score":55},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":50},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":50},{"name":"Asthma","score":5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Headache","score":50}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/skins-skunk_100x100_f977.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/480170/b/skins-skunk__primary_4ad5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/skins-skunk_100x100_2792.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/480078/b/skins-skunk__primary_0d0c.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skins-skunk","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afgoo","subtitle":null,"slug":"afgoo","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afgoo","symbol":"Afo","applink":"leafly://strain/afgoo"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":56,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
