Smooth light buzz. Mostly felt in the upper body, equally upper torso/shoulders and head. Very very relaxing, makes you forget what anxiety or stress is. After 45 min a mild sleepiness kick in if inactive.  In the action I did not feel any sleepiness and was able to focus and cook the family meal on autopilot.
