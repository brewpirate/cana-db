The blueberry attributes are very prevalent, Skunkberry has a great relaxing feeling and definitely helps with any pain you may have, and it does not make you feel too sleepy. It's a great after workout smoke. I really enjoy smoking this at the end of the day as a precursor to smoking before bed. It has an amazing body and head high. Kinda like being bathed solar radiation. ",
