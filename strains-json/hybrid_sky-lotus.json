Ladies and Gentlemen....Have you ever wanted to travel through space and time??? Oh, you have? Well you came to the right place! Sky Lotus will pick you up at a moments notice...all the admission is: one very small rip off the bong. Sky Lotus is a timely chauffeur, it will be at your beckon call within a minute...pulling up all smooth and sleek like. Once you get in, be sure and buckle the fuck up because Sky Lotus is driven by Elon Musk and he has Ludicrous Mode on this bitch! He doesn\u0027t give you much time to buckle up before pressing that powerful button. You are off, in this mind melting state of psychedelic fuckery. All senses are heightened while on this ride....to the point where I was feeling overwhelmed and turning in a bad trip. Well, on top of that, we also have Musky Boy at the front of this ship is practicing his barrel rolls and loopty loops, which at one point made me feel really dizzy and a little nauseous. At this point I am thinking \"wow, how are this high? Did I fuck up and do too much?? We need to turn around and head back to Earth!\". I was able to chill Elon out by putting on some chill music and laying my head down. This kept him from pulling those sick stunts and making me feel so disoriented. I then decided to take a nap while The Musk piloted us back to Earth. When I woke up, I was back. End effects was a stony, but calming sensation. Just glad I am back on Earth.\n\nJust be careful with this strain... it\u0027s a hefty bitch that hits hard (at least I had this experience). This being a new hybrid strain, I didn\u0027t know what to expect. I only did a little under a half a bowl in one rip and it kicked my ass into Oblivion.
