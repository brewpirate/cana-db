Good for creative endeavors and conversation, but not good for nighttime use or for those who tend to get a bit paranoid or anxiety-ridden.\r\n\r\nNot recommended for nighttime use (unless you want to stay up), as it promotes insomnia, a racing mind and a light, shallow sleep.\r\n\r\nIf you need a good, super clean sativa, for creative use, this is your strain.  If you are prone to anxiety in any way, this might bring about some slight paranoia, so keep that in mind. ",
