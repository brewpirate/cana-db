            "text": "Very potent and rapid-onset Sativa leaning Hybrid with surprisingly clear and mellow Indica afterglow. Novice users prone to panic and anxiety should exercise caution. Experienced users will be in for a treat! SBH will, without a doubt, cause some anxiety but it's up to you how to handle that aspect of it. Acknowledge the annoying beast for a minute or two, but don't go home with it, know what I mean? SBH is a better version of morning coffee/energy drink. If you're an artist/geek/nerd of any sort, you'll seriously fall in love with this. Even if you're not one of the creatives, you'll still reap some great benefits. \n\nAlthough it gets a bit intense at times, it's still very pleasant and very enjoyable experience. Listen to music, watch something funny, chat-up your friends/colleagues, SBH likes to be both introverted and extroverted at once. Creative? Write things, create things, they don't have to be good, just write all your ideas down, your brain will be flooded with an influx of new ideas and possibilities. \n\nSour Banana Sherbet outta be listed in Top 10 Ten Strains list every single year. I hope it doesn't get too cloned like Gorilla Glue and Bruce Banner have. Is it too intense to write  'PROTECT SOUR BANANA SHERBET AT ALL COST!'? Seriously -- This is such a lovely and uplifting strain that it would be a shame to lose it. A little bit of it goes a long way. Share it with the ones you love, don't abuse it, treat it like fine Wine. Bust it out as a Specialty, because that's what it falls under. \n\n---\n\nTL;DR - Tasty Sativa with a cerebral and uplifting high, suggested to experienced users. Get creative, go outside (or stay in, whatves brah), enjoy this gem.\n\nProudly served by Sira Naturals @ Somerville, Massachusetts.",
