Novice users prone to panic and anxiety should exercise caution. Experienced users will be in for a treat! SBH will, without a doubt, cause some anxiety but it\u0027s up to you how to handle that aspect of it. Acknowledge the annoying beast for a minute or two, but don\u0027t go home with it, know what I mean? SBH is a better version of morning coffee/energy drink. If you\u0027re an artist/geek/nerd of any sort, you\u0027ll seriously fall in love with this. Even if you\u0027re not one of the creatives, you\u0027ll still reap some great benefits. \n\nAlthough it gets a bit intense at times, it\u0027s still very pleasant and very enjoyable experience. Listen to music, watch something funny, chat-up your friends/colleagues, SBH likes to be both introverted and extroverted at once. Creative? Write things, create things, they don\u0027t have to be good, just write all your ideas down, your brain will be flooded with an influx of new ideas and possibilities. \n\nSour Banana Sherbet outta be listed in Top 10 Ten Strains list every single year. I hope it doesn\u0027t get too cloned like Gorilla Glue and Bruce Banner have. Is it too intense to write  \u0027PROTECT SOUR BANANA SHERBET AT ALL COST!\u0027? Seriously -- This is such a lovely and uplifting strain that it would be a shame to lose it. A little bit of it goes a long way. Share it with the ones you love, don\u0027t abuse it, treat it like fine Wine. Bust it out as a Specialty, because that\u0027s what it falls under. \n\n---\n\nTL;DR - Tasty Sativa with a cerebral and uplifting high, suggested to experienced users. Get creative, go outside (or stay in, whatves brah), enjoy this gem.\n\nProudly served by Sira Naturals @ Somerville, Massachusetts.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/naK3JvJVNYxIyCktBySx3sEEnao=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net%2fNHaJWFpYSytUVXxZgs4J5htt0xk%3d%2f120x120%2fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Fleafly-images%252Fuser-profile%252FO2lAGymyT1SM1TlbcVUV_Cool%2520Cat.jpg"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":103,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":32.606226114170504},{"name":"Diesel","score":18.492145887875779},{"name":"Honey","score":16.73286991062562},{"name":"Pungent","score":14.878802924979686},{"name":"Berry","score":14.307047636243267}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":84.72435376606181},{"name":"Happy","score":76.65658571815473},{"name":"Uplifted","score":70.2314856609792},{"name":"Euphoric","score":61.0273539767085},{"name":"Focused","score":58.375838825193341}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":50.096671782371878},{"name":"Depression","score":43.6971502512714},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":22.214573741386054},{"name":"Pain","score":21.110935572206671},{"name":"Fatigue","score":16.572627967861333}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":28.472284914688089},{"name":"PTSD","score":17.701844663115764},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":16.193840089073454},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":10.905103668261562},{"name":"Migraines","score":9.80146549908218}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":16.969847431615058},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":9.9872859679215189},{"name":"Anxious","score":7.7217056363034509},{"name":"Paranoid","score":3.7807318467695827},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.322184105202973}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-banana-sherbet_100x100_1e27.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002901/b/sour-banana-sherbet__primary_0db4.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-banana-sherbet_100x100_a6bd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002326/b/sour-banana-sherbet__primary_9486.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-banana-sherbet_100x100_2caf.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/621738/b/sour-banana-sherbet__primary_b462.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-banana-sherbet_100x100_d453.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/591343/b/sour-banana-sherbet__primary_444f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-banana-sherbet_100x100_d7c0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/589395/b/sour-banana-sherbet__primary_918e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-banana-sherbet_100x100_b406.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/582826/b/sour-banana-sherbet__primary_fda5.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":40,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Eugene, OR","Las Vegas, NV","Los Angeles, CA","Phoenix, AZ","Denver, CO","Hood River, OR","Mesa, AZ","Oregon City, OR","Salem, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-banana-sherbet","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.61165048543689/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
