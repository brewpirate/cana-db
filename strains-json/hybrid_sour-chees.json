            "text": "I've had the pleasure of tasting some very yummy Sour Cheese from Green Health Cooperative in Seattle, WA.  So yummy in fact that after trying it I had to return and get some more.  \n\nWhen you open the jar and take a whiff you are greeted with a splash of pungent sour that quickly turns into a smooth cheese.  Colored in a light to medium green and absolutely covered in orange hairs and glistening trichomes these buds are dense and cured to perfection.  The buds release a satisfying snap that throws trichomes into the air when broken from the stems.  \n\nI always blaze my flowers out of a bong and as usual with cheese, this has a thick yet very smooth smoke that doesn't leave you coughing.  As the effects set in you definitely feel a dryness to the eyes and mouth.  The high is very relaxed and not too heady, and after a few bowls my teeth were a bit tingly.  It is definitely a functional high.  I wouldn't say it was energetic, but I wasn't fatigued or \"couch-locked\" at all.  \n\nI happen to try this at the end of a sinus.. thing.   This bud will dry up your entire head, so if you have sinus issues (allergies) that leave your nose runny be aware of that.   I would definitely recommend trying some of this delicious bud.",
