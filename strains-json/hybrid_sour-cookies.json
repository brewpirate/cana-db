(WA)\n\nThis is by far my favorite GSC cross.  Very dense and slow burning, triangular heavily trichomed nugs.  The taste of this strain is perfect, just the right amount of sour, sweet, chocolate, diesel.  The effects are extremely balanced.  Leafly\u0027s description is fairly accurate.  I\u0027m very relaxed , yet very alert.  I would recommend this strain to anyone who likes weed. Look at it, smell it, smoke it.  It won\u0027t upset.
