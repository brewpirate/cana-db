            "text": "I put this more in the Indica side of a hybrid or a 50/50 balance based on the phenotype I experienced. Classic cannabis taste thats sour and little skunky with smooth herbal and berry undertones. Mellow high. It can be blended with anything when dabbing which is I think the Indica / Sativa ratio is balanced. It works well for ADD/ADHD but needs more Sativa to be a full time medicine. Works well for stress and anxiety from PTSD. Not a huge stand out but it\u2019s one of those versatile stains, like blue cookies, that just goes with everything. ",
