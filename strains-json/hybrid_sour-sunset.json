First off, the buds look absolutely gorgeous. Crazy huge trichomes, beautiful pale orange pistils, nice fat calyxes, and an overall amazing size, shape, and density. The smell is orgasmic! You get the classic Sunset Sherbet flavor and smell, but with a slight hint of sour fruit and gasoline. This strain is just stupid potent. My tolerance is through the roof, but every time I smoke this shit I always get ridiculously high in the best of ways! It hits hard and fast like its Sour Diesel parent, but also builds in strength over the course of about 10-15 minutes. The peak last a surprisingly long time, about an hour and a half depending on how much you smoke, and it lasts a total of 3-3 1/2 hours!! The euphoria is ungodly strong, as is the painkilling effect and the mental stimulation. Very uplifting head high and gentle body high for the peak, and a powerfully sedating body high that puts you into a state of deep relaxation for the rest of the high and lingers throughout the day without causing fatigue. Sour Sunset is one of those strains where you know that you\u0027ll be good all day from just one or two small bowls. I do warn the cannabis-naive and those with lower tolerance to be VERY CAREFUL about how much you smoke in one sitting. Yeah you feel high almost immediately, but it still creeps up on you and sometimes gets overwhelming. 5/5 and my absolute favorite strain!!!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1590550,"username":"GreatScott2115","text":"Just when I think it can\u0027t get any better, I come across a strain that absolutely knocks my socks off!  This strain has recently made an appearance at a few dispensaries in my neck of the woods.  Went to a dispensary a few days ago for a different strain but was recommended this by the awesome bud-tender so I said what the hell, let\u0027s do it.  Glad I did. \n Whoa is this one powerful!  Vaped an RSO cartridge and after 4 pulls I was on cloud 9.  Btw, Leafly... Srs is definitely sativa dominate, not indica dominate as it states in the description.  It has a slightly sweet taste with strong diesel notes. This is, hands down the most aroused I\u0027ve been with any strain I\u0027ve tried so far.  Extremely euphoric!  I am very focused and clear headed.  I could lay in bed listening to music all day or I could take advantage of the wonderfully warm weather that we\u0027ve been having and do some yard work!  Take a look at my favorite strains, they aren\u0027t all my favorites, they are just all the strains I\u0027ve tried thus far.  This is the bees knees, Peeps!   It\u0027s at the top of my list!  Give it a try, I think you\u0027ll be pleased.  (I can\u0027t believe how focused I am.  I am literally thinking about my childhood and the images are so vivid and clear!)","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":38,"flavors":[{"name":"Diesel","score":72.556818181818187},{"name":"Sweet","score":69.886363636363626},{"name":"Citrus","score":14.090909090909092},{"name":"Tropical","score":9.0909090909090917},{"name":"Skunk","score":9.0909090909090917}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":98.068181818181813},{"name":"Euphoric","score":96.818181818181813},{"name":"Uplifted","score":85.85227272727272},{"name":"Creative","score":78.181818181818187},{"name":"Happy","score":78.011363636363626}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":24.886363636363633},{"name":"Depression","score":20.965909090909093},{"name":"Pain","score":17.215909090909093},{"name":"Fatigue","score":9.5454545454545467},{"name":"Headaches","score":6.8750000000000009}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":12.045454545454547},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":7.0454545454545459},{"name":"PTSD","score":6.4204545454545459},{"name":"Hypertension","score":5.7954545454545459},{"name":"Arthritis","score":2.5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":65.9659090909091},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":54.375},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.625},{"name":"Headache","score":0.625},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.625}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-sunset_100x100_d80a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/654411/b/sour-sunset__primary_ea0c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-sunset_100x100_a79d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/588276/b/sour-sunset__primary_ede2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-sunset_100x100_b61a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/566385/b/sour-sunset__primary_8673.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-sunset_100x100_26f9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/518508/b/sour-sunset__primary_7ee5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-sunset_100x100_926b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/506398/b/sour-sunset__primary_81ac.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-sunset_100x100_caae.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/506272/b/sour-sunset__primary_38c6.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":14,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Denver, CO","San Diego, CA","Seattle, WA","Bend, OR","Salem, OR","Ann Arbor, MI","Cathedral City, CA","Clearlake, CA","Everett, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.71052631578947/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Sour Diesel","subtitle":null,"slug":"sour-diesel","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/sour-diesel","symbol":"Sd","applink":"leafly://strain/sour-diesel"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
