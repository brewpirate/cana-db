Available since 2006, this strain is the work of TGA Seeds and placed in the Top 10 at the 2009 High Times Cannabis Cup. Space Bomb will produce beautiful lime green buds with orange throughout. The buds will have a fruit candy smell with a little bit of that sweet-rot smell when they flower at 7-8 weeks&mdash;a true speed queen for a sativa. Yields will be average, but the buds are potent and covered in trichomes.</p>\n",
