Some are entirely new to the market, while others are simply perennial favorites that we can\u2019t recommend enough. Below, find our crew\u2019s favorite cannabis concentrates of 2017. How many have you tried? What was\u00a0your\u00a0favorite concentrate of 2017? Share with us in the comments below!\n\nDouble Tangie Banana Sugar Resin by Oleum Extracts\nAvailable in: Washington\nBursting with citrus aroma, Oleum Extracts\u2019 delicious Double Tangie Banana Sugar Resin brings maximum flavor along with buzzy sativa-dominant qualities.

When pressed on a hot dab nail, THCA decarboxylates into strong and active THC. With little to no terpene content in a crystalline distillate, the rush is smooth and tasteless, and these crystals can be added to standard dabs for an intense high-potency experience (trust us, it\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re taking your first dab all over again).\n\nTropical Trainwreck 1g Kit by Orchid Essentials\nAvailable in: California and Oregon\nLeafly\u2019s office is located in Seattle, which means we clamor for any product that lets us escape from the clouds and rain.
