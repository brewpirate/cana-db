            "text": "Loose little buds that did not taste nor smell very appetizing. Good for mixing up in salads with other more tasty strains. For a hybrid the buzz was decent with both a strong pull towards the head and also body.  This can feel strangulating if these feelings overlap which is often why I deter from hybrids.  This was not the case with Special K at all, but instead a balanced back & forth between.  Good for light pain relief without being super giggly or anxious.",
