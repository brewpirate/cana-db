Good for mixing up in salads with other more tasty strains. For a hybrid the buzz was decent with both a strong pull towards the head and also body.  This can feel strangulating if these feelings overlap which is often why I deter from hybrids.  This was not the case with Special K at all, but instead a balanced back \u0026 forth between.  Good for light pain relief without being super giggly or anxious.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3301","title":"New Strains Alert: Green Dragon, Purple Maui, Sour Bubble, Special K, and Strawberry Satori","author":"Kayla Williams","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1410537600000)\/","text":"Sometimes strains are bred by chance, offering us a delectable surprise we grow to cherish.
