            "text": "Independence Day is just one day away! At this point, you\u2019ve already cleaned out your local grocery store\u2019s chips, hot dogs, watermelons, and possibly several cases of beer. Your fireworks have been acquired. Your friends have been invited over. You\u2019re ready for the weekend. But which strains will you consume?\nYou can\u2019t just celebrate our nation\u2019s birth with any old strain, and why would you when there are so many festive options to choose from! Whether you\u2019re looking for an uplifting strain or something a little more mellow, these patriotic strains are just the ticket to ring in America\u2019s 239th birthday!\nSpirit of \u201876\n\nNothing better to get you into the spirit of the holiday than Spirit of \u201976! This hybrid hails from Denver, Colorado and boasts a relaxed, uplifted high that will give you the energy you\u2019ll need to make it through a long day of celebration. It\u2019s also particularly well-suited to stimulating appetites, which will give you an added boost to eat that extra hot dog!\nLiberty Haze\n\nThis High Times Cannabis Cup winner offers a refreshing summer lime taste and has lab-tested THC results as high as 25%. An uplifting, energetic hybrid offers heady, cerebral effects that are great at combating anxiety and depression to help ensure your spirits are lifted the whole day through. This strain promises an excellent day of celebration, with liberty and justice for all.\nDanky Doodle\n\nSay what you will about the cannabis industry and puns, we\u2019re still suckers for good wordplay, and Danky Doodle is just that. Originally named Double D in reference to its large buds (we\u2019ll let you make the connection there), the breeder decided to rename the strain to Danky Doodle so as not to confuse it with Double Dutch. This strain provides the full body relief you\u2019ve come to expect with indicas, but it has a lighter, uplifted high then most. It\u2019s the perfect option to provide the pain relief you need without locking you to your couch during the day\u2019s festivities.\nAmerican Kush\n\nGod bless America(n Kush)! This indica boasts a pungent, skunky flavor profile with hints of lemon to spicy notes of lavender and coffee. Patients will benefit from the pain-relieving properties that are known to treat muscle spasms, chronic pain, and nausea. Recreational consumers will love its relaxed, euphoric high. And if you\u2019re looking for a little help eating that last piece of watermelon, the hunger-inducing properties are just for you!\nCherry Bomb\n\nWould it really be the 4th of July without some fireworks? This hybrid isn\u2019t quite as explosive as the firecracker that shares its name, but its happy, uplifted, energetic effects will ensure you\u2019re ready to enjoy the magnificent explosions you\u2019ll no doubt witness. Within moments of your first puff, you\u2019ll feel the strong and active, mentally alert effects that will eventually give way to a smooth, more focused state that will keep you going through the show.\nPresidential OG\n\nOnce the festivities conclude and you\u2019re looking to settle in for a good night\u2019s sleep, Presidential OG is just the strain for you. Almost purely indica, this hard-hitting cross between Bubble Gum and OG Kush will melt your cares away, lulling you into slumber almost immediately (but not before you have a moment to enjoy the intense citrus-pine aroma this dreamy strain omits).\nThere you have it, folks! These strains bleed red, white, and blue, and are everything you\u2019ll need to usher your way through this 4th of July. From all of us at Leafly to you, Happy Independence Day!",

            "text": "Thanks to all of those who submitted new strain requests via the Leafly app this week! Here are five of the most popular submissions we received, so give them a rating and review if you've tried them.\nRemember, you can check to see if these strains are available near you by clicking the \"Availability\" tab on our website and app, so go out there and find these new additions to try!\n\u00a0 \u00a01. Spirit of '76\nCharacteristics of Spirit of '76:\n\nSpirit of 76 is a hybrid bred by Kindman out of Denver, CO, who closely guard the genetic heritage of their proprietary strains. It is known for having hints of purple coloring and a fruity bouquet of flavors ranging from sweet notes of fruit punch to the piney musk associated with Kush strains. Spirit of 76\u2019s earthy taste finishes with notes of grape and lavender flavors that usher in balanced effects, which are great for relaxing, calming anxieties, and stimulating the appetite.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a02. Blue Knight\nCharacteristics of Blue Knight:\n\nBlue Knight is a rare indica-dominant strain with a noble lineage that stems from Blueberry and Kryptonite genetics. Hues of royal purple twist with deep blues and vivid greens in a visual display as multifaceted as its berry, vanilla aroma. Earthy, woody, and blueberry flavors are unleashed on the exhale, and the relaxing full-body effects that follow are often enough to soothe pain and stimulate the appetite.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Alpha Blue\nCharacteristics of Alpha Blue:\n\n\u200bAlpha Blue, also known as Dream Diesel (or DD), is a high-flying sativa that combines Blue Dream and Sour Diesel. In 2011 this compelling blend claimed two 2nd place prizes for a sativa at the High Times\u2019 Medical Cup in Denver and San Francisco. Its buds are glazed with sugary trichomes and take on hues of deep red and violet. The aroma is a combination of tart\u00a0blueberry\u00a0and sour candy that create a\u00a0pungent\u00a0mixture of earthy berry and Haze upon exhale. The sweet fragrance of Alpha Blue brings with it uplifting effects that produce a calming, relaxed mood without putting you to sleep. The cerebral and happy buzz is a great tool when coping with stress and anxiety.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a04. Sugar Black Rose\nCharacteristics of Sugar Black Rose:\n\nSugar Black Rose is a cross of Critical+ and Black Domina bred by Delicious Seeds. An indica-dominant hybrid, Sugar Black Rose has a sweet taste with hints of fruit and fresh flowers. The aroma takes on a pungent, earthy musk that resembles exotic hash imported from overseas, and brings with it a relaxing body buzz that helps keep nausea, anxiety, and muscle pains at bay.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a05. Chucky's Bride\nCharacteristics of Chucky's Bride:\n\nChucky\u2019s Bride is a cross of Exodus Cheese and Cinderella 99 bred by Eskobar Seeds. This sativa-dominant hybrid gives off an exotic mixture of sharp flavors. Cinderella 99\u2019s tropical aroma of sweet citrus and pineapple blend with the pungent notes of skunky cheese that have become synonymous with Cheese strains. The unique terpene profile leads a charge of uplifting and creative effects that stimulate the appetite\u00a0and ward off depression.",
