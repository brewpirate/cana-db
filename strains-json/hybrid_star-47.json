These stains were bred together by World of Seeds (seed) Bank.

It starts off slow, comes on strong, and finishes with heavenly euphoria, relaxation, low riding eyes, and yet a surprisingly fogless, and creative mind amongst it all. the longer i sit here, the more my anxiety melts away. The scent is a pungent sour/citrus and a freshly opened box of fruit loops. The taste is somewhat sour and earthy which i believe to be the ak47 genetics. For those seeking a beautiful indica dominant hybrid with that nice sativa kick, Star 47 is definitely recommended by me. ",
