    "description": "<p>Star Pupil by Mass Medical Strains is a hybrid with mysterious genetics. The supposed cross of <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thai\">Thai</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani\">Afghani</a> was bred from seeds originally gifted to the breeder. Star Pupil develops colorful and exotic foliage, steeped in purple hues and fresh resin. The strain&rsquo;s aroma is a complex melange of skunk, grape, and perfume that transforms into a clean and thick flavor. It has an approximate 9-week flowering time and gains colorful bag appeal as the plant matures.</p>\n",
