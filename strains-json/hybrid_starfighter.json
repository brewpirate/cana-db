So come along! Now, lettuce talk about the buds. They allllmost have purple. It was somewhat confusing, because the sample buds i was shown i swore had abundances purple... I think. But alas, the buds i was given at point of sale were perhaps from another part of the plant or grow or w/e etc, and showed only faint, faint traces of purple. Just some. But, BUT, Trichome, resin, density, smell, and aesthetics wise, these were proper, proper flowers. The buds are dense, healthy, wet, frosted, hairy, and potent. Upon smoke of a .5g, Raw paper and crutch joint, I noticed several things. Firstly, I was awestruck by the ease of break-up into the joint. When squeezed and palpitated, the buds burst into a fine, even silt that left your fingers snowing, and crackled very distinctly when drawn upon. This was a really, really premium smoke. Harvested sometime around early, early 2016, i would wager. Top marks to The Farm growers <3 And their employees! Bought from a truly nice dude and crew. \n\nPurchased in Boulder CO 2/16. Find, grow, and or smoke this, wherever you are, dear reader, and fellow toker.",
