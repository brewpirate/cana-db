Very mellow smoke, nice banana taste. The flower i got was 24.6% THC and i gotta say, i was impressed by the effects. Nice mellow affects that lasted me all morning, very nice way to start your mornings. However, i missed that giggly and happy feeling. I got more of a calm, focused feeling from it. Still a great strain. ",

It smelled up my whole room with a citrusy berry aroma just from opening the bag!\n\nGotta be careful with this one, if you\u2019re prone to racing thoughts with strong Sativas like me, take it a bit easy until you\u2019ve gotten use to it. \nMade the mistake of smoking a fat ass joint all to myself and I started getting flustered over silly thoughts. \n\nTry the 4-7-8 breathing technique. (Inhale for 4 seconds, hold it for 7, and exhale for 8)\n tell yourself that you don\u2019t need to think about that junk. And that you are NOT running away from problems. These racing anxious thoughts are silly, mundane, and that YOU have control over uncomfortable thoughts. ",
