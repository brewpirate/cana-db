And the flavor is just as great. Very mellow smoke, nice banana taste. The flower i got was 24.6% THC and i gotta say, i was impressed by the effects. Nice mellow affects that lasted me all morning, very nice way to start your mornings. However, i missed that giggly and happy feeling. I got more of a calm, focused feeling from it. Still a great strain.
