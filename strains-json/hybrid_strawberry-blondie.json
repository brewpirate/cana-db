The strawberry flavor really shines out while smoking it, AND lingers around well after.  Delicious. Very relaxing effects without the \"couch lock\" feeling.  If anything, you\u0027ll just fall asleep.  Fruity, sweet, smoke with some OG (of course) pungency.  I\u0027d recommend anything that this company makes, especially this \"Strawberry Blondie\".","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"},{"id":1629100,"username":"Xbvnny","text":"Strawberry Blondie is my favorite strain üôÇ it tastes just like it smells!!
