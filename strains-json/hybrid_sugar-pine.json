    "description": "<p>Sugar Pine has been a work in progress for the last two decades, crossing and backcrossing specific cannabis genetics to compose an ideal sativa-dominant hybrid that is simultaneously uplifting and soothing. Produced by Flying Dutchman Gardens, Sugar Pine is an eclectic hybrid with genetics that include <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1\">Skunk</a>, Sugar Bush, <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani\">Afghani</a>, and Sweetie. This strain&rsquo;s aroma is indicative of its name, stinking of sweet pine, with notes of hops and vanilla. The buzz is uplifting and cerebral while remaining light and easy on the body.&nbsp;</p>\n",
