    "description": "<p>Sugar Shack is a moderate, indica-dominant hybrid. Great for nighttime or evening use, this strain provides users with a mild head and body-heavy sensation. Be careful, though, because too much Sugar Shack will put you right to sleep. If you&rsquo;re looking to increase appetite, Sugar Shack is also a great strain to try. Like its name suggests, this strain features a slightly sweet taste and scent that verges on piney and herbal. A good strain for beginning cannabis users, Sugar Shack is mild yet gets the job done.</p>\n",

Its kind of a cross between couch glue and ambitiony where you'll make great plans to do something but also may not.\r\n\r\nSound and high stress might wig you out in a funny (not scary) way. My smoking buddy was eating ice cream and the door slammed due to wind and he thought it was a gunshot which led to all kinds of funny paranoia.\r\n\r\nI paid 15$ for an 1/8th and worth every penny.\r\n\r\nLasts the standard 90 mins and the burnout is mellow and drives you back to it.
