Recipes and Strain Suggestions for the Big Game","author":"Rebecca Kelley","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1422727200000)\/","text":"Well folks, the “we have to call it the ‘Big Game’ because that other name is trademarked but we all know what the ‘Big Game’ actually refers to” is taking place this Sunday in sunny Houston, Texas. For those of you who are football fans, absurdly expensive commercial fans, or just fans of hanging out with your friends so you can chow down on food and vape your favorite strain while they shake their fists and scream obscenities at the television, here’s a list of some cannabis-infused recipes and strains to make Sunday even more “Super.”\nCannabis-Infused Recipes for the Big Football Game\n1. Cannabis-Infused Chipotle Avocado Baked Macaroni and Cheese\n\nWho doesn’t love mac and cheese? This homey dish of cannabis-infused cheesy, creamy deliciousness will warm the bellies of your friends as they watch the Patriots and Falcons face off.\n2. Cannabis-Infused Cucumber Avocado Dip\n\nDips are their own genre of food when it comes to watching sports. This recipe for infused cucumber avocado dip is deceptively healthy but definitely delicious.\n3. Cannabis-Infused Guacamole\n\nSpeaking of dips, guacamole is a must-have at any championship viewing party. But what’s better than guacamole? Cannabis-infused guacamole, of course!\n4. Cannabis-Infused Hummus\n\nThree infused dip recipes? Why the heck not? Pair this infused hummus with some pita chips or crudité, or smear it onto chicken feta sliders.\n5. Cannabis-Infused Pesto Pizza\n\nWhip up a few pizzas with different topping combinations for instant viewing party MVP status.\n6. Cannabis-Infused Coleslaw\n\nIf you’re going the BBQ route, this side dish of cannabis-infused coleslaw makes a pairing as perfect as Brady and Belichick.\n7. Cannabis-Infused Bacon\n\nHonestly, it doesn’t matter what you do with this – it’s cannabis-infused bacon, for crying out loud. Wrap it around dates and roast them so they look like little footballs (laces out!). Make some bacon cheeseburgers. Or just put out a tray of cannabis-infused bacon – after all, bacon is pretty damn delicious.\nNote: Dosing homemade edibles can be tricky (click here to learn why), so the best way to test for potency is to start with one portion of a serving, wait one to two hours, then make an informed decision on whether to consume more. Always dose carefully and listen to your body, and never drive under the influence of cannabis.\nCannabis Strains to Pick Up for the Big Game\n1. Peaches and Cream\n\nWith this guaranteed good-mood hybrid strain, notes reminiscent of sweet Georgia peaches come through in a flavor profile that Atlanta fans will absolutely appreciate.\n2. American Kush\n\nFor Patriots fans, this star-spangled indica delivers happy, tingly effects to match how you’ll feel if Brady and Belichick do it again.\n3. Southern Lights\n\nFor all you Falcons fans, this smoothly smokable sativa relaxes your body and sharpens your mind, letting you take it all in from the comfort of any given couch.\n4. Kaboom\n\nWhenever anyone takes a big hit, take an equally big hit of this lemony sativa.\n5. Super Silver Haze\n\nSilver is a tertiary color for both teams headed to Houston, and come Sunday those silver accents are going to be looking pretty super. Even better, this popular sativa will deliver the energy needed to pump you up for the opening kickoff.\n6. Champagne Kush\n\nTreachoself! When the fourth quarter clock reaches zero and the Gatorade is dumped on the winning coach, bust out this uplifting flowery hybrid and celebrate in style.\n\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=”http://polldaddy.com/poll/8622212/”\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Who do you think will win the 2015 NFL Championship?\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/11235908/are-you-ready-for-some-football-recipes-and-strain-suggestions-fo.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/are-you-ready-for-some-football-recipes-and-strain-suggestions-fo"}],"reviewCount":217,"flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","score":35.909090909090907},{"name":"Sweet","score":9.454545454545455},{"name":"Berry","score":5.2727272727272734},{"name":"Tea","score":2.3636363636363638},{"name":"Tree Fruit","score":2.1818181818181817}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":42.454545454545453},{"name":"Uplifted","score":40.63636363636364},{"name":"Energetic","score":38.090909090909093},{"name":"Focused","score":38.090909090909093},{"name":"Hungry","score":37.909090909090907}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Fatigue","score":28.818181818181817},{"name":"Stress","score":11.727272727272727},{"name":"Depression","score":6.3636363636363642},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":4.0909090909090908},{"name":"Nausea","score":3.7272727272727275}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":8.454545454545455},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":4.1818181818181817},{"name":"PTSD","score":3.4545454545454546},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":3.4545454545454546},{"name":"PMS","score":2.8181818181818183}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":10.363636363636363},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":6.8181818181818183},{"name":"Headache","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Dizzy","score":3.2727272727272725},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_49f9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002873/b/super-blue-dream__primary_f75f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_1f1d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619052/b/super-blue-dream__primary_d4ba.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_6795.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/577559/b/super-blue-dream__primary_311d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_b830.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/553376/b/super-blue-dream__primary_7ef2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_b8ee.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/541365/b/super-blue-dream__primary_b2a8.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_0cf3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494778/b/super-blue-dream__primary_1f85.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":54,"popularCities":["Bremerton, WA","Cathlamet, WA","Eugene, OR","Fallon, NV","Issaquah, WA","Kelso, WA","Kirkland, WA","Las Vegas, NV","Longview, WA","Los Angeles, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/super-blue-dream","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.30414746543779/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Super Silver Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"super-silver-haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/super-silver-haze","symbol":"Ss","applink":"leafly://strain/super-silver-haze"},{"name":"Blue Dream","subtitle":null,"slug":"blue-dream","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-dream","symbol":"Bd","applink":"leafly://strain/blue-dream"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Recipes and Strain Suggestions for the Big Game","author":"Rebecca Kelley","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1422727200000)\/","text":"Well folks, the “we have to call it the ‘Big Game’ because that other name is trademarked but we all know what the ‘Big Game’ actually refers to” is taking place this Sunday in sunny Houston, Texas. For those of you who are football fans, absurdly expensive commercial fans, or just fans of hanging out with your friends so you can chow down on food and vape your favorite strain while they shake their fists and scream obscenities at the television, here’s a list of some cannabis-infused recipes and strains to make Sunday even more “Super.”\nCannabis-Infused Recipes for the Big Football Game\n1. Cannabis-Infused Chipotle Avocado Baked Macaroni and Cheese\n\nWho doesn’t love mac and cheese? This homey dish of cannabis-infused cheesy, creamy deliciousness will warm the bellies of your friends as they watch the Patriots and Falcons face off.\n2. Cannabis-Infused Cucumber Avocado Dip\n\nDips are their own genre of food when it comes to watching sports. This recipe for infused cucumber avocado dip is deceptively healthy but definitely delicious.\n3. Cannabis-Infused Guacamole\n\nSpeaking of dips, guacamole is a must-have at any championship viewing party. But what’s better than guacamole? Cannabis-infused guacamole, of course!\n4. Cannabis-Infused Hummus\n\nThree infused dip recipes? Why the heck not? Pair this infused hummus with some pita chips or crudité, or smear it onto chicken feta sliders.\n5. Cannabis-Infused Pesto Pizza\n\nWhip up a few pizzas with different topping combinations for instant viewing party MVP status.\n6. Cannabis-Infused Coleslaw\n\nIf you’re going the BBQ route, this side dish of cannabis-infused coleslaw makes a pairing as perfect as Brady and Belichick.\n7. Cannabis-Infused Bacon\n\nHonestly, it doesn’t matter what you do with this – it’s cannabis-infused bacon, for crying out loud. Wrap it around dates and roast them so they look like little footballs (laces out!). Make some bacon cheeseburgers. Or just put out a tray of cannabis-infused bacon – after all, bacon is pretty damn delicious.\nNote: Dosing homemade edibles can be tricky (click here to learn why), so the best way to test for potency is to start with one portion of a serving, wait one to two hours, then make an informed decision on whether to consume more. Always dose carefully and listen to your body, and never drive under the influence of cannabis.\nCannabis Strains to Pick Up for the Big Game\n1. Peaches and Cream\n\nWith this guaranteed good-mood hybrid strain, notes reminiscent of sweet Georgia peaches come through in a flavor profile that Atlanta fans will absolutely appreciate.\n2. American Kush\n\nFor Patriots fans, this star-spangled indica delivers happy, tingly effects to match how you’ll feel if Brady and Belichick do it again.\n3. Southern Lights\n\nFor all you Falcons fans, this smoothly smokable sativa relaxes your body and sharpens your mind, letting you take it all in from the comfort of any given couch.\n4. Kaboom\n\nWhenever anyone takes a big hit, take an equally big hit of this lemony sativa.\n5. Super Silver Haze\n\nSilver is a tertiary color for both teams headed to Houston, and come Sunday those silver accents are going to be looking pretty super. Even better, this popular sativa will deliver the energy needed to pump you up for the opening kickoff.\n6. Champagne Kush\n\nTreachoself! When the fourth quarter clock reaches zero and the Gatorade is dumped on the winning coach, bust out this uplifting flowery hybrid and celebrate in style.\n\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=”http://polldaddy.com/poll/8622212/”\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Who do you think will win the 2015 NFL Championship?\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/11235908/are-you-ready-for-some-football-recipes-and-strain-suggestions-fo.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/are-you-ready-for-some-football-recipes-and-strain-suggestions-fo"}],"reviewCount":217,"flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","score":35.909090909090907},{"name":"Sweet","score":9.454545454545455},{"name":"Berry","score":5.2727272727272734},{"name":"Tea","score":2.3636363636363638},{"name":"Tree Fruit","score":2.1818181818181817}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":42.454545454545453},{"name":"Uplifted","score":40.63636363636364},{"name":"Energetic","score":38.090909090909093},{"name":"Focused","score":38.090909090909093},{"name":"Hungry","score":37.909090909090907}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Fatigue","score":28.818181818181817},{"name":"Stress","score":11.727272727272727},{"name":"Depression","score":6.3636363636363642},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":4.0909090909090908},{"name":"Nausea","score":3.7272727272727275}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":8.454545454545455},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":4.1818181818181817},{"name":"PTSD","score":3.4545454545454546},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":3.4545454545454546},{"name":"PMS","score":2.8181818181818183}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":10.363636363636363},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":6.8181818181818183},{"name":"Headache","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Dizzy","score":3.2727272727272725},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_49f9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002873/b/super-blue-dream__primary_f75f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_1f1d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/619052/b/super-blue-dream__primary_d4ba.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_6795.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/577559/b/super-blue-dream__primary_311d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_b830.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/553376/b/super-blue-dream__primary_7ef2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_b8ee.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/541365/b/super-blue-dream__primary_b2a8.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-blue-dream_100x100_0cf3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494778/b/super-blue-dream__primary_1f85.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":54,"popularCities":["Bremerton, WA","Cathlamet, WA","Eugene, OR","Fallon, NV","Issaquah, WA","Kelso, WA","Kirkland, WA","Las Vegas, NV","Longview, WA","Los Angeles, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/super-blue-dream","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.30414746543779/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Super Silver Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"super-silver-haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/super-silver-haze","symbol":"Ss","applink":"leafly://strain/super-silver-haze"},{"name":"Blue Dream","subtitle":null,"slug":"blue-dream","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-dream","symbol":"Bd","applink":"leafly://strain/blue-dream"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
