            "text": "Being the 4th strain I've ever tried, man I gotta tell ya, I did a lot of this. Probably more than I should've. Now from a two-day experience of smoking this all day with a friend, I think I know a good amount about this strain to leave a review. (Btw I am not a regular stoner so I have no tolerance) The experience first started with me doing several hits of the pen which started fairly easy. Then as I did more, I began to cough. A cough that the strain gives you isn't very harsh to handle but once you start coughing, you should give it a quick break because continuing can make things go south. (At one point I did 5 hits without inhaling oxygen and I honestly wanted to die for a good 3 minutes). After 1-10 minutes, it starts with a slow but nice euphoria and/or body high like gravity has become slightly heavier. Then you will begin to feel the other effects like a creativity boost, possibly more energy, At low to medium doses this makes for a great time that is chill yet fun. You won't be couch locked though it might be a little bit more fun on the couch. Munchies isn't huge but it does happen. Again at low doses you can still function, your high is controllable and you can focus on specific things better. You could have a great time on your phone or space out, just depends on your mood which I love. Though this becomes much harder at higher doses, the higher the more psychedelic and in my opinion not very positive. Your vision will start to flicker and you will be able to imagine(not see but in your mind) weird patterns and fractals. In my experience, I started to see a series of photos, went to bed dreaming about them and woke up to them, still thinking about them. They aren't very memorable but they look extremely familiar. They are just random things like shapes and trees. Though I did remember my cousin became my uncle for a solid 5 minutes and then closed eye visuals and shit. Might sound cool but in my opinion was not fun. Do not overdo as it isn't very harsh but will ruin your night, and will leave you with a terrible hangover. Stick to a medium amount for a really great, euphoric high. Tastes pretty good, still prefer skywalker OG though. All in all would definitely do this again but I would avoid overdoing it.",
