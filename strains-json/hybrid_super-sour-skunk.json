The aroma of the buds is incredible. Rich sour citrus undercut with fuel and musky skunk fills your nostrils and makes your mouth water. \nThe smoke is a little more dominant on the diesel side. Very rich, tingly and tasty. Quite smooth as well. Very satisfying smoke overall.\nThe high is everything I want in a daytime smoke. I feel very euphoric and energetic. My mood is lifted. I feel no stress and aches and pains are gone. Most importantly, I feel decisive and focussed. I feel more outgoing, social, and motivated. \nIâ€™d recommend this one to veteran smokers, especially Indica enthusiasts who need a reliable daytime smoke. Sativa dominant strains often make me overly stimulated or anxious but Super Sour Skunk definitely hits a sweet spot. 5/5.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/YEN1LqXiYCOvWiFhmP-4p67iqDM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fY9fB9qHySLml8016ysgJ_goggles-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":49,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":28.879310344827587},{"name":"Skunk","score":28.448275862068964},{"name":"Earthy","score":28.017241379310345},{"name":"Diesel","score":27.155172413793103},{"name":"Sweet","score":26.293103448275861}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":135.77586206896552},{"name":"Uplifted","score":131.89655172413794},{"name":"Euphoric","score":131.0344827586207},{"name":"Relaxed","score":130.60344827586206},{"name":"Giggly","score":106.46551724137932}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":128.87931034482759},{"name":"Stress","score":105.60344827586206},{"name":"Depression","score":105.17241379310344},{"name":"Fatigue","score":103.01724137931035},{"name":"Insomnia","score":25.431034482758619}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":103.01724137931035},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":101.72413793103448},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":25},{"name":"Migraines","score":1.2931034482758621},{"name":"PTSD","score":1.2931034482758621}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":52.1551724137931},{"name":"Anxious","score":50.862068965517238},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":27.586206896551722},{"name":"Paranoid","score":0.86206896551724133},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.43103448275862066}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-sour-skunk_100x100_d5f5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/577744/b/super-sour-skunk__primary_a5b4.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-sour-skunk_100x100_2114.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/577743/b/super-sour-skunk__primary_7548.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-sour-skunk_100x100_c130.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522722/b/super-sour-skunk__primary_c7f4.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-sour-skunk_100x100_ff6a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/512011/b/super-sour-skunk__primary_fe08.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-sour-skunk_100x100_6c4c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/507808/b/super-sour-skunk__primary_c885.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-sour-skunk_100x100_eca6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/485934/b/super-sour-skunk__primary_52e1.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":10,"popularCities":["Bremerton, WA","Gardena, CA","Los Angeles, CA","Renton, WA","Spanaway, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/super-sour-skunk","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.48979591836735/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"East Coast Sour Diesel","subtitle":null,"slug":"east-coast-sour-diesel","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/east-coast-sour-diesel","symbol":"Eas","applink":"leafly://strain/east-coast-sour-diesel"},{"name":"Super Skunk","subtitle":null,"slug":"super-skunk","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/super-skunk","symbol":"Ssk","applink":"leafly://strain/super-skunk"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\t10-11 weeks flowering\n\n"}}
