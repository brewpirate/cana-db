            "text": "Super Sour Skunk has everything I look for in a Sativa Hybrid. The aroma of the buds is incredible. Rich sour citrus undercut with fuel and musky skunk fills your nostrils and makes your mouth water. \nThe smoke is a little more dominant on the diesel side. Very rich, tingly and tasty. Quite smooth as well. Very satisfying smoke overall.\nThe high is everything I want in a daytime smoke. I feel very euphoric and energetic. My mood is lifted. I feel no stress and aches and pains are gone. Most importantly, I feel decisive and focussed. I feel more outgoing, social, and motivated. \nI\u2019d recommend this one to veteran smokers, especially Indica enthusiasts who need a reliable daytime smoke. Sativa dominant strains often make me overly stimulated or anxious but Super Sour Skunk definitely hits a sweet spot. 5/5.",
