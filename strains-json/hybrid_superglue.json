            "text": "Every year we like to look back and recognize the rising stars of the cannabis world. Last year, GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4), Critical Kush, Candyland, and ACDC were among the fastest trending\u00a0strains according to Leafly user strain reviews, but which strains stood out from the crowd this year?\nTo eliminate outliers that might skew the results, we restricted our search to the top 200 ranking strains of 2016. These strains tend to be more available nationwide, and we hope you\u2019re able to find them in your area!\nBudtenders and inventory managers \u2013 are these trending strains on your menu? If not, consider keeping an eye out for them. Because in 2016, they were flying off the shelves fast.\n\n#10.\u00a0Blue Cookies\n\nWe all know that customers swarm around anything containing the word \u201cCookies,\u201d thanks to the Girl Scout Cookie hype. But what makes Blue Cookies stand out from the many, many other Cookie crosses? The addition of Blueberry indica genetics, of course.\n#9.\u00a0Birthday Cake Kush\n\nAnother decadent GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) cross, Birthday Cake Kush also pulls in genetics from Cherry Pie to achieve a dessert-like taste that\u2019s not altogether unlike cake itself. It may not be your birthday, but the luxurious and relaxing qualities of this potent hybrid are certainly something to celebrate.\n#8.\u00a0Sour Tangie\n\nThe citrus-loaded sativa strain Tangie can\u2019t possibly be improved. Or can it? DNA Genetics has done it again, spinning their Tangie masterpiece with the help of East Coast Sour Diesel\u00a0genetics. Sour Tangie improves the fuel-like taste of Sour Diesel without compromising Sour D\u2019s high-flying creative effects, making this sativa a must-have for flavor enthusiasts and artists alike.\n#7.\u00a0Purple Candy\n\nPurple Candy blossomed in British Columbia, Canada. Believed to be a cross between BC Sweet Tooth and Mendocino Purps, it\u2019s\u00a0as sticky and sweet as grape hard candy. But you won\u2019t feel a sugar rush with this indica; instead, expect the heavy-hitter to prime you for bedtime or a solid nap.\n#6.\u00a0Quantum Kush\n\nA good sativa can lend a positive spark to an otherwise dreary day of chores, so it\u2019s no wonder that Quantum Kush tipped the charts in 2016 as one of the fastest\u00a0trending\u00a0sativa strains. While some sativas bring on the buzz with a bit too much gusto, resulting in anxiety and paranoia, Quantum Kush manages to deliver creative, talkative, giggly qualities without what we like to call \u201cThe Fear.\u201d\n#5.\u00a0God\u2019s Green Crack\n\nWho knew the not-so holy union of God Bud and Green Crack would result in something so heavenly? God Bud is known for producing mammoth yields of gargantuan buds, but the effects are a little heavy-handed for some. That\u2019s why Jordan of the Islands crossbred God Bud with Green Crack, the high-flying sativa strain that focuses all of its effort on elevating the mind to a place where laughing fits are inevitable.\n#4.\u00a0Gelato\n\nA new generation of GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) has arrived, and its name is Gelato. From the same breeders that delivered fan favorites Sunset Sherbet and GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), Cookie Fam Genetics from Bay Area, California isn\u2019t finished with their royal line quite yet. Gelato, a descendent of Sunset Sherbet and Thin Mint GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), blooms in bright colors that are almost as inviting as its tantalizing dessert-like aroma.\n#3.\u00a0Grape Stomper\n\nGrape Stomper isn\u2019t a new strain, but a jump in Leafly reviews will show that not all good things are sparkly and new. Strong genetics inherited from Purple Elephant and Chemdawg Sour Diesel equip this strain with the full package: flavor, potency, and consistency. Relaxing without encumbering social skills, the balanced Grape Stomper is an excellent choice for so many different activities. No wonder its popularity isn\u2019t waning.\n#2.\u00a0Nuken\n\nNuken is also an older strain making a comeback. Originally found in Canada, it\u2019s\u00a0since proliferated throughout the Pacific Northwest to states like Washington and Oregon. Herbal and sweet in flavor, Nuken cradles you in a blanket of dreamy euphoria where your thoughts can float upward to bliss.\n#1.\u00a0Superglue\n\nLast year, the top trending strain was GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4). This year it\u2019s Superglue, which surprisingly bears no family ties to last year\u2019s champ. A cross between Northern Lights and Afghani, Superglue develops a thick coat of sticky resin that will quite literally glue your fingers together. Though its parentage may lead you to believe Superglue will be a knockout, this strain is bred to deliver more light-footed effects. In fact, Leafly users have described this strain as focusing and creative while simultaneously relaxing the body.\n\nWhat was your favorite strain of 2016? We want to hear from you! Leave your most memorable cannabis varieties in the strain section below.",

            "text": "Method: Wolf-LX Vap\nGrind: Medium\nPulls: 4-7\nRating: 4.5/5.0\n\nWell, this was an impulse purchase. And i'm glad for it. Usually, my delivery service has a rounded selection of good kind. Its pretty consistent. And every so often, they carry some new stuff that I haven't come across to sample. Today was one of those days. And Super Glue was the mismatched sock that stood out. I mean the name sounds powerful. But I've been fooled by the name before. Pineapple Express comes to mind. And what a let down that high was... So, I conclude that knowledge is power. My next move is to look up thc%, to glance over previous reviews, and finally, I pull out my 8x photo loop and a nice l.e.d white light so I may observe the trichome characteristics. In general, I do notice a favoring trend between thc%, (subjective high), and \"degrees of frostiness\". Good bud has layered, highly visible, thick fields(large or small droplets, either) of crystals. \nI digress... Super Glue is a vibrant green to see. Really fresh and plump. It caught my eye immediately. Proud looking. I could feel myself looking forward to popping open the box lid, and sticking my nose in for a deep pull. Pungent, yes. A sharp sweet dirty earthiness to SG. Bright. Crisp. \nIn my vap it smoked a little better around 420 than it did at 390 or 400 respectively. I bet this would be tasty in a joint or a bong. Alas, no combust for me... anyways, why lament? Let's vap some Super Glue!!! I expected more resistance from the bud while being packed down the vap chamber opening. Typically, really sticky strains get hung up. Super Glue is not crazy sticky, but it does have weight to it. Resin weight too... as well as pull weight. Off a nicely packed chamber, I got some really plummy vapor rolls. And the taste... yummy sweet waxy petrol and pine and earth, as it rolls off the lips and just hangs on a bit, before leaping over into an ever-thinning-slice of Rocky Mountain atmosphere. I always get em' confused. Which one's body and which one is heady? Super Glue is a body heavy high for sure. Its fast acting. Warm and tingly straight away. Face is a flush with the nano scale hum of a trillion little points of electric fire... kinda thing. It feels like a heavy high to me. It could be just me, everything is heavy of late. But still... the high feels deep. Perhaps not a wake me up. It's the evening, and the day is behind me... perhaps that influences? A morning wake and bake ought be in order. Examine after a fresh sleep. I know, it sounds like I'm disapointed. Maybe... but maybe not the weeds fault. I've been consuming copious amounts of pot butter lately. If i were a cloud, I would be saturated in full, and raining... as it were, thc. And no! Not disapointed at all. I'm very aware of the high. Nothing subtle about it. I've been vaping White Widow all day or so... and that strain wasn't picking up at all. No matter how much I vaped. And O'l Super Glue here, sure right as rain, did change up the game a bit. Feels like it leaves the mind pretty much alone. My focus is still good. It's not an euphoric high, I'll say that. It is a mellowish high... but I don't mean weak!! Hard to explain kind of.. I guess I'm a little out of touch with what it is to be relaxed. Maybe that's it...?\nI think that this is one of the least helpful reviews I've written so far... lol.\nThe Super Glue... I love it!\n\nCheers,\nOccamsPhazer",
