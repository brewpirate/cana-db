Nothing extraordinary in color or frost. \nSmell: piney kush earthiness. What I would  expect from the parent strains. \nCrumble: good and fluffy. \nBurn: even and clean. \nTaste: on exhale you get the OG Kush dominance. Piney and fresh. \nHigh: all other things about this strain are average but the high is not. It is superb. This knocks you on your ass!  If you suffer from pain, migraines, cramps, or just life this strain will obliterate it. Don\u0027t reach for aspirin, toke some Supermax OG. \nOverall Experience: 9.3-10\nI rarely give 5 stars but this strain\u0027s potency demands it. It is my go to medicine when I\u0027m sore or stressed.
