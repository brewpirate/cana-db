            "text": "Sweet Dreams is a better night-time smoke than even some pure indicas, but don't let that put you off enjoying this gentle hybrid in the early evening. To me, Sweet Dreams has a really unique feel, and is perfect for anxiety alleviation or just relaxing during the day. It's not an intense relaxation- it doesn't give your sense of self an experiential Turkish bath like some strains do. It's mellow, floaty, and gentle- and one of the only strains I can smoke directly before bed, which is so so beautiful. ",

            "text": "This 1000 mL oil tank from PTS, is the only current indica offering in the 1000 mL tank product line. The flavor is very heavy pine with a myr/sage finish. The terpenes are very strong and the flavor was off-putting for me. The first few puffs felt like pine cleaning fluid. The effect was moderate relaxation, pain relief, and clearing of invasive thoughts. This was also the only tank from PTS that I tried which clogged up during use. Overall I think that this product was decent, but needs some revisions for the amount of terpenes added back to the oil. At $70, it was still a very reasonable amount to try something new and different. I can admit that maybe I would like this strain more if I enjoyed the flavor.",
