Overall I think that this product was decent, but needs some revisions for the amount of terpenes added back to the oil. At $70, it was still a very reasonable amount to try something new and different. I can admit that maybe I would like this strain more if I enjoyed the flavor.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":35,"flavors":[{"name":"Pungent","score":111.35135135135135},{"name":"Pine","score":111.35135135135135},{"name":"Sage","score":100.67567567567568},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":100},{"name":"Earthy","score":22.7027027027027}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":145.13513513513513},{"name":"Sleepy","score":140.13513513513513},{"name":"Hungry","score":15.405405405405405},{"name":"Happy","score":14.72972972972973},{"name":"Euphoric","score":12.027027027027028}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":130.40540540540542},{"name":"Depression","score":123.37837837837837},{"name":"Insomnia","score":114.72972972972973},{"name":"Seizures","score":110},{"name":"Pain","score":28.378378378378379}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":122.70270270270271},{"name":"PTSD","score":111.35135135135135},{"name":"Arthritis","score":110.67567567567568},{"name":"Epilepsy","score":15},{"name":"Migraines","score":11.351351351351351}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":14.72972972972973},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":14.72972972972973},{"name":"Headache","score":5},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.67567567567567566},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.67567567567567566}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sweet-dreams_100x100_2b03.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522073/b/sweet-dreams__primary_f5cd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sweet-dreams_100x100_d67b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/517515/b/sweet-dreams__primary_01b1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sweet-dreams_100x100_b9a3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/499577/b/sweet-dreams__primary_abe6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sweet-dreams_100x100_90cf.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/489008/b/sweet-dreams__primary_08e5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sweet-dreams_100x100_b291.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/473771/b/sweet-dreams__primary_c4bc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sweet-dreams_100x100_65e4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/472212/b/sweet-dreams__primary_ba37.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":8,"popularCities":["Chicago, IL","Everett, WA","Seattle, WA","Addison, IL","Colorado Springs, CO","Des Moines, WA","Effingham, IL","El Mirage, AZ","Elmwood Park, IL","Eugene, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.28571428571429/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
