            "text": "Strain: Sweet Kush (Sweet Tooth / OG Kush cross -- this one was a Sativa leaning Hybrid)\nTHC: 21.67%\nCBD: 0.23\nGrower: LTRMN\nLocation found: KaLeafa\nDate purchased: 3.29.16 \nPrice: $8.00/g\nWeight: 1.1g\nMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \nSmell: When the scissors cut through the bud I smelled a sweet, damp earthy, lemony zest. It reminds me of the hard to place tastes and smells of the Afghani and Nepalese landraces. The taste of damp, untouched earth attached to the bottom of a long lost rock atop a mountain with extremely thin air. \nLook: Greenhouse bud that is darker green to orange hues. Orange hairs, pretty dense and not especially coated in kif. Machine trimmed? \nTaste: Lemony OG in the beginning with the damp mountain rock flavor at the end with a lingering something I am not sure is besides earthy. It was an extremely smooth smoking bud for compared to the look (which was not horrible, just not indoor craziness I have seen).\nRecommendation for medicine: This particular variety of this strain was very uplifting to me. The typical Kush overrun feeling with most with OG crossed within was not present here. It reminded me of the properties from the Afghani strain I have sampled. It is a cluttered mess of effects and I do agree with the idea of being careful with this strain. It is not a straightforward ride to say the least. It is good for some pain relief and creativity for me. A good introduction to the landraces collected from around the globe.",

It has an amazing smell and a great high, relaxes your whole body but doesn\u2019t make you tired, really euphoric. I have major depressive disorder and after smoking this I was really talkative and couldn\u2019t stop laughing at first. All in all it\u2019s a great strain and I definitely recommend it.",
