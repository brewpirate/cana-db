The high went from nothing to uncomfortable racing heart and mild paranoia in a split second, leaving me no time to adjust dosage before I crossed the point of no return. For a hybrid that's known to be relaxing and uplifting, that's immensely disappointing. \nI will say it smoked smoothly and I don't have the munchies (mostly because my mouth tastes like a cigar bar caught on fire and burned to the ground on my tongue), but that hardly seems worth the $310/ounce when there are far superior, more mellow meds available for ~2/3 that price. As it is I'm now sitting here, feeling incredibly uncomfortable, and relying on all my expertise as a seasoned smoker of over a decade to talk myself down and keep from having a panic attack. If it's doing anything for my pain, I can't tell you. I'm far too focused on not jumping out of my skin.",
