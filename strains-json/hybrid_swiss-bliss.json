    "description": "<p>Swiss Bliss has a rather infamous history. Plants from this strain are all descended from a Swiss sativa plant that was seized by the gendarme and eventually given asylum in Holland at Paradise Seeds. The plant was hybridized with other strains to create the mostly sativa hybrid that is known as Swiss Bliss. These plants are hardy growers but do best indoors and flower at 9 weeks. Space may be a concern as they are known for their abundant branching, but when given the space, they can produce very high yields. Flowers usually show an abundance of frosty crystals and the aroma of sour fruit.</p>",

            "text": "This was one of the first very memorable strains that I remember getting in college.  I just remember that you could stick it to the wall and it would stay put, for a couple seconds at least.  The buds were always well manicured, fragrant, and bristling with white crystals.  The high was very mellow and, well, blissful!  I can't think of a better way to describe the feeling that this gave you.  It was a very dreamy, soupy sort of head-swimming bliss.  You were let down quite gently when it wore off and left wanting more.  Everyday stressors and cares were easily washed away with several tokes and you were left to simply enjoy the world around you.  This strain was also perfect for enjoy Christmas lights strung up at night; smoke on!",
