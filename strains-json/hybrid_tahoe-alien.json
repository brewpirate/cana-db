It\u0027s buds have a very resin like feel to them, sticky icky to the max. I have been vaping this strain for a couple months and I find that is a great evening strain. Whenever it is vaped through my PAX I feel totally couch locked. The pain relief I get from this strain is very comparable to that of high CBD and pure indica \u0026 sativa strains. A draw back of this is that it makes my eyes and mouth quite dry. The tastes I get are earth, pine, a hint of lemon. The lemon was almost not present in this particular flower, but it is some potent buds. I recommend this strain to any athlete at the end of the day or post workout. It is also good for hanging about on the couch or a prior to a good nights rest.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/rfCAo_Cv5-R2VdW_OzF7GFZLWzo=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net%2fLX75xmNmc1EAEx3zx9mm_NI_xtg%3d%2f120x120%2fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3.amazonaws.com%252Fleafly%252Fbin%252F81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":46,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":81.75595238095238},{"name":"Lemon","score":80.50595238095238},{"name":"Citrus","score":55.50595238095238},{"name":"Pine","score":31.13095238095238},{"name":"Flowery","score":25.625}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":102.41071428571428},{"name":"Euphoric","score":91.398809523809518},{"name":"Happy","score":70.148809523809518},{"name":"Energetic","score":61.398809523809526},{"name":"Hungry","score":41.398809523809526}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":40.654761904761905},{"name":"Stress","score":40.148809523809526},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":37.023809523809526},{"name":"Nausea","score":34.642857142857139},{"name":"Insomnia","score":34.136904761904759}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":13.273809523809524},{"name":"PTSD","score":10.892857142857142},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":6.0119047619047619},{"name":"PMS","score":4.2559523809523814},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.2559523809523814}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":31.011904761904763},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":27.38095238095238},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.3809523809523809}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/tahoe-alien_100x100_1905.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001213/b/tahoe-alien__primary_4e5e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/tahoe-alien_100x100_5b2a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/613743/b/tahoe-alien__primary_ec20.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/tahoe-alien_100x100_c347.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522291/b/tahoe-alien__primary_0aa3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/tahoe-alien_100x100_7f66.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/521163/b/tahoe-alien__primary_16eb.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/tahoe-alien_100x100_44d8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/504225/b/tahoe-alien__primary_f557.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/tahoe-alien_100x100_49e9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494810/b/tahoe-alien__primary_44f8.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":12,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Trinidad, CO","Colorado Springs, CO","Denver, CO","Glenwood Springs, CO","Las Vegas, NV","Portland, OR","Rifle, CO","Aberdeen, WA","Airway Heights, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.47826086956522/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Tahoe OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"tahoe-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-og","symbol":"Tok","applink":"leafly://strain/tahoe-og"},{"name":"Alien Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"alien-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/alien-kush","symbol":"Alk","applink":"leafly://strain/alien-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":"Indoor","growNotes":"\n\tSlowly introduce a moderate amount of nutrients\n\n"}}
