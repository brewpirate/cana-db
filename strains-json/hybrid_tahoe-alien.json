I have been vaping this strain for a couple months and I find that is a great evening strain. Whenever it is vaped through my PAX I feel totally couch locked. The pain relief I get from this strain is very comparable to that of high CBD and pure indica & sativa strains. A draw back of this is that it makes my eyes and mouth quite dry. The tastes I get are earth, pine, a hint of lemon. The lemon was almost not present in this particular flower, but it is some potent buds. I recommend this strain to any athlete at the end of the day or post workout. It is also good for hanging about on the couch or a prior to a good nights rest.",
