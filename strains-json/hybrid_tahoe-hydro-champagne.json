            "text": "This strain is very unique. Upon exhaling the first hit, you are left with a taste of sour earth, with a touch of floral and pine. The smell has similar traits, but has a sharp hint of cheese also. A good weekend strain; the energy that is given from this sativa hybrid is not too dominant but enough to get you up and moving. It is a fun, euphoric buzz that gets you talkative and engaging. Perfect for a social setting or winding down at home. In larger amounts, the strain has a relaxing side that, hand in hand with the sativa traits, is a perfect combination. There is mild pain and tension relief after the effect sets in, and mood is greatly enhanced. An experience to try this strain. Only downsides would be very dry mouth and no real appetite stimulation.",

            "text": "This was a surprising turn from your everyday sativa. Starting off with a sweet and mellow flavor with a tart, almost tangy aftertone, Champagne hits with a rush of tingles at the fingertips before it begins to even out with a relaxed body and a chatty, energetic head. Perfect for an afternoon out or an evening in. Great for the active user.",
