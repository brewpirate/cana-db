            "text": "Great strain, definitely a very sweet citrusy flavor out of glass as well as wrapped in a blunt. The high is quite laid back, an excellent choice for studying as the effects aren't so much cerebral as uplifting and focusing. Also really a great option for video games and chilling, I like to play video games and I like to get stoned but so many strains don't work like that for me, I get too spacey. Tangelo is the holy grail in my opinion for feeling the relaxing effects of cannabis without making you too dumb. A word of caution though it has a wicked couch lock/body relaxation effect if you smoke more than you usually would in a session ",
