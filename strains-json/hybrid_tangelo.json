The high is quite laid back, an excellent choice for studying as the effects aren\u0027t so much cerebral as uplifting and focusing. Also really a great option for video games and chilling, I like to play video games and I like to get stoned but so many strains don\u0027t work like that for me, I get too spacey. Tangelo is the holy grail in my opinion for feeling the relaxing effects of cannabis without making you too dumb. A word of caution though it has a wicked couch lock/body relaxation effect if you smoke more than you usually would in a session ","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"},{"id":1621386,"username":"ToastedPineapple80","text":"Kept focused, and laid back at the same time.
