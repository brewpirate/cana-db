And we’re guessing your party planning is already in full swing. Traditionally, the most important element of the evening has been the sparkling wine for a midnight toast. Bringing cannabis into the mix this year is the perfect way to celebrate everything the legalization movement has achieved in 2016, and the delectable pairing virtually guarantees a feel-good start to 2017.\nHow to go about pairing bud with your bubbly? As with any wine pairing, you’ll want to be aware of how the cannabis’s tasting notes will complement those of your sparkling wine. You’ll also want to take into account the effects of the strain you choose — steer clear of anything that might cause you to nod off before midnight!\nWhile everyone’s preferences will vary slightly, read on for four pairing ideas to end the year on a high note.\n \nIf you’re drinking cava…\n\nWine to try: Can Macià Bohigas Cava Brut Penedes ($15, K\u0026L Wine Merchants)\n \nStrain to try: Outer Space\nA style of sparkling wine that has made great gains in popularity of late, cava is Spain’s signature sparkler. This particular iteration from Can Macià reveals crisp apple and sweet pear notes upon popping the cork. For a full range of holiday fruit flavors, pair with a cherry- and berry-flavored sativa like Outer Space. Its cheery, chatty aftereffects are an excellent added bonus.\n \nIf you’re drinking sparkling rosé…\n\nWine to try: Argyle Winery 2012 Brut Rosé ($50, Argyle Winery)\n \nStrain to try: Tangerine Dream\nLooking to sip outside the box this year? Switch out the classic golden bubbles for something a little pinker: sparkling rosé. This particular bottling is a bit spendy at $50, but Argyle’s Brut Rosé has also been served at White House dinners by two different presidential administrations, so you know it’s worth the splurge. Pair it with an equally highly regarded hybrid like the appetizing, award-winning Tangerine Dream.\n \nIf you’re drinking brut…\n\nWine to try: NV Mumm Napa Brut Prestige ($18, BevMo!)\n \nStrain to try: Cactus\nOn the dry end of the sparkling wine spectrum, a brut classification indicates that your bottle of sparkling wine contains hardly any residual sugar. This lets the grapes’ naturally occurring flavor notes shine through. Pair with a relaxed yet chatty indica like Cactus; if big parties aren’t always your cup of tea, an anxiety-quelling strain like this one is a great way to go.\n \nIf you’re drinking demi-sec…\n\nWine to try: Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec ($31, Total Wine)\n \nStrain to try: Laughing Buddha\nToward the other end of sparkling wine’s sweetness spectrum lie demi-sec Champagnes, which maintain more residual sugar than their drier brut cousins. To offset this sweetness, match a demi-sec wine with the herbal, earthy aromas and giggly, feel-good effects of a sativa like Laughing Buddha. What better way to go into the new year than with a smile on your face?\n\n\nImage Sources: Argyle Winery, Total Wine, Bevmo!, KL Wines, Michael Mina Wine Club","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/29200422/bud-bubbly-pairing-your-new-years-champagne-with-cannabis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/bud-bubbly-pairing-your-new-years-champagne-with-cannabis"},{"id":"contentitems-3501","title":"The Leafly Strain Reviews Hall of Fame: Your Review Could Win You Some Leafly Gear!","author":"Lisa Rough","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1423249200000)\/","text":"Welcome to a new year and a new Strain Reviews Hall of Fame!\nAnd now for something completely different…..For all you poets, dreamers, and hilarious reviewers, you are in for a treat!
