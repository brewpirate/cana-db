Traditionally, the most important element of the evening has been the sparkling wine for a midnight toast. Bringing cannabis into the mix this year is the perfect way to celebrate everything the legalization movement has achieved in 2016, and the delectable pairing virtually guarantees a feel-good start to 2017.\nHow to go about pairing bud with your bubbly? As with any wine pairing, you\u2019ll want to be aware of how the cannabis\u2019s tasting notes will complement those of your sparkling wine. You\u2019ll also want to take into account the effects of the strain you choose \u2014 steer clear of anything that might cause you to nod off before midnight!\nWhile everyone\u2019s preferences will vary slightly, read on for four\u00a0pairing ideas to end the year on a high note.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re drinking cava\u2026\n\nWine to try: Can Maci\u00e0 Bohigas Cava Brut Penedes ($15, K&L Wine Merchants)\n\u00a0\nStrain to try: Outer Space\nA\u00a0style of sparkling wine that has made great gains in popularity of late, cava is Spain\u2019s signature sparkler. This particular iteration from Can Maci\u00e0 reveals crisp apple and sweet pear notes upon popping the cork. For a full range of holiday fruit flavors, pair with a cherry- and berry-flavored sativa like Outer Space. Its cheery, chatty aftereffects are an excellent added bonus.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re drinking sparkling ros\u00e9\u2026\n\nWine to try: Argyle Winery 2012 Brut Ros\u00e9 ($50, Argyle Winery)\n\u00a0\nStrain to try: Tangerine Dream\nLooking to sip outside the box this year? Switch out the classic golden bubbles for something a little pinker: sparkling ros\u00e9. This particular bottling is a bit spendy at $50, but Argyle\u2019s Brut Ros\u00e9 has also been served at White House dinners by two different presidential administrations, so you know it\u2019s worth the splurge. Pair it with an equally highly regarded hybrid like the appetizing, award-winning Tangerine Dream.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re drinking brut\u2026\n\nWine to try: NV Mumm Napa Brut Prestige ($18, BevMo!)\n\u00a0\nStrain to try: Cactus\nOn the dry end of the sparkling wine spectrum, a brut classification indicates that your bottle of sparkling wine contains hardly any residual sugar. This lets the grapes\u2019 naturally occurring flavor notes shine through. Pair with a relaxed yet chatty indica like Cactus; if big parties aren\u2019t always your cup of tea, an anxiety-quelling strain like this one is a great way to go.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re drinking demi-sec\u2026\n\nWine to try: Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec ($31, Total Wine)\n\u00a0\nStrain to try: Laughing Buddha\nToward the other end of sparkling wine\u2019s sweetness spectrum lie demi-sec Champagnes, which maintain more residual sugar than their drier brut cousins. To offset this sweetness, match a demi-sec wine with the herbal, earthy aromas and giggly, feel-good effects of a sativa like Laughing Buddha. What better way to go into the new year than with a smile on your face?\n\n\nImage Sources: Argyle Winery, Total Wine, Bevmo!, KL Wines, Michael Mina Wine Club",

            "text": "Leafly's strain database was just updated with some new varieties. Have you had a chance to check out Snoop Dogg's newest line of cannabis strains? Read about those and more below. Also, remember to submit a review if you've tried any of these newly added strains!\n\u00a0\n 1. Orange Creamsicle\n\nTaking the best attributes of parent strains Orange Crush and Juicy Fruit, Orange Creamsicle\u2019s tall structure, heavy colas, and pungent flavor will be sure to keep you coming back for more. This hybrid strain, as the name suggests, has a strong citrus flavor and is used to treat nausea and anxiety. Growers will be happy with this heavy producer that flowers in 9 weeks with beautiful orange-white coloring and a thick coating of resin.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Orange Creamsicle\n\u00a0\n 2. 3D CBD\n\n3D CBD from Snoop Dogg\u2019s branded line of cannabis strains was crafted with patients in mind. With a THC:CBD ratio of about 5:8, this earthy-flavored sativa is preferred for treating pain, inflammation, and muscle tension. Consumers susceptible to THC-induced anxiety may also appreciate the sobering, relaxing balance CBD has to offer.\n\n3D CBD is currently available at LivWell on Broadway in Denver, CO\n\u00a0\n 3. Purple Bush\n\nPurple Bush, brought to you by Leafs by Snoop, is an indica-dominant hybrid that carries all the hallmark traits of a kush with a hint of berry flavor. This dense purple-hued strain tests upward of 21% THC and will have you feeling relaxed after a long day.\n\nPurple Bush is currently available at LivWell on Broadway in Denver, CO\n\u00a0\n 4. Bluniverse\n\nBluniverse, also called Blue Universe, is a 50/50 hybrid strain bred by Dynasty Seeds. Mothered by Blue Magoo and fathered by Ms. Universe, Bluniverse inherits a complex flavor profile of blueberry, cherry, and vanilla spice. Its initial effects focus themselves cerebrally, with high-flying euphoria that tapers into pacifying relaxation over time. This hybrid may express one of three different phenotypes, one that takes after Blue Magoo, another taking after Ms. Universe, and a third that exhibits a balance of each parent\u2019s characteristics.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Bluniverse\n\u00a0\n 5. Tangerine Man\n\nFrom Leafs by Snoop comes Tangerine Man, a sativa-dominant hybrid that is perhaps the best of his new strains. With a citrus aroma and trichome-coated buds, expect a nice pick-me-up that pairs wonderfully with daytime physical activity.\n\nTangerine Man is currently available at LivWell on Broadway in Denver, CO\n\u00a0\n 6. Gooberry\n\nGooberry is an indica-dominant strain descended from legendary parents Afgoo and Blueberry. This fruity, spicy strain will leave you giggling on your couch with upward of 20% THC. Consumers highly recommend this strain for night time use to treat pain and insomnia, and it's sure to leave you with the munchies. Like most indicas, Gooberry will flower in 7-9 weeks with a short, bushy structure.\n\nGooberry is currently available at Orange County Cannabis Club in Santa Ana, CA\n\u00a0\n 7. ICED Grapefruit\n\nICED Grapefruit by Female Seeds is a hybrid strain that brings together genetics from ICE and Grapefruit. The resulting hybrid leans slightly to the sativa side, offering uplifting and happy effects that keep positivity flowing. The physically relaxing qualities of this strain come from its ICE parent, an indica-dominant hybrid cherished for its sedating effects. Both parents come through in the flavor as hashy notes intermix with sweet citrus and fruit.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying ICED Grapefruit\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",
