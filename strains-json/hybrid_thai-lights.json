With the weekend coming up, it may be time to stock up on some new strains and we\u0027ve highlighted a few possibilities below. These five newest additions to the Leafly Explorer were nominated by our app users, and you can check their availability near you by visiting their strain detail pages. If you\u0027re one of the lucky few able to locate and try one of these new strains, be sure to share your thoughts and opinions in a review.\nHappy strain hunting!\n   1. Tiger\u0027s Milk\nCharacteristics of Tiger\u0027s Milk:\n\nTiger’s Milk by Bodhi Seeds is a powerful indica-dominant strain that descends from Bubba Kush and Appalachia. Initially, Tiger’s Milk hits with intense cerebral euphoria, an experience described by its breeders as being borderline psychedelic. Tapering down to restful relaxation over time, this indica is commonly looked to for its pain-relieving and sleepy qualities. Its aroma is a complex mix of earthy notes, led by hints of sweet honey and hashy spice.\n\n 2. Thai Lights\nCharacteristics of Thai Lights:\n\nThai Lights is a sativa-dominant blend that crosses the uplifting effects of Thai Haze with the stable and robust Northern Lights. Originally bred by Dr. Atomic, Thai lights is a dynamic hybrid that boasts sweet earthy flavors and a cerebral buzz that accommodates social outings with an energetic rush of happiness. Medical patients applaud Thai Lights’ ability to combat depression and minimize the debilitating effects of migraine headaches.\n\n 3. Incredible Bulk\nCharacteristics of Incredible Bulk:\n\nIncredible Bulk is a mixture of three notable indicas. Big Bud combines with Super Skunk and Green Spirit to create the sweet earthy flavors of hash that usher in Incredible Bulk’s relaxing effects. Its sedating effects make Incredible Bulk a great choice to help you unwind at the end of the day. Originally bred by Dr. Krippling for its heavy yields and ease of growth, Incredible Bulk is a very stable plant that makes a compelling case for indoor cultivation. The buds are known to explode in size when grown hydroponically.\n\n 4. Ultra Sonja\nCharacteristics of Ultra Sonja:\n\nUltra Sonja is a sativa-dominant descendant of U.K. Cheese and Tang Tang that inherits an unusual blend of flavor and effects from its parent strains. Like a pairing of wine and cheese, Ultra Sonja combines a sour funky aroma with deep fruity accents in a display of its heritage. Its dense buds, which sometimes express themselves in tones of purple, deliver clear-headed feelings of bliss and tranquility. \n\n 5. Jack Diesel\nCharacteristics of Jack Diesel:\n\nJack Diesel crosses two mainstays in the cannabis world, Jack Herer and NYC Diesel, to produce a pungent mix of floral and diesel aromas. Its woody flavors are intertwined with sweet hints of fruit that bring on potent, long-lasting sativa effects. The uplifting sativa buzz is reminiscent of Haze varieties, generating immediate relaxation followed by an energetic rush that stimulates creativity along with your appetite.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12002445/new-strains-alert-tigers-milk-thai-lights-incredible-bulk-ultra-s.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-tigers-milk-thai-lights-incredible-bulk-ultra-s"}],"reviewCount":35,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":51.470588235294116},{"name":"Flowery","score":50.735294117647058},{"name":"Vanilla","score":50},{"name":"Chemical","score":50},{"name":"Earthy","score":16.176470588235293}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":131.61764705882354},{"name":"Relaxed","score":123.89705882352941},{"name":"Uplifted","score":82.3529411764706},{"name":"Euphoric","score":72.42647058823529},{"name":"Giggly","score":71.691176470588232}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":101.47058823529412},{"name":"Pain","score":101.47058823529412},{"name":"Depression","score":71.691176470588232},{"name":"Stress","score":71.691176470588232},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":65.441176470588232}],"conditions":[{"name":"PTSD","score":107.72058823529412},{"name":"Arthritis","score":50},{"name":"Anxiety","score":7.7205882352941178},{"name":"Migraines","score":6.9852941176470589},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":6.9852941176470589}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":14.705882352941178},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":12.5},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.4705882352941175}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/thai-lights_100x100_031d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/519054/b/thai-lights__primary_7a10.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/thai-lights_100x100_93cf.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/407725/b/thai-lights__primary_938d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/thai-lights_100x100_4e39.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/367640/b/thai-lights__primary_456f.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":3,"popularCities":["Chicago, IL","Addison, IL","Collinsville, IL","Joliet, IL","Litchfield, IL","Lynden, WA","Mokena, IL","Morris, IL","Mount Prospect, IL","Mundelein, IL"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-lights","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.71428571428571/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Northern Lights","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights","symbol":"Nl","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights"},{"name":"Thai","subtitle":null,"slug":"thai","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/thai","symbol":"Tha","applink":"leafly://strain/thai"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":70,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":"Low","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\t9-11 weeks flowering time\n\n"}}

However, while it kinda messed with my stomach it did wonders for relaxing my sore legs and knees (I have arthritis) so this effect makes this a great option for me to pick up again in the future.

With the weekend coming up, it may be time to stock up on some new strains and we\u0027ve highlighted a few possibilities below. These five newest additions to the Leafly Explorer were nominated by our app users, and you can check their availability near you by visiting their strain detail pages. If you\u0027re one of the lucky few able to locate and try one of these new strains, be sure to share your thoughts and opinions in a review.\nHappy strain hunting!\n   1. Tiger\u0027s Milk\nCharacteristics of Tiger\u0027s Milk:\n\nTiger’s Milk by Bodhi Seeds is a powerful indica-dominant strain that descends from Bubba Kush and Appalachia. Initially, Tiger’s Milk hits with intense cerebral euphoria, an experience described by its breeders as being borderline psychedelic. Tapering down to restful relaxation over time, this indica is commonly looked to for its pain-relieving and sleepy qualities. Its aroma is a complex mix of earthy notes, led by hints of sweet honey and hashy spice.\n\n 2. Thai Lights\nCharacteristics of Thai Lights:\n\nThai Lights is a sativa-dominant blend that crosses the uplifting effects of Thai Haze with the stable and robust Northern Lights. Originally bred by Dr. Atomic, Thai lights is a dynamic hybrid that boasts sweet earthy flavors and a cerebral buzz that accommodates social outings with an energetic rush of happiness. Medical patients applaud Thai Lights’ ability to combat depression and minimize the debilitating effects of migraine headaches.\n\n 3. Incredible Bulk\nCharacteristics of Incredible Bulk:\n\nIncredible Bulk is a mixture of three notable indicas. Big Bud combines with Super Skunk and Green Spirit to create the sweet earthy flavors of hash that usher in Incredible Bulk’s relaxing effects. Its sedating effects make Incredible Bulk a great choice to help you unwind at the end of the day. Originally bred by Dr. Krippling for its heavy yields and ease of growth, Incredible Bulk is a very stable plant that makes a compelling case for indoor cultivation. The buds are known to explode in size when grown hydroponically.\n\n 4. Ultra Sonja\nCharacteristics of Ultra Sonja:\n\nUltra Sonja is a sativa-dominant descendant of U.K. Cheese and Tang Tang that inherits an unusual blend of flavor and effects from its parent strains. Like a pairing of wine and cheese, Ultra Sonja combines a sour funky aroma with deep fruity accents in a display of its heritage. Its dense buds, which sometimes express themselves in tones of purple, deliver clear-headed feelings of bliss and tranquility. \n\n 5. Jack Diesel\nCharacteristics of Jack Diesel:\n\nJack Diesel crosses two mainstays in the cannabis world, Jack Herer and NYC Diesel, to produce a pungent mix of floral and diesel aromas. Its woody flavors are intertwined with sweet hints of fruit that bring on potent, long-lasting sativa effects. The uplifting sativa buzz is reminiscent of Haze varieties, generating immediate relaxation followed by an energetic rush that stimulates creativity along with your appetite.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12002445/new-strains-alert-tigers-milk-thai-lights-incredible-bulk-ultra-s.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-tigers-milk-thai-lights-incredible-bulk-ultra-s"}],"reviewCount":35,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":51.470588235294116},{"name":"Flowery","score":50.735294117647058},{"name":"Vanilla","score":50},{"name":"Chemical","score":50},{"name":"Earthy","score":16.176470588235293}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":131.61764705882354},{"name":"Relaxed","score":123.89705882352941},{"name":"Uplifted","score":82.3529411764706},{"name":"Euphoric","score":72.42647058823529},{"name":"Giggly","score":71.691176470588232}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":101.47058823529412},{"name":"Pain","score":101.47058823529412},{"name":"Depression","score":71.691176470588232},{"name":"Stress","score":71.691176470588232},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":65.441176470588232}],"conditions":[{"name":"PTSD","score":107.72058823529412},{"name":"Arthritis","score":50},{"name":"Anxiety","score":7.7205882352941178},{"name":"Migraines","score":6.9852941176470589},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":6.9852941176470589}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":14.705882352941178},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":12.5},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.4705882352941175}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/thai-lights_100x100_031d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/519054/b/thai-lights__primary_7a10.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/thai-lights_100x100_93cf.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/407725/b/thai-lights__primary_938d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/thai-lights_100x100_4e39.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/367640/b/thai-lights__primary_456f.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":3,"popularCities":["Chicago, IL","Addison, IL","Collinsville, IL","Joliet, IL","Litchfield, IL","Lynden, WA","Mokena, IL","Morris, IL","Mount Prospect, IL","Mundelein, IL"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-lights","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.71428571428571/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Northern Lights","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights","symbol":"Nl","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights"},{"name":"Thai","subtitle":null,"slug":"thai","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/thai","symbol":"Tha","applink":"leafly://strain/thai"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":70,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":"Low","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\t9-11 weeks flowering time\n\n"}}
