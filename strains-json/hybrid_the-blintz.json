            "text": "Come on feels exactly like that giddy thrill in your gut when going to amusement parks. Exciting encouragement provides tons of energy and euphoric motivation. This is the strain for getting shit done and feeling as good as you possibly could while doing it! Dizzying degrees of uplifting euphoria that stones you out a uniquely moderate amount - like when you first get tipsy while drinking and are feeling great but aren\u2019t totally there. Physically feel not just functional, but cooly improved. Music registers very emotionally and if you focus on it, it can almost get overwhelming. What\u2019s surprising is how easily it lets you move distractions to the back of your mind and focus on what\u2019s at hand. While typing this, I didn\u2019t think music was as good - until I gave it my attention and then it was almost too much. It is worth mentioning a streak of vicodin/pain medicine-like cozy numbing that feels good, but reduces 30% of the impact from music, movies, etc. Lovely wake and bake with atmospheric music.",
