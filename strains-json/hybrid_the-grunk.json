If your experiences with any of these strains were as unforgettable as their names, leave some reviews telling us about them!\nThree of these strains come from our friends at Oregrown in Bend, OR, but be sure to check the \"Availability\" tab on the strain pages to find out if any of these are being offered at a location near you.\n \n   1. The Grunk\n\nThe Grunk is a perfect representation of its parent strains Grape Ape and Skunk #1. The aroma is sweet and fruity, mixing with pungent skunky notes to create a flavorful burst of earthy, grape flavors upon exhale. The relaxing indica-dominant effects calm body pains and are balanced by a clear-headed cerebral buzz that lifts away anxieties.\n\n \n   2. MILF\n\nMILF, also known as MILF Weed, from Mother Chucker’s Seeds takes its name from an acronym for Marijuana I’d Like to Flower. This sativa-heavy hybrid crosses White Widow with a select cut of Trainwreck from Arcata, California (e-32). While there is a known indica-dominant phenotype floating around, the MILF strain tends to be led by a strong heady buzz that elevates your mood.\n\n \n   3. Oregon Diesel\n\nOregon Diesel is an indica-dominant hybrid that combines NYC Diesel and Blackberry genetics in a blend bred by Homegrown Natural Wonders specifically for the Pacific Northwest climate. This strain was popularized by Oregrown as they hunted for quality genetics. Oregon Diesel is recommended for nighttime pain relief and its relaxing yet clear-headed effects will calm stress and help you avoid sleepless nights.\n\nAvailable at Oregrown in Bend, OR\n \n   4. The One\n\nThe One, originally bred by Clackamas Coots or CC, is a perfectly balanced hybrid of two landrace strains. It is sometimes referred to by its genetic combination Thai x Pure Afghan, with its sativa heritage stemming from its Thai background and the Afghan influence bringing a thick resinous frosting of trichomes. This specific combination of two cornerstone landrace strains is known to only be available through a select circle of breeders and growers in Oregon.\n\nAvailable at Oregrown in Bend, OR\n \n   5. Sourlope\n\nSourlope is a sativa-dominant cross known for its uplifting and energetic effects. Believed to be a hybrid of NYC Diesel and Cannalope Haze genetics, Sourlope creates a mix of tropical flavors that are sharpened by a strong diesel note. The elevated mood and creative head space attributed to this strain make it a great choice for daytime use and when combating stress and fatigue.\n\n \n   6. Funfetti\n\nFunfetti is a 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid that crosses Cherry Pie with a select phenotype of Animal Cookies, nicknamed Secret Cookies. This strain was originally bred in Northern California by a group of breeders know as Bay Exclusives and was released in limited quantities. Funfetti expresses itself in dark shades of purple and blue that contrast the bright orange pistils and milky trichomes covering all available surface area of the bud. It carries a piney OG undertone to go along with its sweet creamy flavor that is reminiscent of fresh baked birthday cake.\n\nAvailable at Oregrown in Bend, OR\n \n   7. Holy Ghost\n\nHoly Ghost is a harmony of attractive genetics that balance the relaxing nature of indicas with sativas’ cerebral activity. Parent strains Satori, Amnesia Haze, Pitbull, and Durban Poison combine to create a pungent blend of diesel and citrus aromas that are enhanced by an earthy exhale of spiced sandalwood. The interplay of sativa and indica genetics relax the body without putting you to sleep, and energize the mind without overstimulation. Holy Ghost is an enjoyable answer when faced with stress or depression.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/12002440/new-strains-alert-the-grunk-milf-holy-ghost-sourlope-and-more.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-the-grunk-milf-holy-ghost-sourlope-and-more"}],"reviewCount":42,"flavors":[{"name":"Grape","score":9.75609756097561},{"name":"Skunk","score":6.0975609756097562},{"name":"Sweet","score":4.8780487804878048},{"name":"Pungent","score":4.8780487804878048},{"name":"Earthy","score":3.6585365853658534}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":20.528455284552845},{"name":"Happy","score":20.528455284552845},{"name":"Creative","score":12.601626016260163},{"name":"Energetic","score":12.601626016260163},{"name":"Uplifted","score":9.75609756097561}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":3.6585365853658534},{"name":"Pain","score":3.6585365853658534},{"name":"Depression","score":3.0487804878048781},{"name":"Headaches","score":2.4390243902439024},{"name":"Insomnia","score":2.4390243902439024}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":3.0487804878048781},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":1.8292682926829267},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.2195121951219512},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.2195121951219512},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":1.2195121951219512}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":11.991869918699186},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.0487804878048781},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.2195121951219512},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.2195121951219512},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.6097560975609756}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/the-grunk_100x100_c075.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/463483/b/the-grunk__primary_830b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/the-grunk_100x100_eb0e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/384525/b/the-grunk__primary_6aad.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/the-grunk_100x100_7419.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/361741/b/the-grunk__primary_82b3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/the-grunk_100x100_befb.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/337745/b/the-grunk__primary_25a7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/the-grunk_100x100_18a1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/338029/b/the-grunk__primary_e7ad.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":5,"popularCities":["Spokane, WA","Everett, WA","Olympia, WA","Seattle, WA","Bellevue, WA","Bellingham, WA","Gold Bar, WA","Granite Falls, WA","Longview, WA","Lynnwood, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.57142857142857/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Grape Ape","subtitle":null,"slug":"grape-ape","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/grape-ape","symbol":"Ga","applink":"leafly://strain/grape-ape"},{"name":"Skunk #1","subtitle":null,"slug":"skunk-1","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1","symbol":"Sk1","applink":"leafly://strain/skunk-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
