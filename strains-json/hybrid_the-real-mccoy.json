    "description": "<p>The Real McCoy by The Flying Dutchmen is the progeny of a <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian\">Hawaiian</a> mother crossed with The Pure (AKA Original <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1\">Skunk No.1</a>). This heir of two classic old school genetics grows forest green buds accented by subtle purples hues. Its aroma is a combination of spilt oil and pungent skunk. The high is front-loaded by cerebral euphoria ideal for people watching, enjoying nature, or soaking in your favorite album. Its flavor is a complex layering of sweet floral tastes with funky and woody tones. The Real McCoy is great for relieving stress, relaxing your mind, and calibrating your focus with the present moment.&nbsp;</p>\n",

            "text": "The Real McCoy I'm specifically reviewing today is grown by High Noon Cultivators in Oregon. and is a parent of half their in-house creation, Irish Cream. (Hnc). \n\nI've experienced incredible physical pain since a severe car accident at age 10, where I was ejected from the back window because the SOB was so drunk he didn't bother to hit the brakes. At all. I'm in so much constant pain that I smoke at least 1/4oz each day, sometimes much more. Many, many different strains for many, many different possible moods or pain levels. \n\nIt's amazing.  A joint, maybe two, and everything stops hurting. STOPS!  \n\nSince New Years' day, I've obtained almost 1/4 pound of The Real McCoy.  This amazingly crafted cannabis strain eliminated every stupid, unnecessary negative thought my Chronic Anxiety Disorder tried to conjure up. Suddenly I'm bending and pivoting all over the place, singing along to Jagged Little Pill and Hootie & The Blowfish *yalookatmeeeeewegotnuthinleffasay* while I'm, ya know, cleaning. I'm Laughing longer and harder with family.  I get more accomplished at the office.\n\nI'm alive again.\n\nAnd their crew dances in their grow rooms like nobody's watching.",
