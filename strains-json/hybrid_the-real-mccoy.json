(Hnc). \n\nI\u0027ve experienced incredible physical pain since a severe car accident at age 10, where I was ejected from the back window because the SOB was so drunk he didn\u0027t bother to hit the brakes. At all. I\u0027m in so much constant pain that I smoke at least 1/4oz each day, sometimes much more. Many, many different strains for many, many different possible moods or pain levels. \n\nIt\u0027s amazing.  A joint, maybe two, and everything stops hurting. STOPS!  \n\nSince New Years\u0027 day, I\u0027ve obtained almost 1/4 pound of The Real McCoy.  This amazingly crafted cannabis strain eliminated every stupid, unnecessary negative thought my Chronic Anxiety Disorder tried to conjure up. Suddenly I\u0027m bending and pivoting all over the place, singing along to Jagged Little Pill and Hootie \u0026 The Blowfish *yalookatmeeeeewegotnuthinleffasay* while I\u0027m, ya know, cleaning. I\u0027m Laughing longer and harder with family.  I get more accomplished at the office.\n\nI\u0027m alive again.\n\nAnd their crew dances in their grow rooms like nobody\u0027s watching.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XOuQiyL_mfQJxAL08FKdI7sLjH0=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2fleafly-images%2fuser-profile%2f3xkCSlRQSWVEnDn5Ljhp_WEED.jpg"},{"id":1609462,"username":"Waveydane420","text":"Such a lovely strain! \nFlavourfull and packs a punch! \nReally impressed by this strain, lovely structure of the buds, so so frosty and takes away headaches and other muscle pains too!
