            "text": "This week's new strains survey a wide variety of effects and genetic origins.

            "text": "Remarkable strain, even amid the current proliferation of varried genetics; the first I've felt compelled to review and rate a 5.\n\nAs sampled 10/2014:\n\nThe flavor is at once familiar, owing to a very sweet and clean skunk flavor, and unique in the interplay with the chem twist. The resin production is heavy, sparkling; flowers a medium-heavy overall density; impressive for the strong sativa presentation in character. Genetics show 60/40 sat./ind. but the effect is more 80/20.\n\nEffect onset is rapid, strong, and noticeably prolonged; > 30 minutes. Mood lifting with dimensionality, glee; uncommonly so. Above average relief for chronic pain; fibromyalgia, arthritis, etc. I would highly recommend this as a low-dose medicine; not for novice or casual patients.\n\nI would not recommend this for muscle tension or anxiety as the high energy level may wind people up. While less paranoia-inducing than other especially high thc strains, this is a strong medicine that has the ability to surprise a regular user of high quality cannabis. Start with one or two medium pulls; don't rip it.\n\nThere is a markedly higher ceiling with Truth along with a much more comprehensive medicinal and theraputic profile than most.\n\nHowever the science of terpenes and cbd is mixed within this hybrid, its something distinct and uniquely beneficial; second most effective medicine I have had in the past decade.",
