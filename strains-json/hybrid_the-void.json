Mixed with Querkle and Apollo 13 (correct me if I'm wrong, thx).\r\n\r\nThe bud itself, has almost a 'caramel' hue to it, dusted white. (7/10)\r\n\r\n Smells like a skunk fucked a skunk. (8.5/10)\r\n\r\n.33 grams The Void in clean Wooden Pipe:\r\nEarthy, slightly sweet undertone, interesting piney overtone, medium smoke, reminds me of a kush. (8.5/10)\r\n\r\n:07 - initial effects: pleasant buzz in head, felt in front temple next to eyes, probably great for Glaucoma...\r\n:10 - cotton mouth, elevated heartbeat, (no paranoia, or anxiety) good for High Blood Pressure...\r\n:15 - buzz definitely peaking quick. Very relaxing and elevating, would be a great 'doing something' smoke.\r\n:35 - peak is over, clean even high. The Indy hits you more than the Sativa. Great party smoke, I feel sociable and focused, but WAY stoned.\r\n1:00 - STONED\r\n1:30 - ...\r\n1:45 - PROFIT!!!\r\n2:30 - coming down, I'm glued to the couch watching Discovery, don't remember when I started....\r\nOverall BUZZ.......---- (8/10)\r\n\r\nOVERALL CROP------ 8/10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

Made me very talkative (not able to hide the stoney speak & giggles), happy, pain, anxiety & nausea free!! \n\nThis makes me cough my lungs out in flower, but it is a kinda stale pre-roll. Think it would be great in concentrate! \n\nDamn! 5 drags & I\u2019m hit\ud83d\ude02.... a creeper that lasts awhile! Lookin for this again. Very happy, social, peaceful.  I wanna go sit in the hammock now. ",
