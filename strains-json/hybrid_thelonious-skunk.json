I have a recording suite and read and write musique both.   I am a serious musically individual made all that more serious by my constant Cannabis use.  My record collection now stands at 13 015 albums of musical tastes from Early Music or Ancient in some cases, to Opera to Rap, to Rock, to Blues and World Musique to Jazz one of my first musical loves.  Thelonious Monk and Nina Simone favour heavily!\n\nNow the segway into the strain review of a brand new favourite Skunk that I will be adding the strain up at the Chalet of this wonderfully delicious Thelomios Skunk !   This is a strain we picked up in the oldest and largest Dispensary in NYC. As we were in New York City following another Cancer Treatments in Rochester, New York.\n\nWe have already ordered clones of this strain from a Vermont Patient kind enough to us to drive the clones to the border between Vermont and Québec the Swanton, Vermont Border Crossing in early November.   We have known each the other for 25 years and have traded many strains North/South and/or South/North, with nary  a single problem !\n\nThis wondrous Sativa dominant Cannabis Strain is 70% Sativa and 30% Indica.   The indication from where we purchased the strain says that it’s 23,5% THC and 0,85 % CBD, 0,385 CBG.\n\nI particularly love, this Lemony Citrus strain a blend of Limone Simone and Sweet Island Skunk is now my favourited very early morning, waking strain.   I have been looking for such a Lemon Skunkish since the passing of Medpot Marc.   He introduced me to two all time super-favoured strains Sensi Seeds Black Domina and Lemon Skunk about 15 years ago.  \n\nThis is such a Euphoric strain it’s a wonder I had not known of this semence is a ouvragions happy strain great for introspection wonderfully a great for Chronic Pain as good as most heavy hitting Indica Stains and even some Pure Sativa pain killing stains which while fewer are as valued by serious Pain Patients.   I truelly love the Skunk exhale and the Citrus, Pine, Skunk Terpenes !!!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Fw0JEfqG0tfLyB-h0kujFvz9k-0=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2fleafly-images%2fuser-profile%2fYVopYOS5SXadF7Hukmhn_aj133670_LemonOGKush2.jpg"},{"id":1602175,"username":"lexustap","text":"This strain is nice, nice, nice, all the way around. Gentle on the intake, and I never cough or get an irritated throat from using this strain. I admit I decided to first try it because of the name and I associated it with an artsy, creative feeling at first. Fortunately it\u0027s also better than most seeming sativa-dominant strains for me with the pain relief. Wonderful as an antidepressant too, in fact I find myself giggling at the most stupid and mundane things when I\u0027m outside in the yard for instance; even the damn squirrels are fun to watch when I use this. This strain does not ramp up my anxiety either, and I can take life much less seriously so I can stop dwelling on all of the stuff that bothers me like the awful  injustices of the world, etc. OK, enough of that. I think the aroma and taste are more gentle than others I\u0027ve been using lately; it\u0027s not overtly sweet, fruity, earthy or skunky, just a nicely mixed balance of these and other things. I get a bit less of the dry mouth than with most other strains I use. Also my eyelids don\u0027t get all puffed up on one side only when I get good and lit, which often happens with others (definitely not a good look for me; I am not a pretty stoner, heehee.) Dancing to whatever freaking music happens to come up is fun with this, because my body loosens up and I become this supple dancer; I realize my hidden skills as my own personal choreographer.
