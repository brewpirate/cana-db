            "text": "Leafly\u2019s strain reviews are user-generated, meaning anyone who tries a strain can pull it up in our database and leave a review, rating the selection from one to five stars and offering up a little blurb about its effects, flavors, and any ailments or diseases it helped manage. They\u2019re informative, appreciated, and, well, often hilarious (the reviewers are often stoned, after all). But lately we noticed a recurring theme with some reviewers who are looking for a clever way to express how high they are and coming up about 12 feet short.\nI\u2019m talking, of course, about giraffe genitalia. Peruse this sampling of strain reviews and you\u2019ll understand what I mean:\n\u201cit\u2019s some fire. had me higher than giraffe nuts.\u201d\n\u201cSmoked one bowl on the way to Oxford. High as giraffe nuts!! By far my favorite strain!!!\u201d\n\u201cGoddamn. This strain is some old school shit, but goddamn. I\u2019m high as giraffe pussy right now.\u201d\nYou get the idea. Clever, right?\nNo. It isn\u2019t. Because, as this handy chart illustrates, giraffe genitals aren\u2019t actually that high:\nA human compared to a giraffe (diagram courtesy of Big-Animals.com)\nA male giraffe can grow up to 18 feet tall, and its legs are about six feet long. Logically, a giraffe\u2019s genitals are located near the top of its legs, making its intimate bits also about 5 1/2 \u2013 6 ft off the ground (give or take the \u201chang time\u201d of the organ in question). Thus, going back to the above chart, if you\u2019re \u201cas high\u201d or \u201chigher than\u201d a \u201cgiraffe\u2019s nuts,\u201d you\u2019re about as high as you are tall (within about a foot, depending on your height). That\u2019s not very high. Not very high at all. Essentially, when you exclaim that \u201cThis strain made me higher than a giraffe\u2019s balls!\u201d, what you\u2019re expressing is that a) you\u2019re actually quite functional, and b) you apparently think a giraffe is 150 feet tall.\nStoners, we can do better than this. Pick up a creative strain to get the juices flowing and come up with a better height analogy than a giraffe\u2019s giblets. Some suggestions:\n\n\u201cThis strain got me higher than the Burj Khalifa, which, at 2,722 feet, is the tallest building in the world!\u201d\n\u201cI got so blazed, I\u2019m as high as a redwood tree, which can grow up to 360 feet tall!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m higher than the glorious Angel Falls in Venezuela, the highest waterfall in the world at over 3,200 feet!\u201d\nOr, if you insist on sticking with the giraffe comparison, \u201cI\u2019m higher than a giraffe\u2019s ossicones, the horn-like protuberances on a giraffe\u2019s head!\u201d\n\nNow that you\u2019re armed with the newfound knowledge of things that are actually high up, pick up one of these strains that inspired a reviewer to think of a giraffe\u2019s babymaker (or receiver):\nChernobyl\n\n\u201cVeganic Chernobyl is fucking great! I\u2019m at Kyle Kushmans house pulling bong rips,and I\u2019m higher then giraffe pussy!! Big ups to Dioxide!!\nSour Diesel\n\n\u201cits flame. had me higher than giraffe nuts. it\u2019s some fire.\u201d\n\u201chad me higher than giraffe nuts.\u201d\nFlo\n\n\u201cFlo is one of my favorite strains perfect mix of Sativa fruity pebbles smell with an Indica kick to the head. High as a giraffes ass from the crumble.\u201d \u2013 Ryno602\nThin Mint GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\n\n\u201cgot the ogkb cut of this, completely covered in trichromes, looked like it was frozen!!! super duper, grade A+ smoke. had me high as a giraffes ass!\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0stankynuggsackz\nOG Kush\n\n\u201cSmoked one bowl on the way to Oxford. High as giraffe nuts!! By far my favorite strain!!!\u201d\u00a0\u2013 SwisherSmoke\nBlue Dream\n\n\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m here to tell you that \u201cI\u2019m am higher than giraffe pussy on this 16th day of July in the year of or great lord 2015.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 airblown\nNorthern Lights\n\n\u201cGoddamn. This strain is some old school shit, but goddamn. I\u2019m high as giraffe pussy right now.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0siredmundduke\nCherry Pie\n\n\u201cThis is some loud shit y\u2019all packed the one hitter once and got high than a giraffes pussy no b.s.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Kodak1\n\u2026and finally, one reviewer who got it right:\nGranddaddy Purple\n\n\u201cDis shit got me high as a fucking giraffe\u201d\u00a0\u2013 JamesBongg\nI\u2019ll allow it, because giraffes are pretty high. (Although, as we now know, their genitals are not.)",
