Glad this was on special today as I may have never tried due to the name.It has the best of both worlds, seemingly indica Dominant but the high is energizing, relaxed, and  creative feeling great head high and body buzz. When you come down your not all tired either.",

Versatile can be used as a day time chill smoke or at night a more sedating smoke \nStrains like this make me thankful for being in a medical state, I have severe scoliosis and one side of my lower back is constantly burning or cramping from the one side of the muscle holding up both sides.. This strain makes it stop almost immediately.\nGreat for nausea & it helps you gain an appetite.\nSuper awesome I got this in shatter form by Clear Concentrates, the brand of The Nirvana Center Phoenix. \nHas an earthy dank skunk taste.\nNo clue what the name has to do with it but I don't care it's a great strain to try.",
