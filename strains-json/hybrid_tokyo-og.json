Her smell alone will knock you on your ass. The taste is a frosty og with a subtle bite to the burn but not as sharp As some SFV  can be. A very dense smoke and quite the lung filler. Two hits from a glass pipe and the room is full of smoke and it\u0027s couch lock city for 2 hours plus. This strain is a SoCal dispensarie\u0027s riserva Pravda and it\u0027s always tested above 21 percent total thc and thca. A true example of conesiour genetics. Crystals cover the stocky and dense buds and just from its scent you know it\u0027s hiding a treasure trove of indica inspired relaxation within it\u0027s folds of OG goodness. Only side effect is a severe case of the munchies, a real gut filler.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1548424,"username":"GeneralAmnesty","text":"after this one hit wonder the phrase \"mood elevator\" came quickly to mind.......when i returned to the dispensary, i ordered another eighth, well done","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3321","title":"New Strains Alert: Kill Bill, Viper, California Grapefruit, Tokyo OG, and White Haze","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1412974800000)\/","text":"It\u0027s Friday, which means it\u0027s time to kick off the weekend with some tempting new strains! This week, we\u0027ve got some vicious new varieties like Kill Bill and Viper, as well as the flavorful California Grapefruit, the energizing White Haze, and the potent Tokyo OG.
