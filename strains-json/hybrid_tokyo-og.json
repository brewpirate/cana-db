            "text": "This is a beautiful OG hybrid, indica dominant female. Her smell alone will knock you on your ass. The taste is a frosty og with a subtle bite to the burn but not as sharp As some SFV  can be. A very dense smoke and quite the lung filler. Two hits from a glass pipe and the room is full of smoke and it's couch lock city for 2 hours plus. This strain is a SoCal dispensarie's riserva Pravda and it's always tested above 21 percent total thc and thca. A true example of conesiour genetics. Crystals cover the stocky and dense buds and just from its scent you know it's hiding a treasure trove of indica inspired relaxation within it's folds of OG goodness. Only side effect is a severe case of the munchies, a real gut filler.",
