WSU\n\nWSU is a Washington-grown rendition of the indica strain Chemo and it\u2019s waiting for you on the shelves of recreational stores state-wide. Named in homage to Washington State University, don\u2019t confuse this strain with the UW indica, whose name is derived from the rivaling University of Washington. Its effects are described as relaxed and spacey.

Training Day\n\nBred by DNA Genetics, Training Day is a 70% indica that combines parent strains Trainwreck and LA Confidential. This California native takes after its LA Confidential parent in aroma and delivers a pungent earthy and pine flavor. As demonstrated by its thick blanket of crystal resin, Training Day will put your THC tolerance to the test so novices should approach this strain with caution.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Training Day\n\u00a0\n 7. OG Chem\n\nOG Chem, also called Chem OG, is a sativa-dominant cross between two legendary strains, Chemdawg and OG Kush.

            "text": "Lol,  nutty?  There is no dominant nutty terpenoids. Just like \"garlic\".  These buds have soaked up the smell of organic pesticides. Its in the plant fiber, not the resins, very easy to tell once you start vaporizing like a modern tokers should. \n\nSame with these stupid \"milk\"  strains.  Do they come with instructions on how to grow them?  With pesticides that smell nutty, garlicy or milky?  Unless the buds smell like a Chinese restaurant, that \"nutty\"  smell is Azadirachtin, a controversial birth defect causing nut derived pesticide. I never smelled any of this crap out of the hundreds of lbs of Northwest bud that passed through my hands.  Real growers know better than to grows strains dependent on pesticides.  Stay away from the nutty butty!  Once you learn how Cannabis phenotypes differ from each other,  you can grasp the fact that this weed is commercially grown in Az, and does not reflect medical quality Cannabis in any regard. ",
