    "description": "<p>Toxic is a strain created from two of Ripper Seeds&rsquo; most award-winning strains, Ripper Haze x Criminal. This combination bends supplementary parts of the <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/haze\">Haze</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-mass\">Critical Mass</a> lineages to fashion a potent and dense flower with natural resistance to pests and mold. These natural resistances alongside the 60-65 day flowering time make Toxic an ideal strain for outdoor growers. Its abundance of <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-are-trichomes-on-cannabis\">trichomes</a> and overall resin production also make it a perfect strain for extraction.
