Leafly and Botanicare are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Purple Trainwreck is a cross between Mendocino Purps and Trainwreck. Both parent strains are well-known in the California scene, and Purple Trainwreck follows in their footsteps. Known for its large yields and resistance to disease and mold, this strain has been a longtime favorite for outdoor cultivators.\nGrow Techniques: Grow this strain outdoors if you can. Healthy soils and exposure to sunlight will allow this strain to grow large. Top once when the plant is a few feet tall and again every few weeks until it reaches flowering; this will allow the plant to grow into an even bush of buds. If you prune and stake the branches, you will be well rewarded.\nFlowering Time: 8 to 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate \nClimate: Purple Trainwreck resists mold well and tolerates colder temperatures. While harsh weather can lower the yield, this plant can push through some tough times. Ideally, Purple Trainwreck should be grown between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: If you have the option, grow this strain outdoors where it has enough space to take off.\nFeeding: Healthy soil at the beginning of the season will get Purple Trainwreck started on the right foot. Compost tea can improve the plant’s vitality, and top dressing the soil with phosphorus-dense nutrients at the beginning of flowering will keep Purple Trainwreck growing at full speed.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/23140700/purple-trainwreck-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-purple-trainwreck-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":2446,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":16.738497188378531},{"name":"Pine","score":15.1521448539173},{"name":"Lemon","score":9.7006187939726622},{"name":"Pungent","score":8.8151242129885823},{"name":"Diesel","score":7.1261550154671776}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":69.5974408676752},{"name":"Relaxed","score":62.235555934584944},{"name":"Euphoric","score":61.835252276474},{"name":"Uplifted","score":51.436491275092621},{"name":"Energetic","score":39.021810291374571}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":29.373628467557829},{"name":"Depression","score":26.212066514527692},{"name":"Pain","score":26.008786891510887},{"name":"Fatigue","score":16.149102395002629},{"name":"Headaches","score":12.400581731738248}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":27.362365844436511},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":21.003923809108546},{"name":"PTSD","score":13.1163509430244},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":8.5611196642084622},{"name":"Migraines","score":8.1591536558773683}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":27.03205188627323},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":20.011572864374237},{"name":"Anxious","score":10.668857378152563},{"name":"Dizzy","score":9.6796286167472143},{"name":"Paranoid","score":9.5753616934235044}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_b192.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1005409/b/trainwreck__primary_b21b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_4a37.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000019/b/trainwreck__primary_7242.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_78b6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/707856/b/trainwreck__primary_8f41.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_18d5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/660814/b/trainwreck__primary_97ca.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_1b63.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/655856/b/trainwreck__primary_285c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_7dd8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/645770/b/trainwreck__primary_996c.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":563,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Toronto, ON","Los Angeles, CA","Seattle, WA","Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Vancouver, BC","Edmonton, AB","Eugene, OR","Las Vegas, NV"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.25388389206868/240","testGraph":"https://leafly.s3.amazonaws.com/strains/testing/xfn6FgUCSSibJM1mZ0H0_trainwreck.png","weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Mexican","subtitle":null,"slug":"mexican","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/mexican","symbol":"Mex","applink":"leafly://strain/mexican"},{"name":"Thai","subtitle":null,"slug":"thai","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/thai","symbol":"Tha","applink":"leafly://strain/thai"},{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Leafly and Botanicare are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Purple Trainwreck is a cross between Mendocino Purps and Trainwreck. Both parent strains are well-known in the California scene, and Purple Trainwreck follows in their footsteps. Known for its large yields and resistance to disease and mold, this strain has been a longtime favorite for outdoor cultivators.\nGrow Techniques: Grow this strain outdoors if you can. Healthy soils and exposure to sunlight will allow this strain to grow large. Top once when the plant is a few feet tall and again every few weeks until it reaches flowering; this will allow the plant to grow into an even bush of buds. If you prune and stake the branches, you will be well rewarded.\nFlowering Time: 8 to 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate \nClimate: Purple Trainwreck resists mold well and tolerates colder temperatures. While harsh weather can lower the yield, this plant can push through some tough times. Ideally, Purple Trainwreck should be grown between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: If you have the option, grow this strain outdoors where it has enough space to take off.\nFeeding: Healthy soil at the beginning of the season will get Purple Trainwreck started on the right foot. Compost tea can improve the plant’s vitality, and top dressing the soil with phosphorus-dense nutrients at the beginning of flowering will keep Purple Trainwreck growing at full speed.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/23140700/purple-trainwreck-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-purple-trainwreck-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":2446,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":16.738497188378531},{"name":"Pine","score":15.1521448539173},{"name":"Lemon","score":9.7006187939726622},{"name":"Pungent","score":8.8151242129885823},{"name":"Diesel","score":7.1261550154671776}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":69.5974408676752},{"name":"Relaxed","score":62.235555934584944},{"name":"Euphoric","score":61.835252276474},{"name":"Uplifted","score":51.436491275092621},{"name":"Energetic","score":39.021810291374571}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":29.373628467557829},{"name":"Depression","score":26.212066514527692},{"name":"Pain","score":26.008786891510887},{"name":"Fatigue","score":16.149102395002629},{"name":"Headaches","score":12.400581731738248}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":27.362365844436511},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":21.003923809108546},{"name":"PTSD","score":13.1163509430244},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":8.5611196642084622},{"name":"Migraines","score":8.1591536558773683}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":27.03205188627323},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":20.011572864374237},{"name":"Anxious","score":10.668857378152563},{"name":"Dizzy","score":9.6796286167472143},{"name":"Paranoid","score":9.5753616934235044}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_b192.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1005409/b/trainwreck__primary_b21b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_4a37.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000019/b/trainwreck__primary_7242.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_78b6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/707856/b/trainwreck__primary_8f41.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_18d5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/660814/b/trainwreck__primary_97ca.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_1b63.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/655856/b/trainwreck__primary_285c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/trainwreck_100x100_7dd8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/645770/b/trainwreck__primary_996c.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":563,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Toronto, ON","Los Angeles, CA","Seattle, WA","Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Vancouver, BC","Edmonton, AB","Eugene, OR","Las Vegas, NV"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.25388389206868/240","testGraph":"https://leafly.s3.amazonaws.com/strains/testing/xfn6FgUCSSibJM1mZ0H0_trainwreck.png","weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Mexican","subtitle":null,"slug":"mexican","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/mexican","symbol":"Mex","applink":"leafly://strain/mexican"},{"name":"Thai","subtitle":null,"slug":"thai","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/thai","symbol":"Tha","applink":"leafly://strain/thai"},{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
