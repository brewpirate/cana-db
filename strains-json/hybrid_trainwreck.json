            "text": "Leafly\u2019s Faves is a series providing a glimpse into the strains, products, and brands that our team of cannabis aficionados is buying, consuming, and enjoying the most every year. Some are entirely new to the market, while others are simply perennial favorites that we can\u2019t recommend enough. Below, find our crew\u2019s favorite cannabis concentrates of 2017. How many have you tried? What was\u00a0your\u00a0favorite concentrate of 2017? Share with us in the comments below!\n\nDouble Tangie Banana Sugar Resin by Oleum Extracts\nAvailable in: Washington\nBursting with citrus aroma, Oleum Extracts\u2019 delicious Double Tangie Banana Sugar Resin brings maximum flavor along with buzzy sativa-dominant qualities. We love it for its huge terpene profile, and find it to beget a subtle, controllable high with each and every dab.\nSpace Queen Cartridge by Artizen Cannabis\nAvailable in: Washington\nNotes of bold cherry mixed with a soft vanilla scent are found in Artizen\u2019s hybrid Space Queen Cartridge.

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Purple Trainwreck is a cross between Mendocino Purps and Trainwreck. Both parent strains are well-known in the California scene, and Purple Trainwreck follows in their footsteps. Known for its large yields and resistance to disease and mold, this strain has been a longtime favorite for outdoor cultivators.\nGrow Techniques: Grow this strain outdoors if you can. Healthy soils and exposure to sunlight will allow this strain to grow large. Top once when the plant is a few feet tall and again every few weeks until it reaches flowering; this will allow the plant to grow into an even bush of buds. If you\u00a0prune and stake the branches, you will be well rewarded.\nFlowering Time: 8 to 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\u00a0\nClimate: Purple Trainwreck resists mold well and tolerates colder temperatures. While harsh weather can lower the yield, this plant can push through some tough times. Ideally, Purple Trainwreck should be grown between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: If you have the option, grow this strain outdoors where it has enough space to take off.\nFeeding: Healthy soil at the beginning of the season will get Purple Trainwreck started on the right foot. Compost tea can improve the plant\u2019s vitality, and top dressing the soil with phosphorus-dense nutrients at the beginning of flowering will keep Purple Trainwreck growing at full speed.",

You'd think a strain named Trainwreck would leave your broken body sprawled out by the tracks while confused NTSB investigators poked at your corpse, but not this stuff: this Trainwreck wants to kill you with kindness. And it is SO kind. We're talking Uncle John's Band kind. From the first limey hit, Trainwreck wraps its arms around you like your old Nana and whispers that everything is going to be ok. Then it leaves you alone for a couple of minutes before sneaking up and lifting you gently to cruising altitude. From there, it's like being seated on the world's most comfortable couch at 20,000 feet -- for about two hours. The high won't leave you glued to your chair, nor will it make you get up and dance: this is sitting by the river listening to Tame Impala with your friends kinda weed. This is good times, big smiles and warm days. This is dancing to the Dead and getting a hug from a pretty girl (or boy -- whatever your wont!). Why they called this stuff Trainwreck is beyond me; I guess \"Just Good Cannabis\" didn't have the same impact. Maybe \"Thomas the Dank Engine\"? Shit, that's already taken. Anyway, smoke some of this shit and you'll feel good. The end.",
