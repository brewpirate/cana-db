            "text": "Early in the morning after the massive 4/20 rally in Toronto last month, organizer Chris Goodwin drove past the public square where the rally had taken place. He liked what he saw.\n\u201cThe square looked like we had never been there,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is what we wanted \u2014\u00a0clean in, clean out with no damage to anything.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not the rule in every city. Last week Denver Mayor Michael Hancock\u2019s administration declared that the organizers of this year\u2019s 4/20 rally would not be issued permits for the event for at least three years. The reason? Trash, among other things.\n(Denver Post)\nAfter this year\u2019s rally in Civic Center Park, which featured a concert by 2 Chainz, mounds of trash remained in the park the following morning. \u201cLeaving the trash overnight in the park, even if bagged, is not effective or timely removal of trash from the park,\u201d city officials wrote in an 11-page letter to event organizers.\nRob Corry, general counsel for the group organizing the event, told the Denver Post that the event permit allowed the group to continue the cleanup through the following day, and \u201cwe leave the park cleaner than we received it.\u201d\nIt may be an issue of when that cleanup was done. Timeliness and public perception matter. On April 21, the Post ran a headline (\u201cWho trashed Civic Center Park? Denver wakes up to a sea of garbage, but organizers say park was cleaned after 4/20 rally\u201d) over a story that included photos of boxes, newspapers, packing peanuts, and discarded banners strewn about Civic Center Park.\nMeanwhile, Up North\u2026\nIn Toronto and Vancouver, there were few complaints about garbage removal after 4/20. What made the difference? In part, budgeting and planning.\nThe 4/20 rally in Toronto is a major event. Thousands jam the square to enjoy live performances, visit booths selling everything from T-shirts to paraphernalia or grab a bite to eat at one of the many food trucks nearby. Organizer Chris Goodwin tends to every detail of the event \u2014\u00a0and takes steps to ensure there is no messy fallout. He says he spent about $5,000, approximately 10 percent of the event\u2019s total budget, on garbage cleanup.\n\nAs required by the city, he paid a crew affiliated with the local Business Improvement Association (BIA) to circle the area surrounding the square, two or three blocks away from it, and pick up garbage left by people leaving the rally.\nHe also bought a hundred industrial-sized garbage bins and spread them out across the square. \u201cBut no matter how well you manage the situation, no matter how many times you empty the bins, there is still going to be trash on the ground,\u201d he says, speaking from experience. So additional steps have to be taken.\nAt the end of the festivities this year, Goodwin cut the zip ties holding up a 30-foot banner and, with the help of five others, walked through the square with the banner fully extended, prodding stragglers to leave the area the way a cowcatcher at the front of a train clears the track of obstructions.\n\nWhen the square was empty, 20 employees of a private cleaning company Goodwin had hired sprang into action. They swept back and forth across the square with giant shovels, clearing the garbage like a snowplow clearing Toronto streets in winter. There was nary a complaint from city officials.\nWhat\u2019s the key to effective garbage management at 4/20 rallies? It\u2019s simple, says Goodwin. \u201cThe key is to stop relying on volunteers because they\u2019re not accountable. They just leave when they\u2019re tired,\u201d he says. \u201cI notice that some rally organizers have been recruiting volunteers by offering incentives such as free marijuana or T-shirts. I don\u2019t do that. I just hire professionals to do the job.\u201d\nVancouver: 35,000 People, 5,000 lbs. of\u00a0Trash\nVancouver 4/20 organizer Dana Larsen recruited volunteers to clean up the trash at this year\u2019s event at Sunset Beach. \u201cWe had about a dozen people collecting garbage during the event but we were still cleaning up at 3 a.m. and many of the volunteers had gone home by then,\u201d says Larsen, who was still in his official rally attire, a three-piece suit, at that point. \u201cThose of us who were left had to drag the trash to the top of a hill for the sanitation trucks to collect it \u2014\u00a0and that was taxing.\u201d\nLarsen and his volunteers even made the trash cleanup a feature of their\u00a0Twitter feeds that day.\n\n#420van volunteers are working overnight to clean up leftover mess on #SunsetBeach @DanaLarsen @ParkBoard pic.twitter.com/2CL5ENnK7Y\n\u2014 Gian-Paolo Mendoza (@gpsmendoza) April 21, 2017\n\n\u00a0\nFinally home after cleaning Sunset Beach for 5 hours after 4/20. Did my first interview today at 7:30am, last one at 3am during clean-up.\n\u2014 Dana Larsen (@DanaLarsen) April 21, 2017\n\nIn subsequent days, there was a public hue and cry about damage to grass; much of the park\u2019s turf had turned to mud during the rain-drenched rally, and park officials said the area would have to be closed for five weeks to recover. Larsen offered to have his organization pay to have the area re-seeded, and park officials agreed.\nDespite their anger over the turf, however, officials commended organizers on trash management. Howard Normann, director of parks, said he was pleased to find that most garbage \u2014 almost 5,000 lbs. of it \u2014 had been picked up by volunteers. \u201cGenerally, it\u2019s looking pretty good this year compared to last year,\u201d he told the CBC. \u201cI\u2019m quite pleased with the lack of garbage.\u201d\nNonetheless, Larsen now believes there is a better way to get the job done. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising how much garbage people can generate. We\u2019re going to hire a professional crew to take care of it next year,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re learning more as we go.\u201d",

            "text": "This week\u2019s New Strains Alert is for all my dawgs\u00a0running wild all over the world. This\u00a0pack of feral beasts trots the Chemdawg continuum and marks its territory with the chemical essence the genetic parentage is known for. We've also added Trash, Moonwalker Kush, and Ridge Berry to give these hounds a few\u00a0activities to get into. Round up your dawgs and spark up \u2014 these strains are howlers!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a01. Dawgfather OG\n\nDawgfather OG, or simply \u201cThe Dawgfather,\u201d is an indica-dominant hybrid created by AlphaKronik Genes capable of massive plant production and a healthier-than-average yield. With potency floating above 20%, this strain contends well with chronic pain, insomnia, Crohn's, and anxiety. Expect traditional notes of gas/chemicals, Kush, and some funkiness. Dawgfather OG offers a strong buzz with nuance worth exploring.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a02. Bloodhound\n\nBloodhound is the obscure cross of Huckleberry Hound and Guard Dawg (by RedEyed Genetics). This genetic coupling was motivated by the desire to preserve the beautiful foliage and tartness of Huckleberry Hound while co-opting Guard Dawg\u2019s potency. With a decent yield and THC percentage upwards of 24%, this strain smells of tart fruit intermixed with an earthy chocolate fondue flavor.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a03. Huckleberry Hound\n\nHuckleberry Hound is an obscure hybrid that has alleged roots in Blueberry and Chemdawg families. With notes of berry intermixed with a palatable melange of chemicals, this flower's bouquet is challenging but worthwhile. Expect airy body effects that take on more weight with time and cerebral effects that remind many of a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-diesel\" >Sour Diesel\u2019s type of mental stimuli. Most Chemdawg lineage is potent, so be aware, as this strain is a howler.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a04. Guard Dawg\n\nGuard Dawg is an indica-dominant phenotype bred by RedEyed Genetics. This flower\u2019s genetic parentage is a combination of Abusive OG and TreStardawg. The plant smells of its OG heritage with overtones of caramel and coffee bean. But watch out! This strain packs a wallop and is recommended for nighttime use only.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a05. Moonwalker Kush\n\nMoonwalker Kush is a balanced indica-dominant hybrid that is the genetic cross of Triple OG and Tahoe Alien. This odoriferous combination speaks volumes through its scent, which is thick with soured earth and a hint of pepper on the finish. The herbaceous terpene profile aligns nicely with this strain\u2019s intense relaxation and moderate cerebral effects. Try Moonwalker Kush after dark to harness the sedative effects nestled below layers of trichomes and brown pistils.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a06. Ridge Berry\n\nRidge Berry by Marley Natural is a succulent and stimulating sativa-dominant strain that imbues the consumer with energy right away, but leans back into alert sedation over time. The latent indica parentage consists of Chem\u2019s Sister and Sour Dubble, and shows up as a warm airy sensation in the body, making this strain ideal for pain management. Ridge Berry's crystalline buds smell of pine, berry, and a touch of fuel.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a07. Trash\n\nTrash is an indica-dominant hybrid that is anything but garbage. This strain crosses Purple Trainwreck against Afghani Hash Plant, blending the mental alertness of Trainwreck with the resin production and deep, earthy aroma native to Afghani genetics. Trash is an ideal smoke for long bouts of video games or other stationary activities. These effects also lend themselves to patients suffering from chronic pain and nausea.\n\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",
