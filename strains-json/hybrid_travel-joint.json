            "text": "Vegas sucks. You know it; I know it; everyone knows it. Vegas is a booze-soaked money grab that if you\u2019ve done once, you\u2019ve done a million times. Yet every time the season rolls around, we all find ourselves booking that room at The Cosmopolitan (best beds of all time) as if we expect it to be different this time around.\nSpoiler alert: This time around it will be different. Because there\u2019s legal weed to be had. Now that Nevada has legalized recreational cannabis use for adults 21 and up, switch your cocktails for cannabinoids and learn how to actually have fun in this city.\nStep one: Hit a dispensary. There are many. I was able to check out two solid ones during my recent visit:\n\nThe Apothecary Shoppe. Product suggestions: Big Smooth (flower), Las Vegas Haze (pre-roll), Chocolate Chip Cookies (edibles).\nEssence Vegas. Product suggestions: Power Plant (pre-roll), Travel Joint (pre-roll), Cadillac Purple (flower).\n\nStep two: Find a place to consume. I\u2019d strongly advise against smoking in your hotel room (unless you\u2019re staying in one of these ones). Of course, public consumption remains illegal, so I\u2019d also strongly advise against that too. However, I will say that there may or may not be a staircase behind Mandalay Bay that no one EVER walks by or through. I will also say that it may OR MAY NOT be the most perfect spot in all of Vegas to enjoy the flowers of your labor. But, you know, that\u2019s only if it exists, which it may or may not.\nStep three: Indulge in one of the following activities. In no particular order, we give you the best things to do as a high cannabis tourist in Las Vegas.\nEat at Nacho Daddy\nIf you do nothing else, make sure to eat at Nacho Daddy. My boy Sutton put me on game and it was the greatest decision I made that whole weekend. $15 won\u2019t get you much in Vegas, but at Nacho Daddy it gets you a big-ass plate of filet mignon (cause I\u2019m fancy like that) nachos that\u2019ll have you feeling like maybe calories aren\u2019t such a bad thing.\nWander Old Vegas and Fremont Street\n(Jacek_Sopotnicki/iStock)\nUp until this last trip, I\u2019d never been to the famous \u201cOld Vegas\u201d that I\u2019d heard so much about. Oh boy is it an experience. It\u2019s the only place I\u2019ve ever been where, within a 437-step distance, you can see a near-naked man dressed as a baby, followed by two white dudes with dreads battle rapping, followed by a bum dropping a deuce by the sunglasses kiosk like the world is his oyster. If you\u2019re planning to a trip to Las Vegas, do yourself a favor, and take a trip downtown for the most Bruh, I\u2019m Way Too High For This Shit experience that the city has to offer.\nWalk the Vegas Strip\nObviously, right? If you touch Vegas and don\u2019t wander aimlessly down the Strip (and then realize it\u2019s actually a lot longer than it looks and now you\u2019re so far from your hotel that you need to catch a Lyft back because your thighs are on fire), then did you really touch Vegas?\nGet high and go on a walk down this street and you\u2019ll find ample bright lights, photo opportunities, and enough street entertainment to keep you busy all night long. Plus there\u2019s hella trash food for you to stop and grab, which is all my happiness requires.\nBacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace\n(Cybernesco/iStock)\nSpeaking of food, eat at a buffet. Every hotel has one, but if you want the best one? Bacchanal Buffet in Caesars Palace is the answer, my pals.\nThe bad news is that it\u2019ll cost you 50 whole entire dollars, but the good news is they have lobster eggs Benedict and mac and cheese AT THE SAME DAMN TIME. And chicken and waffles. And an entire dessert station. They have it all. Get high, hit BB, and don\u2019t stop eating until you feel $50 of satisfaction in your stomach. I saw a guy take off his shoes and get comfortable because he was full, but hadn\u2019t recouped his money in food yet. Be like that American hero.\nPool Party\nEncore reigns supreme, but honestly, each pool party or beach club offers the same experience: overpriced drinks that never hit because the sun is killing your buzz, and pools of water that are probably half chlorine and half gonorrhea.\nBut hey, at least whatever DJ they booked is playing an excessive amount of UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ, right? RIGHT?! Wrong, but the reason these make the list is because they\u2019re excellent for getting high and people-watching. Trust me.\nDrais Nightclub\n(gruizza/iStock)\nThis is the one club that I\u2019ll absolutely swear by in Vegas. So many artists have residencies here that on any given night you might catch Trey Songz or somebody in concert for the lowest Vegas price possible ($40 for women, $70 for men). I saw Tory Lanez there, and he put on one of the best live shows I\u2019ve ever seen. A friend of mine saw Jeezy there. Last time, I was supposed to go see T.I. but ended up getting too high and passing out. Shout out to Cadillac Purple.\nSee a Show\nVegas shows will hit you for a grip, but in all fairness, so will everything else. At least with these you get some kind of worthwhile return on investment, in the form of a live performance and new experience.\nI\u2019ve only seen the Jabbawockeez and the Blue Man Group, but I can promise you that both of these shows are worth the high, ESPECIALLY the Blue Man Group. They don\u2019t talk, they just make noise and do physical humor. Perfect stoner activity.\nGo Skydiving\n(Rene_Keller/iStock)\nEver gotten super-stoned, then dropped out of a plane with another man strapped to your back? I have. It\u2019s fun as hell too. Vegas offers multiple skydiving spots on the Strip, but the real deal is Skydive Las Vegas, which is about 20\u201330 minutes from the Strip. According to the company, they\u2019ll take you higher than any other skydiving spot out there \u2026 and getting higher is what we\u2019re all about.\nBellagio Water Show\nThe Fountains of Bellagio are pretty cool to see, especially at night. It\u2019s the perfect thing to settle in and stare at indefinitely after you hit a pre-roll or vape pen. It\u2019s also one of the only things in Vegas that\u2019ll leave you like, \u201cWow, fam, that was mad beautiful and touching.\u201d Mainly because you\u2019ll be so high that everything gets you in your feelings.\nGamble and Ruin Your Life\n(Sezeryadigar/iStock)\nIt\u2019s a monster that you run and run and run from, but eventually it\u2019ll catch you. And once it does, say goodbye to any budget you thought you had. It\u2019s so easy to be walking through a casino lobby and accidentally end up in front of the War table with a stack of $5 chips and a mind full of, \u201cSomeone has to win; why not me?\u201d It\u2019s even easier to walk away from that table six minutes later with 200 less dollars than you had. Being high won\u2019t ease the pain of losing money on some dumb shit, but it WILL make it a lot easier for you to say, \u201cFuck it. At least those nachos were fire.\u201d",
