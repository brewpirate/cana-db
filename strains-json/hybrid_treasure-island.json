            "text": "This was a pleasant but odd surprise. Even on balance strains I still get a bit of the THC head buzz. It's manageable, but it's there. On this strain, it's very, very faint. Faint to the point where you don't feel \"high\". This was both trying it by vape and also trying it by smoking a bowl.\n\nThe breakdown I was given on this blend from my dispensary was a potential of 14.21% CBD, and 1.06% THC.\n\nThe effect? At first I thought it was a very \"meh\" mood it put me in, but on my second round, it was more of a \"zen\" mood. Calm, relaxed, but not too distracted. Most of this hit my body - I felt relaxed, the muscle pain was there but it was like the volume was turned way down. At the gym I felt I was more flexible and could push myself a bit further (safely, of course). \n\nAs to the smell - at first you do smell the lavender, but after a few days you smell mostly an earthly smell with hints of herbs and spices. Tasting it however you can taste a floral note, which is probably the lavender as it had a soapy note (NOTE: that's just my reaction to floral scents; even in cologne I find them \"soapy\") however it was actually quite pleasant. \n\nThis is not a blend to make you sleepy or super THC energetic hyperactive. It is a blend to have when you need to get stuff done and you want the pain to go away. I wouldn't say happy, but I would say relaxed and chilled out...",
