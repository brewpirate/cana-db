So they call this #25,violet-but in reality it\u0027s tres dawg. Anyways great strain, especially if you\u0027re an indica lover(like me.) it\u0027s actually a hybrid but definitely an indica dominant one.  A little goes a long way with this strain. Relaxing, helps with pain(I shattered my ankle in a really bad car accident last year so it hurts....a lot,) sleepy and while you do get the munchies somewhat, it\u0027s not like you want to eat everything in sight. Wouldn\u0027t recommend for before work. I smoked one time \u0026 it made me a little paranoid. It\u0027s much better for a night time, chilling strain.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1555854,"username":"MadameGreen3988","text":"so if your female this is the one when your monthly friend comes stock up on this one...","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3329","title":"New Strains Alert: LAPD, Orange Haze, Tahoe OG Kush, and Tres Dawg","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1394776740000)\/","text":"Hybridized strains have flooded the cannabis market over the past few decades, bringing us unlimited variety that Leafly will always celebrate. Beginning in the 1970s, growers scoured nature for indigenous cannabis varieties known as landrace strains. These original genetics would give rise to the vast collection of strains we see on dispensary shelves today. We realize many of you prefer the pure indicas and sativas, but we’ve added four new strains for the hybrid lovers out there. \nAre these strains old news to you?
