            "text": "Hybridized strains have flooded the cannabis market over the past few decades, bringing us unlimited variety that Leafly will always celebrate. Beginning in the 1970s, growers scoured nature for indigenous cannabis varieties known as landrace strains. These original genetics would give rise to the vast collection of strains we see on dispensary shelves today. We realize many of you prefer the pure indicas and sativas, but we\u2019ve added four new strains for the hybrid\u00a0lovers out there.\u00a0\nAre these strains old news to you? Leave a review and tell us what you thought about them!\n1. LAPD\nCharacteristics of LAPD:\n\n50/50 hybrid\nAlso known as LA Confidential Purple Diesel\nCross between\u00a0LA Confidential\u00a0and\u00a0Purple Diesel\nGrape, pine, and pepper aroma\nEffects can include mellow, cerebral euphoria\u00a0and\u00a0physical calm\nCommonly used for pain, cramps, stress, and fatigue\nFlowers in 50 to 60 days\n\n2. Orange Haze\nCharacteristics of Orange Haze:\n\n65% sativa-dominant hybrid\nCross between\u00a0Orange Bud\u00a0and\u00a0Haze\nBreeder: Green Devil Genetics\nCitrus aroma\nEffects can include\u00a0energy, focus, euphoria, and creativity\nFlowers in 64 days\n\n3. Tahoe OG Kush\nCharacteristics of Tahoe OG Kush:\n\n60% sativa-dominant hybrid\nCross between\u00a0Tahoe OG\u00a0and\u00a0SFV OG Kush\nBreeder: Cali Connection\nLemon aroma\nEffects can include relaxing, calming effects\nTypically used to treat chronic pain, insomnia, and stress\nFlowers in 70 days\n\n4.

            "text": "So for some reason at my dispensary (well in all of Ct) they can't use \"street strain names,) like Sour diesel, or OG kush. So they call this #25,violet-but in reality it's tres dawg. Anyways great strain, especially if you're an indica lover(like me.) it's actually a hybrid but definitely an indica dominant one.  A little goes a long way with this strain. Relaxing, helps with pain(I shattered my ankle in a really bad car accident last year so it hurts....a lot,) sleepy and while you do get the munchies somewhat, it's not like you want to eat everything in sight. Wouldn't recommend for before work. I smoked one time & it made me a little paranoid. It's much better for a night time, chilling strain.",
