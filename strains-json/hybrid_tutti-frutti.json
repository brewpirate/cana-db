Light green with an orange/yellow powdery coat (many trichomes).\n\nSmell: A) Sweet lavender smell at first. Second time, heaven of berry, oranges, or is it really?! Could not resiste to sniff it again and again!\n\nTaste: B+) Very sweet on inhale, but not so nice on exhale and a bit harsh. Makes me wanna cought.\n\nEffects: A+) What suprise me most about it. Maked me instantly happy, then thinking and talkative. After the first big hit you know you'll be baked.
