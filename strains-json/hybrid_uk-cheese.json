            "text": "To celebrate America's Independence Day, we\u2019ve compiled reviews for strains that have made our Leafly reviewers feel particularly patriotic. For maximum enjoyment, we recommend sparking these strains while watching fireworks, enjoying tasty treats at your best friend\u2019s BBQ, or just lazing around lakeside on a sunny summer day. Happy 4th of July, everyone!\n\u00a0\nSome strains wake you up with American passion:\n\n\nGOOD MORNING POT SMOKING AMERICA! \u2013Samurai_JAC\n\n\u00a0\nOkay, so Led Zeppelin is not the most patriotic music to listen to, but America is all about that FREEDOM!\n\n\nBaked like an apple pie on the 4th of July!! enjoy with Led Zeppelin for the full experience. \u2013Whiteside420\n\n\u00a0\nSome strains make you feel like you\u2019ve fulfilled your patriotic duty:\n\n\nSmoking weed is the most patriotic thing I've ever done. \u2013Meighan\n\n\u00a0\nThis strain is basically just a big ol\u2019 firework in your cerebrum:\n\n\nSenses lit up like the 4th of July. \u2013westcoastload\n\n\u00a0\nFor when you are overwhelmed with the love of cannabis and country:\n\n\nThe best strain I've ever smoked and the prettiest I've ever seen. God bless America. \u2013zonnes\n\n\u00a0\nHow toasty are you hoping to get? How baked? How cooked? Are you hungry yet?\n\n\nOkay I smoked a few bongs rips of this, and my girlfriend was completely toasted like the meatball sub at Subway. Honestly, roasted like a Jetpuffed Marshmallow. Seriously baked like an apple pie on July 4th, with fireworks blasting overhead. It was extremely patriotic. Entirely cooked. \u2013jamesm0792\n\n\u00a0\nPonder the big questions this Independence Day:\n\n\nI would recommend smoking this with some friends who want to talk about the universe or why exit signs are green in America and Red in Canada. \u2013dustrox\n\n\u00a0\nDo you want to feel like an American hero and get the girl? A lofty goal, but maybe this strain could help:\n\n\nHOLY SHIT, I feel like CAPTAIN AMERICA!!! Is that freedom I smell? Wow, what an amazing, intense high\u2026 Even the body effects make you feel like a superhero! Everything is heightened. Euphoric. Laid back, easy-going. Relaxed, but still alert and ready for action! Save the day and get the girl, hell yes!! Don't forget the victory party! Oh, and by the way, it's not paranoia that some of you are feeling a hint of. No my friends, that's you looking for any excuse to save the day. Ha! No negative side effects here! \u2013Cannadise\n\n\u00a0\nAnd last, but not least, if you can\u2019t find a patriotic strain, settle for one that will leave you feeling grand:\n\n\nIf you aren't able to find any of the patriotic ones during the 4th of July, then get this stuff to make the day grand. \u2013JohnnySativa420",

            "text": "Cannabis is a flower. And like flowers, cannabis exhibits strong, diverse odors that will stimulate your mind and elicit different sensations based on those smells (and, when smoked, flavors). These smell- and flavor-inducing chemicals are known as terpenes, which are representative of potential effects inside each unique flower. Linalool, for example, is a powerful terpene most commonly associated with lavender. It\u2019s known for its relaxing, sedative effects \u2014 the same thing people hope to inspire when they place a pouch of lavender under their pillows before bed.\n\nCannabis is a flower. Lavender is a flower. So what? Flowers smell like flowers.\nWait. Hold your horses, y\u2019all. Here\u2019s where it gets weird.\nOf all the terpenes, of which more than 200 are found in cannabis, many evoke smells that don\u2019t occur naturally in nature. Today, we are going to focus on a few terpenes near and dear to my heart (and stomach): CHEESE!\nThe \u201ccheesy\u201d terpenes are easily some of the most pungent and challenging. But the strains reward the adventurous palate with brilliant, uplifting effects that are pleasantly stimulating and luscious.\n\nSuch terpenes include octanoic acid, (methyl thio) butyrate, ethylmethyl acetic acid, hexanoic acid, isovaleric acid, and methyl mercaptan. These chemicals traverse the scale of cheesiness from the sweet, vanilla ice cream elements of Dairy Queen to the significantly cave-aged earthiness of OG Cheese and UK Cheese.\nBut cheese strains aren\u2019t exclusively savory. Like many fine cheese plates, fruit notes add a complementary sweetness to the umami qualities of a truly robust queso. Strains like Blueberry Cheesecake, Blue Cheese, Sweet Cheese, Bubble Cheese, and many more incorporate sweet elements that can bring creeping indica effects to this primarily sativa-hybrid family.\nCheese terpenes may not be the most pleasant to smell, but they are everywhere. Check out this quote by THCFarmer.com pertaining to one of the many cheese-like terpenes:\n\u201cIsovaleric Acid has a strong, pungent, sour, stinky feet, sweaty cheese smell. It is a major component of the cause of unpleasant foot odor. However, its volatile esters have pleasing scents and are used widely in perfumery. Used as a flavoring it is cheesy, dairy, sweet creamy, fermented, waxy and berry. It has shown effectiveness as an anticonvulsant and antidepressant.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t a recommendation to huff your stinky socks in an effort to conquer depression, but a simple illustration of the fine line between the refined and the repulsive. So go on: Grab a bowl, smile, and say, \u201ccheese!\u201d Looking for some options? Check the \u201ccheese\u201d filter in our strain explorer for some pungent options!",
