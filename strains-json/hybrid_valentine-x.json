            "text": "With Valentine\u2019s Day right around the corner, I was looking for a strain to fall in love with, but even after digging through all the local dispensary menus on the Leafly Finder, I still lacked inspiration. So, naturally I typed 'Valentine' into the Leafly Explorer and the first result was Valentine X. Having little knowledge of the strain and never experiencing it for myself, I contacted the breeder, Synergy Wellness, a California-based medical cannabis dispensary specializing in CBD strains and products.\nValentine X is a balanced hybrid, equal parts indica and sativa, bred for its medicinal properties. Synergy explained that Valentine X has the highest ratio of CBD:THC at 25:1. Valentine X is a select phenotype of ACDC that is closely related but selectively bred to enhance the CBD profile even further. Synergy even went as far as testing the terpene\u00a0characteristics and found that, while extremely similar, these two strains show minor variations in terpene concentrations.\n\nValentine X is named for St. Valentine, whose patronage, as you may know, includes love, engaged couples, and happy marriages. What you may not know is that St. Valentine is also the patron saint of\u00a0epilepsy, and with all of the appreciation for CBD\u2019s ability to limit seizures, especially in adolescents, this strain was dubbed Valentine X to reflect it medicinal properties.\nSynergy describes Valentine X as a very mellow and smooth strain that produces an immediate sense of calm. The Leafly community finds Valentine X to be relaxing,\u00a0euphoric, and happy, while sparking creativity\u00a0and sociability.\n\nThe earthy flavors of Valentine X are attributed to the amplified levels of myrcene, caryophyllene, and pinene found in its terpene profile. Myrcene has an invigorating aroma and is found in other plants like eucalyptus and lemongrass. It's also known to treat spasms, pain, and curb insomnia. Caryophyllene adds spice to mix, like that found in cloves and black pepper, and offers antiseptic, anti-tumor, and antibacterial properties. Pinene gives off sharp pine flavors and spark alertness and suppress asthma.\n\nUnfortunately, Valentine X isn\u2019t available in the Seattle market right now so I have yet to try it. Have you? If so, leave a review on the strain\u2019s detail page and use #MyLeaf to share your experience on social media.\nWhether you\u2019re single or taken, find some cannabis you love this weekend and have a Happy Valentine\u2019s Day!",

            "text": "Having heard this was akin to ACDC with a CBD to THC ratio of 25:1, I desperately wanted to find this.   A dispensary nearby finally started carrying it so I bought some.   I was so excited that I had found something like ACDC since I have a very low tolerance for THC and a negative reaction to even a moderate amount of it.  I was assured by the budmaster at the dispensary that this wouldn't get me high since it had so little THC and so much CBD.  \n  \nBoy, was THAT a LIE!   4 straight hours of paranoia,  muscle cramping, Sahara mouth (way beyond just \"dry\") and being VERY high.   I was absolutely miserable.  I use MMJ to combat chronic extreme pain.  The LAST thing I needed was my muscles tensing up and cramping up for 4 straight hours.   \n  \nI'm writing this as a WARNING to others.   Be careful.  Either I got bud from a freak high THC Valentine X plant or Valentine X isn't the 25:1 - CBD:THC ratio it's advertised as being.  \n  \nIf you don't like the psychological effects of Marijuana,  do not use this strain.   Stick to ACDC or Harle-tsu.  They'll give you the pain relief you're looking for without the additional \"high\".",
