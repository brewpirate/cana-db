After 10 years of smoking in southern california, Coast 2 Coast in Canoga Park is my pharmacy. I picked up and 8th of their beautiful valley girl og after finding out it was and SFV/Faceoff cross. Ive loved the intensity off Faceoff, but couldnt smoke it without inevitable anxiety if i hit a few too many, so I hoped the SFV would ease that. Oh boy did it. 3c farms are masterful growers with original cuts of the first OG kush from Josh D himself, and absolutely destroy the growing game with their phenos. upon smell it was citrus and pine, tingling the nostrils. The buds were trimmed perfectly(perfectly trimmed to the tip leaving the bottom headleafs which hold a lot of trichomes that many growers neglect) and had a perfect structure. Lime green with amber/orange hairs, covered in diamonds. It was dried and cured to a t, dry on the outside to pull apart without unnecessary moisture, yet had the ideal dampness in the center, breaking up into a perfect course but not dustry break. The smoke is my top 3 favorite. energetic but completely level and relaxing. try this strain!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/tAHHcVjF5EvieYWgrsxPA0WBCr8=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fRAbBXkNBSHOIMMxhio7k_wide-brim-red.png"},{"id":1633266,"username":"Fatphxguy","text":"if you have a High tolerance this is what you need.
