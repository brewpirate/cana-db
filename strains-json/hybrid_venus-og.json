It feels 60/40 sativa to me - decent lung expansion and great taste ... very much like lemons/oranges with just a hint of piney skunk.  The high starts quickly with a burst of euphoria and a warm blanket type feel on the body.  It can keep you focused and creative enough to do some late night work, but then puts you right to bed (just after the extreme munchies).  Nice thick orange-haired buds, look very \u0027kush\u0027 like but also with some of the random darker green patches that make you think this strain could have relatives from the Skunk family - particularly Lemon Skunk.  This is my go-to night time strain right now - just beware of those munchies!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1495960,"username":"gatahead30","text":"defiantly puts you in a good mood!! love the taste of it. kinda reminded me of a sweet tea with a lemon on the side!!!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3349","title":"New Strains Alert: Moondance, Venus OG, The Doctor, Shangri-La, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1456522800000)\/","text":"These strains were just added to the Leafly database and they\u0027re in some need of some user love.

Venus OG\n\nAnother member of the “planetary series,” Venus OG is a hybrid strain bearing OG Kush heritage, although its specific parent strains are disputed. Each glistening trichome carries a resemblance to the bright planet this strain is named after, coating its conic buds in a galactic blanket of white crystals. A fresh pine aroma mixed with sour notes of lemon draws you in, and next comes the heavy euphoria to take away your sense of gravity and lift you to a happy, relaxed place.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Venus OG\n \n   2. Moondance\n\nMoondance is a sativa-dominant strain that offers a CBD content as high as 11%. With an average THC level of just 4%, consumers will notice only minimal cerebral, euphoric sensations. Candied grape aromas turn to spicy pepper, fresh mint, and sharp pine flavors on the exhale. Stress, body aches, and painful inflammation wither away while the mind is left agile and clear, making this strain an excellent daytime choice for patients and those needing to stay active. Inheriting genetics from Super Silver Haze, Neville’s Haze, and an unknown CBD-rich parent, Moondance is a variation of the better-known MediHaze sativa.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Moondance\n \n   3. Purple Bud\n\nFrom Sensi Seeds comes the purple-blossomed indica Purple Bud, appropriately named for its bright hues of lavender. A descendant of Afghani indicas, this colorful plant offers large harvests of sparkling buds that carry the sweet and piney aroma of sandalwood. A distant sativa relative from Jamaica gives this strain a little added height and cerebral invigoration, but Purple Bud’s effects generally fall heavy on both mind and body. After crossing the Afghani indicas with a Jamaican sativa, Sensi Seeds added genetics from a Dutch Hindu Kush and a California Purple Kush.\n\n \n   4. Shangri-La\n\nTaking its name from the mythical valley utopia, the Shangri-La hybrid is sure to bring you to your own internal paradise. This 60/40 sativa-dominant strain takes you to a peaceful mindset where happiness and relaxation are no strangers. Patients might also choose this strain as an uplifting escape from nausea, stress, and pain. Skunky and sweet in flavor, Shangri-La boasts a garden of different aromas from ripe grape and berry to tropical mango and citrus. Bred by JinxProof Genetics and propagated by TGA Genetics, Shangri-La crosses parent strains Fudo Myo-o and 9 Pound Hammer.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Shangri-La\n \n   5. Sweet Jane\n\nSweet Jane is a sweet-flavored sativa strain that provides an uplifting burst of cerebral energy ideal for daytime use. A selected cut of the famous Island Sweet Skunk, Sweet Jane carries an intense fruity aroma with notes of grapefruit, lemon, and mangos. Colorful calyxes spiral from the buds, woven in fiery hairs and powdered in a sugary coat of crystal resin. With an average THC content of 20% and a subtle CBD profile, Sweet Jane delivers nuanced effects perfect for both relaxing and getting things done.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Sweet Jane\n \n   6. The Doctor\n\nBred by Green House Seeds, The Doctor is an indica-dominant strain designed to treat a myriad of unpleasant symptoms such as pain, nausea, appetite loss, and insomnia. Its name also comes in tribute to the motorcycle racer Valentino Rossi, also called “The Doctor.” Heavy sedating effects act fast, leaving you feeling pacified and calm. Earthy flavors soured by skunky, fruity notes arrive on the inhale, making their exit with the taste of hashy spice. Great White Shark, Super Skunk, and an unnamed South Indian parent lend The Doctor its genetic blueprint.\n\n \n   7. Purple Goat\n\nPurple Goat is a hybrid cross between Trainwreck and Blueberry Skunk, created by Oregon OMMP growers in the early 2010s. With a mostly sativa growth pattern, Purple Goat produces dense indica buds of a dark purple hue with a rich palate of sweet grass and spicy herbs. An early flowerer, Purple Goat will finish its maturation cycle by the end of September outdoors. When consumed, Purple Goat has an earthy taste with blueberry overtones and provides a feeling of deep relaxation.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Purple Goat\n \nBrowse through other new strains that were added recently to the Leafly Explorer or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12002247/new-strains-alert-moondance-venus-og-the-doctor-shangri-la-and-mo.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-moondance-venus-og-the-doctor-shangri-la-and-mo"}],"reviewCount":8,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":35.714285714285715},{"name":"Lemon","score":28.571428571428569},{"name":"Berry","score":7.1428571428571423},{"name":"Grape","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Orange","score":3.5714285714285712}],"effects":[{"name":"Focused","score":60.714285714285715},{"name":"Euphoric","score":42.857142857142861},{"name":"Happy","score":42.857142857142861},{"name":"Relaxed","score":42.857142857142861},{"name":"Uplifted","score":39.285714285714285}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":35.714285714285715},{"name":"Stress","score":35.714285714285715},{"name":"Headaches","score":28.571428571428569},{"name":"Inflammation","score":25},{"name":"Nausea","score":25}],"conditions":[{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":53.571428571428569},{"name":"Anxiety","score":32.142857142857139},{"name":"Asthma","score":25},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":25},{"name":"Migraines","score":25}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":3.5714285714285712}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/venus-og_100x100_2f53.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/566251/b/venus-og__primary_781d.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/venus-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.75/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
