            "text": "Verde Electric is a new type of Girl Scout Cookie. Similar to the Purple Cookie. But with more of a Cherry Pie/ Og/ Durban Poison mix that looks/ tastes amazing. I'm from the bay and know GSC. This hybrid is an overall balanced high that lasts a very long time and is close to the top of my list of buds. Unlike the Purple GSC, Verde Electric doesn't make you as thirsty. Love to medicate and socialize on it. No paranoia or fatigue. Wets the appetite and gets you a little thirsty.",

Cookie strains don't usually work for me.  \nIt has a really awesome head buzz, the kind of stoned feeling I'm usually after to treat my stress.\nI got a half gram of shatter by Canamo concentrates 74% THC (for an amazing deal, fifteen smackeroos tax incl.) \nI'm glad I got to try this strain in concentrate form it made it that much better. I'm actually sad I ran out. \nGreat for any time of the day, I can function if I wake and bake I can still function or if I'm kept up late and need something to help me sleep this works great",
