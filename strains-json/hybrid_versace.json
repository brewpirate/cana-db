            "text": "Brandon0571 speaks nothing but the truth; \"It's a truly magical strain\". This strain is sweet but thick and robust. It sets in with a clear head high that'll make everyone smile and eases into a mellow, balanced body high. This would definitely be a great strain if you were generally feeling down. The only \"negatives\" I'd give this strain would be a slight headache and maybe dry mouth but my eyes were never too terribly dry. I would recommend this strain to anyone struggling with anxiety or experiencing melancholia. All around SUPER TASTY and smooth strain for hanging out with friends or hanging around home base. \u270c\u270c",

Soon after I felt it spread through my body.  I'm relaxed, but I feel that I could still go out if I needed to. This strain is up there with GSC as a strain that makes me feel like me.",
