This strain is sweet but thick and robust. It sets in with a clear head high that\u0027ll make everyone smile and eases into a mellow, balanced body high. This would definitely be a great strain if you were generally feeling down. The only \"negatives\" I\u0027d give this strain would be a slight headache and maybe dry mouth but my eyes were never too terribly dry. I would recommend this strain to anyone struggling with anxiety or experiencing melancholia. All around SUPER TASTY and smooth strain for hanging out with friends or hanging around home base. ✌✌","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/tAHHcVjF5EvieYWgrsxPA0WBCr8=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fRAbBXkNBSHOIMMxhio7k_wide-brim-red.png"},{"id":1587486,"username":"BlackAdam52","text":"Just vaped a bowl of Versace in a dry herb vape. Any anxiety and depression that I had before my session was replaced with a good cerebral high. Soon after I felt it spread through my body.  I\u0027m relaxed, but I feel that I could still go out if I needed to. This strain is up there with GSC as a strain that makes me feel like me.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":16,"flavors":[{"name":"Lemon","score":30.555555555555557},{"name":"Sweet","score":29.166666666666664},{"name":"Flowery","score":17.361111111111111},{"name":"Diesel","score":13.888888888888888},{"name":"Pungent","score":13.194444444444443}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":91.666666666666657},{"name":"Happy","score":68.75},{"name":"Uplifted","score":61.111111111111114},{"name":"Focused","score":53.472222222222221},{"name":"Euphoric","score":47.222222222222229}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":80.555555555555557},{"name":"Stress","score":61.111111111111114},{"name":"Insomnia","score":27.083333333333332},{"name":"Fatigue","score":26.388888888888886},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":20.833333333333329}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":57.638888888888893},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":32.638888888888893},{"name":"Migraines","score":25},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":9.7222222222222214},{"name":"PTSD","score":4.1666666666666661}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":11.805555555555555},{"name":"Dizzy","score":7.6388888888888884},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":7.6388888888888884},{"name":"Headache","score":7.6388888888888884},{"name":"Paranoid","score":5.5555555555555554}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/versace_100x100_dac7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/581354/b/versace__primary_6890.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA","Detroit, MI","Oakland, CA","Santa Ana, CA","West Hollywood, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/versace","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.75/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Sour Diesel","subtitle":null,"slug":"sour-diesel","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/sour-diesel","symbol":"Sd","applink":"leafly://strain/sour-diesel"},{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"},{"name":"Granddaddy Purple","subtitle":null,"slug":"granddaddy-purple","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/granddaddy-purple","symbol":"Gdp","applink":"leafly://strain/granddaddy-purple"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
