They truly flourish in outdoor tropical climates, where they can grow over 6 feet, but indoors these plants will stay medium height and grow wide and branchy. Flowering usually occurs at 8 or 9 weeks. Though this hybrid tends to be sativa dominant, the long-lasting high is generally more cerebral with enough indica kick to ease tension. These energetic effects may not make Waldo a good choice for night time or those treating anxiety. Instead, Waldo\u0026rsquo;s spicy flowers might be the perfect addition to a sociable evening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","descriptionPlain":"Waldo was bred in the Netherlands by Apothecary Genetics, and perhaps because of this upbringing, these descendents of Pez and Purple Cherry do better in cooler climates than most.
