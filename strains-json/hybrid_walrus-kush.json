Upon first taste, many users may not feel the Walrus&rsquo;s effects; however, give it a few minutes and this strain will surprise you in ways you never thought possible. Perhaps slightly indica-dominant, Walrus Kush may not be the best medication for getting things done. Fairly well-balanced, it&rsquo;s a giggly and sociable strain while providing deep, body-relaxing effects at the same time. Great for users who suffer from stress or migraines, Walrus just might be worth a weekend trip to the dispensary.</p>\n",

            "text": "This bud is a creeper, and it is very, very potent. do not drive or operate heavy machinary after smoking. it takes about 45 minutes for the buzz to fully kick in, with a body stone that doesnt put you to sleep, and last a little over four hours. i actually got a slight amount of energy from this bud for the first few hours. unfortunatly the come down from this bud will knock you on your ass, which is why i didnt give it a higher rating. besides the harsh comedown this bud is a very pleasant smoke. it has a sweet citrus taste and a citrus/ diesel smell. the high put a smile on my face like white widow or good jack herrer. it was an extremely fun and enjoyable high. this bud made everything better and more fun to do. my appitite increased significantly and i ended up eating a whole apple pie by accident in addition to plenty of other food. i also found it difficult to stand when smoking this bud which was weird. it was overwhelming when i was smoking it towards the end of the blunt and i though i was gonna have a heart attack. i also felt like i weighed next to nothing. once i was able to raid the kitchen though i completely forgot my heart felt like it was about to jump out of my chest, even though i was still getting higher at the time. this bud is great for enhancing everything. it made everything a lot more fun. i would not recommend smoking it if you plan on accomplishing anything though.",
