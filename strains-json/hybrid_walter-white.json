            "text": "\u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25 Heisenberg would be proud. Walter White is an EXCEPTIONAL hybrid with a truly unique balance of flavors and a potent buzz to go with it. The aroma is that of a classic OG with an extra sharp piney smell and a sweet earthy undertone. Subtle citrus tones shine through as well. Beautifully frosted over with trichomes, this OG is definitely will please even the heaviest of tokers. This has quicky become one of my top 3 OGs! Tahoe Hydroponics did a wonderful things! b-Caryophyllene 4.1 mg/g, Limonene: 10 mg/g, Humulene 1.2 mg/g.",
