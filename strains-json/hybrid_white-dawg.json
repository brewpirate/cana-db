Though many plants and algae have developed trichomes of one type or another to trap insects or protect themselves against herbivores, when it comes to cannabis, trichomes have become one of the most coveted and used parts of the plant.\n\nWhy, you might ask? Trichomes are the primary source of terpenes and medicinal cannabinoids in the marijuana plant. Once buds are harvested and dried, these terpenes flake off into a light colored, sand-like substance known as kief.\nSince the highest concentration of vital cannabinoids like THC are found inside trichomes, it’s no wonder that growers continuously seek new strains and cultivation techniques that maximize the amount of trichomes on each bud. While grow environment drastically affects the amount of trichomes produced by any cannabis plant, some strains certainly produce more trichomes than others.\n\nTo help you find some strains that deliver the best kief, we’ve created this handy little list of 10 trichome-heavy strains.\n  Hash Plant\nCharacteristics of Hash Plant:\n\n90% indica\nBreeder: Sensi Seeds\nShort flowering time of 6-8
