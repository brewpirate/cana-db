            "text": "If there\u2019s one attribute that distinguishes cannabis from its plant-family counterparts, it\u2019s trichomes,\u00a0the tiny, sticky, white glandular hairs that cover the marijuana flower, giving it a \u201cfrosty\u201d appearance. Though many plants and algae have developed trichomes of one type or another to trap insects or protect themselves against herbivores, when it comes to cannabis, trichomes have become one of the most coveted and used parts of the plant.\n\nWhy, you might ask? Trichomes are the primary source of terpenes and medicinal cannabinoids in the marijuana plant. Once buds are harvested and dried, these terpenes flake off into a light colored, sand-like substance known as kief.\nSince the highest concentration of vital cannabinoids like THC are found inside trichomes, it\u2019s no wonder that growers continuously seek new strains and cultivation techniques that maximize the amount of trichomes on each bud. While grow environment drastically affects the amount of trichomes produced by any cannabis plant, some strains certainly produce more trichomes than others.\n\nTo help you find some\u00a0strains that deliver the best kief, we\u2019ve created this handy little list of 10 trichome-heavy strains.\n\u00a0 Hash Plant\nCharacteristics of Hash Plant:\n\n90% indica\nBreeder: Sensi Seeds\nShort flowering time of 6-8 weeks\n\n\u00a0 G13\nCharacteristics of G13:\n\nIndica\nIndoor flowering time of 8-10 weeks\n\n\u00a0 White Widow\nCharacteristics of White Widow:\n\n50/50 hybrid\nBreeder: Green House Seeds\nIndoor flowering time of 8-10 weeks\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Chemdawg\nCharacteristics of Chemdawg:\n\nHybrid with both sativa and indica phenotypes\nIndoor flowering time of around 8 weeks\n\n\u00a0 OG Kush\nCharacteristics of OG Kush:\n\nHybrid\nIndoor flowering time of 8-9 weeks\n\n\u00a0 White Dawg\nCharacteristics of White Dawg:\n\nIndica hybrid\nIndoor flowering time of 8-10 weeks\n\n\u00a0 Chernobyl\nCharacteristics of Chernobyl:\n\nSativa-dominant hybrid\nBreeder: TGA Seeds\nFlowering time between 8-9 weeks\n\n\u00a0 Sour Diesel\nCharacteristics of Sour Diesel:\n\nSativa\nFlowering time of 10-11 weeks\n\n\u00a0 Hashberry\nCharacteristics of Hashberry:\n\nIndica-dominant hybrid\nBreeder: Mandala Seeds\nFlowering time of 7-9 weeks\n\n\u00a0 Sharksbreath\nCharacteristics of Sharksbreath:\n\nIndica-dominant hybrid\nBreeder: DNA Genetics\nFlowering time of around 9 weeks\n\nPhoto credit: Nickel Bag of Funk via photopin cc",
