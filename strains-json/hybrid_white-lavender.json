You\u0027ll be smiling and laughing...a lot.  Sativa dominant for sure.  Probably best as a morning strain, although I tried it for the first time at 6:00 pm.  It\u0027s going to be a late night.....of fun.  This would be a nice strain for your friends who are not so experienced with weed.  No paranoia, just happiness and laughter....and very wide open eyes.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"},{"id":1619070,"username":"ToastedPineapple80","text":"I love the white widow, \nSativa and the lavender indica effects added. \nFocused, happy and relaxed.
