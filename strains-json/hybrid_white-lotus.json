The reasoning behind my favoring this strain is because of what it does to your body physically if you take it before you sleep it will actually begin to heal parts of your body!!! I have never had any kind of healing experience with other strains except Blueberry for the mind and God Bud for the body (those are my other two favorite strains) and so it is my belief that this strain MUST become popularized all over Washington State so that others can begin to gain something from taking up!",
