I kept trying to get this strain on here but I guess this is close? a very good 50/50 hybrid. the most fruity smelling herb I've grown or smoked. smells like strawberries and cream when flowering. clones very easily, great all day smoke. one of my favorite hybrids I've tried from strain hunters. I will keep growing and smoke this one, and recommend it to anyone that loves a nice well rounded medicine.",
