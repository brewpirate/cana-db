I was looking for a supermom strain that would make me clean the house in a single bound but this strain is a little too euphoric for being productive.  I can't keep trucking with my chores.  I'm like a magpie looking for something shiny and getting obsessed with music and tiny details...  This strain would be amazing for concerts and hanging out with friends around a campfire when you don't want to be sedated but you don't have to be productive for a while.  Also has all off the trip of a sativa but none of the anxiety.  A little couch lock.  Also, feeling kinda sexy...  hmmm...  Yeah.  it's good. ;)",
