I\u0027ve had to smoke this about 10 times to really decide if I liked it or not.  Here\u0027s the deal... I was looking for a supermom strain that would make me clean the house in a single bound but this strain is a little too euphoric for being productive.  I can\u0027t keep trucking with my chores.  I\u0027m like a magpie looking for something shiny and getting obsessed with music and tiny details...  This strain would be amazing for concerts and hanging out with friends around a campfire when you don\u0027t want to be sedated but you don\u0027t have to be productive for a while.  Also has all off the trip of a sativa but none of the anxiety.  A little couch lock.  Also, feeling kinda sexy...  hmmm...  Yeah.  it\u0027s good. ;)","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1385392,"username":"ddigitalbathh","text":"Vaped almost two full bowls with very little result.
