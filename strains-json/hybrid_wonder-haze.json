            "text": "Wonder Haze: Super Silver Haze X Williams Wonder - 70% sativa, 30% indica.\r\n\r\nA slow creeper, takes about 10-mins to come on, reaching full strength after about 25 mins.\r\n\r\nBuzz lasted about 70 minutes.\r\n\r\nSmell: buds smell skunky with a pine disinfectant type smell like cleaning fluid - not unpleasant though.\r\n\r\nSmokes smoothly as a joint.\r\n\r\nHigh: (head) A cerebral high with slight numbness around eyes, cheeks and temple areas. Euphoric, uplifting and lazy-feeling. Not as strong as something like Bubble Gum and the high lasts about half as long as Bubble Gum.\r\nHigh: (body) Relaxing and lazy, without being too couch-locky. Slight body tingling.\r\n\r\nGood to listen to music to.",

I have smoked many different stuff since then but this one is special for me. I am Hybrid love and this gives you the perfect balance of a Sativa energy with a hint of indica at the end to relax. Absolutely top 5 in my book.",
