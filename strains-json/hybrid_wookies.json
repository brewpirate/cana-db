            "text": "This strain is awesome. A buddy of mine gifted me a few babies out of what he had and I was able to grow a few last year. It was an organic grow and I ended up with an average yield, but the smoke was great and after a week long cure was very, very smooth. It has an earthy, woody aroma and great flavor. Nice mellow (as in mood, not intensity) high. If I get it again I will probably keep a mother for personal and to share with friends. This one is in my top 5, and I know a few people that feel the same way.\nFYI I'm a medical user. Bipolar 2, ADD/ADHD, anxiety, insomnia, etc. This strain works well for my symptoms and I would recommend it to another patient. May not help you the same, but it helped me a great deal.",
