    "description": "<p>WTF by White Tygh Farms is an odd cross of CBD-dominant genetics that sprouted a THC-dominant flower. Naturally, White Tygh Farms exclaimed, &ldquo;WTF!&rdquo; and thus the strain was born.

Master grower Cole Fritcher had difficulty describing the aroma, but articulated its oddity and uniqueness with pride. Think Tang powder sweetened with essence of blueberries and composted earth. WTF hits mid-level in terms of potency while helping to soothe anxiety and minor physical pain.&nbsp;</p>\n",

            "text": "Possibly one of my favorite strains in my book. This strain is psychoactive, almost making me feel like the time I tried psychedelics. It disintegrated my sense of self to a point where I was just a being, something similar to that feeling but it technically just mellows you out due to the insane amounts of THC in it. It's highly psychoactive when taken in large amounts, so don't try it when working or driving. Very strong and the high lasts long too. Hope I could get my hands on these again in the future.",
