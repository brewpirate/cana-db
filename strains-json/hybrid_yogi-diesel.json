Stays true to the diesel flavor, and the color being an ambient light green with visible trichomes and hairs all over. The texture isn\u0027t too sticky, but the high feels like it should be. Really the only negative I\u0027ve noticed so far is above average cotton mouth and dry throat. Make sure you have a beverage on hand and enjoy this solid strain!
