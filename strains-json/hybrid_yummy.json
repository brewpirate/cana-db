It\u0027s a perfect amount of relaxation combined with euphoria and still pockets of energy. In my opinion, this is what a hybrid should feel like. I don\u0027t get too fuzzy on this strain either, so I can still hang out, get work done and carry decent conversations. If I was stuck on a deserted island and could only have one strain for the rest of my life, this would be it.
