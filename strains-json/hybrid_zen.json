It was the first jar the budtender pulled out, and I immediately decided to grab an eighth. I smoked it out of a paper plane rolled by yours truly. Instantly upon inhalation, i felt incredible expansion, and a warm easing sensation encasing my bowels. Having been suffering from morning nausea for quite sometime, this strain is a miracle worker among indica dominant hybrids. If anyone ever feels sick to their stomach, or just wants a new-gen diamond among strains, try and find yourself some zen",
