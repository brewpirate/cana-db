            "text": "Not what I expected (in a good sense).  I'm a senior getting back into this after 40 years of Mormon life. I have a Pax 1 pocket vape unit, and looks like a cell phone from 20 feet away.  This is my first Indica after testing a dozen different Sativas over the last 6 months. I got this at a dispensary in Bend Oregon, called Oregrown.   I asked the budtender for his recommendation for a good migraine relief strain.  Without even saying anything, his eyes twinkled and he reached under the counter and pulled out a 1.75 gram, nicely-labeled jar of \"Indo Optimus Prime, 21.5% THC\".  A few weeks later, having not experienced a migraine for testing, decided what the heck, why not test it out.  It was a day, I had absolutely nothing going.  If this hit me like what I have been told to expect from an Indica, I should be relaxed, mellow, maybe couch locked.  If so, no big deal.  Turns out, and here comes the unexpected...  I half fill my Pax oven with maybe a quarter gram of finger-crunched buds out of the bottle.  I put my bent pipe screen in to make the load tight.  I fire it up, get the green light and take 4 good, relaxed tokes and I start feeling it already.  I take one more and turn it off  and go into the real world for a test drive.  I put on my nice over-ear headphones with the playlist I call \"Euphoria\" blasting.  I then go for a 5 mile walk, half of which I jog for the first time in 10 years.  I'm barely out of breath.  I get back and wash all the exterior windows of my entire house.  I then clean my garage including doing stuff I've been procrastinating for 3 years.  So, to be clear, I took 5 tokes of this and four hours later, my whole goddamn honey-do list for a fuckin month was done and I was dancin half the time.   I  would imagine, if I did have a migraine this sure enough would have taken my mind off it.  I get why the budtender at Oregrown in Bend had a twinkle in his eye.  This strain feels very much like I remember the feeling when I was a young man.  After one time around the block,  I'd call Optimus Prime a real live, performance enhancing drug.  I've now been writing reviews and facebook and shit for three more hours.  Jesus!",

I'm not the smoker I used to be and not a fan of getting super baked anymore. this strain will keep you pretty clear headed but super relaxed. the body high is incredible and if you need sleep it'll keep you asleep. I don't think I'll ever get bored of it. if you haven't tried this strain I really recommend it.",
