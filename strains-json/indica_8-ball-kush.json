            "text": "Our five newest varieties bring the Leafly Explorer to the cusp of 800 strains, and it\u2019s times like these we realize that building this database is an endless endeavor. Indica enthusiasts will love 8 Ball Kush, a 100% indica strain descended from a native Afghani landrace strain. Hell\u2019s OG (f.k.a. Hell\u2019s Angel OG) is an indica-dominant hybrid rumored to originate in the gardens of the ol\u2019 Red & Whites themselves. For our devoted sativa consumers, we added two uplifting hybrids: Dream Star and Orange Diesel. Smelliot is our new hybrid cross between Abusive OG and NYC Diesel, with a pungent aroma that immediately justifies this strain\u2019s name.\nIf you\u2019ve tried one of these, don\u2019t hold out on us: leave a review sharing your experience so the rest of us can live vicariously through you.\n\u00a0\u00a01. 8 Ball Kush\nCharacteristics of 8 Ball Kush:\n\nPure indica strain\nDescended from an Afghani landrace strain\nBreeder: Barney\u2019s Farm\nEarthy and spicy aroma\nMore cerebrally stimulating than the average indica\nIndoor flowering time of 50 to 60 days\n\n\u00a0\u00a02.
