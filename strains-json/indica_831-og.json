If the sole sensation of \u201ccouch lock\u201d was created into a strain of cannabis, this would be it. It smells beautiful. Honestly one of the best smelling strains I\u2019ve ever had. Gave me the munchies OD. So good on the body. I\u2019m so tired, I can\u2019t wait to take this nap. 5/5. A hitter. ",
