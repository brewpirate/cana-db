            "text": "This strain was obtained by Tweed\n\nTo start, this is a green house (sun-grown) strain so it's buds look different off the back. We will include picture late hopefully. The buds look dark green, but they look like the typical \"weed you got from the guy down the street\" kind of weed. It looks home grown, but if done well. \n\nThe smell is sort of a sweet but musky smell, which doesn't overfill your space with the smell. It's also a very well cured bud, which Tweed holds that standard, but we've experience dry bud before. \n\nThe smoke isn't harsh, which is good because sometimes it can be a little hashy I've found. The smoke also isn't too smelly either, so easy to mask which is important!\n\nThe high took about 10 minutes to kick in, which is actually weird because usually it hits in right away or second later. It was a creeper high, but it was a surprising head high at first. Behind the eyes and cerebral around the back of the head tingled. It was a calming and soon body calming feel. It was almost soothing for sore muscles, but more of the hybrid feeling so not overly strong. \n\nThere wasn't any negative effects, but maybe munchies. Most indicas are Manchy strains, but this one was one that you knew it would be. \n\nAll around we gave it a 5/5 and if you see it in the future or at Tweed, maybe get some?",
