I put flowers buds in a coffee grinder and grind into powder. I heat water to boil and put about a T. or less in tea ball or paper teabag, to equal parts of half n half cream and boiling water, (as THC is not water soluble) I add  2 T. of spiced Mystic Chai tea powder. (Large can available at Sam's Club)  I stir and cover my cup with foil to let the ingredients steep; about 15-20 min. or longer \"the longer I let sit ; the stronger it becomes. I feel my ears warm up and a euphoria feeling about within 20-30 minutes This really helps my pain and allows me to sleep. I hope this helps others who can not smoke. ",

Both 7 weeks of flowering,  TGA. Thought their Jack the Ripper was the fastest but it's a 8 week job.  See if you can add his F-13 to your inventory, the man is a breeding legend so I expect his latest will be given its proper place in  the world of cannabis.",
