On the contrary, it has opened my mind somehow, allowing a free-flow of thought, a dam-bursting shot of THC first thing in the morning, and here I am, sharing this adventure with you.\nAce Killer Og is fine medicine.  It is a powerful tool to be used wisely, for it is a powerful gift from the Cannabis Gods to open your mind.\nHave fun, enjoy the sun, and let it be known, 5 Stars for the Ace Killer Og.",
