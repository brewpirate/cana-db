    "description": "<p>Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA Subcool Seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style. A crossbreed of <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/indica/black-cherry-soda\">Black Cherry Soda</a> and <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a>, this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavors. Ace of Spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall. Flowering occurs at 8 weeks and they are generally large and heavy. These buds are pretty to look at with a range of colors that can include purples, blues, and pinks all coated in orange hairs.</p>\n",

After those bong rips I finished some work I was putting off until the morning & got some writing done. Relaxed my back while I sat at my desk writing this, writing my book  and doing my work. When I got up after 3 hours with little to no back pain & was ready for bed. Nice sound sleep. Excellent color, aroma,& taste.",
