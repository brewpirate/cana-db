It retains the shape of Big Bud (each bud is incredibly dense at about 2-3 grams apiece), but it keeps the taste of the Afghan.  For me, it comes on relatively quickly, but doesn't stay for more than an hour and a half, during which my mood was quite incredibly turned around, and I was, for lack of better words, just in a happy mood.  Music was nice, as was nature, but the best part about this strain is the euphoria you get from it.  Definitely worth a try :)",

Definitely a nighttime strain, smacks you in the face and all you want to do after this strain wears off is sleep. I would recommend if looking for a euphoric, couch lock high",
