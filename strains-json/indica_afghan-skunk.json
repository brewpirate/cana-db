Afghan Skunk quickly spread to Amsterdam and beyond and is now considered one of the &ldquo;classics.&rdquo; Its resilient Skunk genes make this plant a popular recommendation for new growers, and its legendary high yields make it a favorite all around. Flowering happens around 8 weeks and the buds will have a menthol smell combined with the &ldquo;sweet stink&rdquo; skunks are known for.

It also helped me a lot to take away my headache and stress from work. I would say it felt more like an hybrid to me. Perfect to smoke right after work to get a little kick, but not meanwhile cause I couldn't concentrate at all ! Very good weed overall for a good price ( 35usd/oz) in Mexico.",
