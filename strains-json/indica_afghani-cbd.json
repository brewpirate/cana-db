            "text": "This was the second strain I have ever tried, since I'm a new medical patient due to a back injury and nerve pain. \n\nThere was no high feeling at all from this strain, just a sense of calm and relaxation. It is a lot like Cannatonic yet it leaves me with less of the very sleepy feelings that Cannatonic gave me. It reduces inflammation very quickly, so it helps remove a source of my pain but it doesn't get rid of the pain completely. It allows me to be pain free while in a resting position where I would otherwise always be in pain. If I overstretch or bend a certain way, I will still notice some pain. It also helps with GI issues.\n\nThe smell of the bud is an intense blueberry/grape high note with a low early spring floral pine note. I'd recommend this to any medical patient, especially people who are new to cannabis, seeking anti-inflammatory properties and a nice calming effect.",

            "text": "I am currently smoking on a batch of CBD afghani from my dispensary green rhino .. i think it's fire . I have DP/DR as well as anxiety and PTSD , i can not handle high THC strains any more . I immediately felt healing properties with my first pull off this batch . The smell is very clean , fresh , strong and has great cannabis pheromones coming off it . I feel my mind relax as well i am getting caught in thoughts from time to time as well . I feel calm , sleepy , comfy and i have some what of a dry mouth after a couple more tears off the glass piece . Clear mind with a fuzzy focus , tending 1 special task is great on this . I have no heavy eyes , just some warmth , light body , light but slightly heavy head depending how much is consumed - how tired you become . I feel a new fullness in my head , this might work for head aches ! great any time smoke but better at night or during a good amount of time you have free to relax . I would not have much sex on this but would love to have sensual oral  . Overall great strain and plant!",
