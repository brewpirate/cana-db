Normal \"couchlock\" indicas seem to have very little sedative effect on me, but this Afghani stuff has managed to actually WORK :).  All most of the other ones did was get me high and make me even more awake.  Not Afghani.  Took about a tenth of a gram 20 minutes ago and I\u0027m feeling like I will be able to sleep tonight.  No big, destracting \"high\", either.  Very clear-headed and lucid.  You feel that it is there, and it is intense in it\u0027s own way, but again, incredibly lucid and not scatterbrained at all.  Perfect for studying.  Highly focused.\r\nThe body effects, however, are QUITE strong :).  I feel physically somewhat drunk, but in a pleasant way - no pukiness, impaired judgement or any malaise whatsoever like you\u0027d get with alchohol, but extremely lazy, a bit sleepy, coordination is a little off, eyes are droopy as hell.  Very mild tingling sensations - woah, a body buzz...cool :).   I\u0027m someone that can smoke just about any other indica dominant strain and get almost no body buzz at all, yet am quite sensitive to the mind-altering effects.  Afghani is a perfect match for me.  I\u0027m ready to get some sleep and there\u0027s no craziness going on in my head.  No trippiness.  No anxiety whatsoever.

Check out all the other newly added strains in our Explorer and leave a review for those that you\u0027ve tried!\n \n   1. God\u0027s Green Crack\n\nGod’s Green Crack is a balanced hybrid strain bred by Jordan of the Islands, who wanted to lighten up the heavy effects of God’s Gift with a high-flying Green Crack sativa. The indica and sativa parents work together to deliver a duality of head and body effects that lift the mood while relaxing muscles. Its buds take on a deep purple coloration toward the end of its maturation, especially when raised in lower temperatures.\n\n \n   2. Hawaiian Dream\n\nHawaiian Dream is an uplifting sativa strain that crosses Blue Dream with a Hawaiian variety. Though some renditions of this strain have a THC-dominant chemical profile, Hawaiian Dream is best known for its high CBD content which is often twice as abundant as its THC. Patients look to this high-CBD sativa to remedy pain, inflammation, and anxiety without physical heaviness or a foggy head.\n\n \n   3. Maui Bubble Gift\n\nMaui Bubble Gift is an indica-dominant hybrid strain whose known parent strains include Bubble Gum and a Maui Waui/God’s Gift hybrid. This strain’s CBD content often outweighs its THC levels, making it a great match for consumers with pain, anxiety, and inflammation. With only mildly psychoactive effects, Maui Bubble Gift delivers its soothing relief alongside an earthy, floral aroma.\n\n \n   4. Blue Afghani\n\nBred by Jordan of the Islands in Canada, Blue Afghani is an indica-dominant strain that combines genetics from Blueberry and Afghani. Its stout plants produce dense, resinous buds that fill your nose with a sweet and spicy berry aroma. Next come the powerful full-body effects that keep you anchored in relaxation while pain, anxiety, and stress float away.\n\n \n   5. Predator Pink\n\nA cross between Plushberry and Starfighter, Predator Pink by Exotic Genetix is a 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid with a tropical candy flavor. Though less common than its green counterpart, some phenotypes express themselves in pastel pink and fuchsia hues. Beginning with a lift of the spirit and buzzing cerebral energy, Predator Pink’s effects eventually make their descent into meditative relaxation.\n\n \n   6. Mother of Berries\n\nMother of Berries, or M.O.B., is an indica strain from Maine that provides a deeply relaxing experience that transitions well into restful sleep. Carrying the legacy of its Blueberry parent, Mother of Berries lives up to its name with its unmistakable blueberry fragrance. Its chunky buds are wreathed in interweaving hues of purple and green, which are obscured under a dense blanket of crystal trichomes. With effects that are more mellow than jarring, Mother of Berries is suitable for both novice and seasoned consumers alike.\n\n \n   7. Eugene Cream\n\nEugene Cream is an indica-dominant strain grown by Drift Away Farm. Named for its light color and smooth smoke, Eugene Cream inherits its characteristics from a Hash Plant/Big Bud hybrid and a female plant called Queen. Several years of selective breeding gave rise to the stable phenotype that now circulates the Oregon market.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/12002152/new-strains-alert-hawaiian-dream-blue-afghani-maui-bubble-gift-go.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-hawaiian-dream-blue-afghani-maui-bubble-gift-go"},{"id":"contentitems-3247","title":"New Strains Alert: CBD Shark, Afghan Hawaiian, 13 Dawgs, Damn Sour, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1424624400000)\/","text":"The Leafly strain database now exceeds 1,200 varieties, but our collection is far from finished.
