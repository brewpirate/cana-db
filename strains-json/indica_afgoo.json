The strain produces bushy, short plants ideal for small spaces.\nFlowering Time: 8 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Prefers a Mediterranean climate with temperatures between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Afgoo should be able to tolerate slightly higher humidity levels.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Afgoo can be raised indoors or outdoors. Make sure the plants get good airflow while growing outdoors if higher humidity levels are present.\nFeeding: Breeders at Green House Seeds state that Afgoo can take higher feeding levels than most strains.
