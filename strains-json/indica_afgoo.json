            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Afgoo, also known as Afgooey, is a classic indica strain that has been around for years. Made available by Green House Seeds, this strain is a cross between an Afghani landrace and Maui Haze. Its sedating effects are delivered alongside a fresh pine aroma that leaves you feeling euphoric and centered.\nGrow Techniques: Afgoo will grow successfully either indoors or outdoors. The breeders at Green House Seeds state that any medium will allow this plant to flourish. They do recommend exploring SOG (sea of green) or SCROG (screen of green) methods to increase the yield. The strain produces bushy, short plants ideal for small spaces.\nFlowering Time: 8 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Prefers a Mediterranean climate with temperatures between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Afgoo should be able to tolerate slightly higher humidity levels.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Afgoo can be raised indoors or outdoors. Make sure the plants get good airflow while growing outdoors if higher humidity levels are present.\nFeeding: Breeders at Green House Seeds state that Afgoo can take higher feeding levels than most strains. Keep the nutrients up and push your garden towards a massive yield of quality cannabis.",
