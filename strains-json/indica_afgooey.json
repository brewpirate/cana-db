            "text": "Dating back to the 18th century, bluegrass sits at the intersection of traditional Scottish, Irish, and English folk music. Settlers brought their ballads, dance music, and fiddles to the Appalachian Mountains in North America, where their individual melodies mixed together to create an uplifting sound that has been passed down from musician to musician for generations.\n\nBluegrass may be a cousin to folk, traditional, and Americana music, but at its heart it exists as one of the most distinct and noteworthy individual genres of our time. It is music that weaves stories and moves the soul\u2014it\u2019s a rich and colorful genre that can excite and invigorate the senses, especially with a little cannabis nearby.\nBelow, explore five bluegrass bands with your favorite pre-roll\u00a0in hand\u2014preferably on a rocking chair, soaking in the soulful tunes.\nLaws of Gravity by The Infamous Stringdusters\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Tangilope\nThe Infamous Stringdusters\u2019 latest album, Laws of Gravity, wastes no time as it bursts into life with their first track, \u201cFreedom,\u201d instantly immersing listeners in a rich and invigorating sound. The album, released this year, packs a powerful punch that is vibrant, complex and uniquely its own.\nLaws of Gravity manages to encapsulate the traditions of bluegrass while merging it with modern grooves and instrumentation. The bright movements of Jeremy Garrett\u2019s fiddle and Chris Pandolfi\u2019s banjo sing across the soundscape of bass, dobro, and guitar for a symphony that shines with and without the engaging and lively lyrics.\nWhen the lyrics do fade away, listeners enjoy the intricate improvisational jamming that is a hallmark of The Infamous Stringdusters. Laws of Gravity has a life of its own that proves once again why the band continues to be a resounding favorite across the genre\u2019s fanbase.\nThe Muscle Shoals Recordings by The Steeldrivers\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Blueberry Headband\nThe Muscle Shoals Recordings starts with light, happy banjo on the track \u201cLong Way Down,\u201d setting the tone for an album that combines the essence of bluegrass with rich complexity. Gary Nichols\u2019 distinct and powerful voice, often accompanied by beautiful backing vocals, cruises effortlessly across the instrumentation and inspires with its authenticity and depth.\nThe Steeldrivers feature banjo, mandolin, guitar, bass, and fiddle for a full and delightfully classic bluegrass feel. The Muscle Shoals Recordings, produced in 2015, is the band\u2019s fourth album and earned them a Grammy in the Best Bluegrass category.\nFrom the first track to the last, this is a spirited album that uplifts the mind and moves the body with energetic sound.\n\nThief by Keller & The Keels\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lodi Dodi\nWith a distinctly joyful beat, Thief picks you up and whisks you off into a dance of folky bluegrass with Keller William\u2019s playful vocals leading the way. Williams is joined by Jenny Keel on upright bass and flat picker Larry Keel. Together, the three bring a decidedly full sound to their latest acoustic album.\nKeller & The Keels have never shied away from creative covers, and Thief, released in 2010, is no exception. Unlike their first album, Grass (released in 2006), Thief does not feature any original songs, focusing solely on covers. The album\u2019s title is an ode to this decision.\nBluegrass versions of Amy Winehouse\u2019s \u201cRehab\u201d and Marcy Playground\u2019s \u201cSex and Candy\u201d are among the familiar but undeniably fresh covers. The tracks allow the listener to immediately jump in and sing along while still being immersed in new tunes and feelings.\nWilliams\u2019 knack for composing solo music lends expertise to the composition of his trio, and as such,\u00a0Thief has an intricacy that is impressive for such a small acoustic group.\nFriends of Fall by Crooked Still\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lemon Drop\nCrooked Still offers a unique bluegrass element that is light, airy, and melodic. Lead singer Aoife O\u2019Donovan\u2019s voice carries across the backdrop of banjo, bass, cello, and fiddle like a shooting star.\nFriends of Fall, released in 2011, brings an ethereal beauty and complexity to the genre of bluegrass. Songs such as \u201cPretty Bird\u201d will stir emotion, while \u201cIt\u2019ll End Too Soon\u201d inspires and invigorates. Often described as \u2018progressive bluegrass\u2019 due to innovative acoustics, Crooked Still\u2019s high-energy sound encourages engagement from the first note to the last thanks to its unique instrumentation.\nFriends of Fall is refreshing and wholly uplifting, carrying the spirit of bluegrass as it soars to new and delightful heights.\n\nLove. Ain\u2019t Love \u00a0by Yonder Mountain String Band\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Afgooey\nLove. Ain\u2019t Love, released this year, is the latest from Yonder Mountain String Band, encompassing a full thirteen tracks of rich and engaging rhythms that will keep you on your toes.\nFeaturing five band members on banjo, bass, fiddle, guitar, and mandolin, Yonder Mountain String Band also has the distinction of all five members acting as vocalists, which allows them to create beautifully layered and rich harmonies.\nOn the other hand, Love. Ain\u2019t Love does not shy away from fully instrumental tracks, such as \u201cFall Outta Line,\u201d which showcases the band\u2019s innovation in its tune. This ability to embrace the full merits of their instrumentation has won YMSB fans across various genres, including those in the jam band scene. When listening to Love. Ain\u2019t Love, one can get lost in the music as it paints stories with and without lyrics.\nLove. Ain\u2019t Love provides a playful, energetic, and creative soundscape. The passion and vibrancy in every note of the album act as joyful reminders that Yonder Mountain String Band continues to inspire and be inspired by bluegrass, even 18 years after the release of their first album.",

            "text": "To make a truly informed cannabis-buying decision, you have to smell the product. And I don\u2019t mean taking a dainty whiff. You\u2019ve got get in there and really inhale, because smelling it \u2014 really focusing on the fragrance \u2014 may just be the best way to choose your cannabis.\n\u201cDepending on what the scent is, it can make or break a strain for people,\u201d said Tyson Dieter, a manager at the Southwest Portland outlet of Nectar, an Oregon cannabis retailer.\nI\u2019m a home perfumer trained by a world-class nose. Years ago I trained at home using natural perfumer Mandy Aftel\u2019s workbooks, and later I studied with her at her studio in Berkeley, Calif. For me scent is the ultimate in pleasure experiences. On a recent Tuesday morning, I stopped in at Nectar to talk scent and learn about the role it plays in the burgeoning cannabis industry.\nWhat Do Cannabis and Perfumes Have in Common?\nIt turns out perfume and pot have a lot in common.\nBoth products come with outlandish, sometimes arbitrary titles. Burberry Weekend, meet Blackberry Kush. Practically no one buys the product without smelling it first. (Where it\u2019s allowed, that is. In Washington state, pre-purchase smelling for recreational cannabis is against the law.) We don\u2019t talk about them using the same language, although that\u2019s changing as consumers learn more about scent\u2019s connection to the cannabis experience.\n\nAs I stepped through Nectar\u2019s front door, the first thing I noticed was the air, which smelled lightly of sweet herb. The employees \u2014 perhaps the happiest service professionals I\u2019ve ever encountered \u2014 were all eager to talk to me about their favorite-smelling strains.\nCommercial perfumes are composed of top notes, middle notes (also called heart notes) and base notes, so named based on their relative evaporation rates. A perfume with a top note of essential oil of bergamot (citrus) might be paired with a middle note of lavender oil and a base note of thick, resiny oakmoss. Together they make up the full scent experience of the perfume.\nIn the cannabis world, the language hasn\u2019t yet evolved to describe the plant\u2019s fragrance notes with such specificity. But budtenders and growers are expanding their vocabulary to describe the scent experience. So you may see two main, often contrasting odors: sweet and fruity paired with earthy, like in an Afgooey.\nAt Nectar the jars open dozens of times a day for olfactory sampling. Some strains are more fragrant than others. A Blackberry Kush may not remind anyone of blackberries, but it does have a subtle sweetness to balance the hashy, diesel-fume center it\u2019s known for. GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), another potent strain, smells oily and pungent in the middle and slightly sweet on top.\nAll cannabis strains carry their own scent signature, a fact that often surprises cannabis consumers who come to a shop for the first time.\n\n\u201cFirst-timers generally know about THC content and little else,\u201d Dieter said. \u201cBut then they usually stand there smelling all day to find a perfect match.\u201d\nSome strains share some of their scent identity with the world of aromatherapy. An activating hybrid sativa like Orange Crush has much in common with a bitter orange essential oil \u2014 one often used by aromatherapists for energizing. In the same vein, the citrus-scented J1, a sativa hybrid, smells like a traditional foug\u00e8re-style perfume, opening with a citrus note and moving into an herby heart.\nBecause scent is deeply personal, no one really agrees on which strains smell best. A savory, cheesy strain like OG99 might send some running for the hills, but for consumers who like to \u201csmoke savory,\u201d the associated mellow vibe is well worth it.\nOther consumers prefer the so-called \u201cauthentic-smelling\u201d pot strains. For them, something like The Perps, which gives off the odor of a grape Jolly Rancher, might feel like spraying your face with Britney Spears\u2019 Curious.\nWhy Consumption Methods Matter When It Comes to Scent Preservation\nWhen it comes to harnessing the scent of cannabis, consumption methods matter.\n\nA cannabis flower\u2019s scent comes directly from its terpenes, volatile aromatic organic compounds found in the oils of all flowers. Terpenes in the cannabis flower evolved to attract pollinators or repel enemies. More than 100 possible terpenes are thought to exist in various strains of the cannabis flower.\nThe unique combination of terpenes in a particular strain produces its aromatic properties and, some believe, is thought to influence the body\u2019s high. To heighten the experience of the terpenes, therefore, consumers should reach for consumption methods involving less combustion. The higher the burn temperature, the more likely the most volatile and aromatic terpenes will combust before being consumed.\nIn other words, to get the full scent experience, vape it, don\u2019t smoke it.\n\u201cWhen you have a vaping machine, it can hinder the effect of the flavor,\u201d said Myles Hyde, a budtender at Nectar who specializes in medicinal use. For flower, Hyde suggested using a vaporizer in at least the $250 range. \u201cWith a lower-quality machine, you may end up smelling some of the machine itself.\u201d\n\nThose who do want to smoke it would be advised to do it indoors, according to Hyde, where the scent lingers, affecting the high.\nOther methods, like using hash oil, produces a concentrated scent experience so aromatic it feels like smelling an aged perfume. Dieter pulled a Dogwalker resin with a smell reminiscent of jasmine concentrate: dirty, floral, even slightly fecal. In this way, fragrance obsessives are much like cheese hounds or any other aficionados who move with passion into a sensual pursuit \u2014 as they explore their olfactory world, they become more and more enamored with scents that might repel the layperson.\nEmphasizing Fragrance as Part of the Purchasing Decision\nThe importance of scent is beginning to take on a bigger role in the purchasing decision at some of Portland\u2019s leading retail shops. During a recent visit to Oregon\u2019s Finest, a store tucked into the city\u2019s swanky Pearl District, manager Selena Toomey pulled flower-filled apothecary jars off a shelf for me.\n\u201cStrains sell themselves based on their scent,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cIt makes a huge difference in the experience.\u201d\n\nPerfumers are taught to smell coffee beans between samples in order to cleanse their palates. Oregon\u2019s Finest has adapted the practice for the cannabis connoisseur. Toomey invited me to sniff single-origin beans (this is Portland, after all) while passing between strain jars.\nToomey often suggests patients spend up to 10 minutes working the flower in their hands before smoking or vaping it. Doing so, she said, allows you to smell more of the terpenes and enhance the way it tastes when consumed.\n\u201cThe terpenoids and flavonoids play a huge part in opening up your receptors to all of the effects of the cannabis,\u201d Toomey explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like steaming in a hot shower before you moisturize.\u201d\nScent scientists often talk about the cognitive barriers to talking about our often ignored fifth sense \u2014 that we don\u2019t really practice the language needed to really discuss scent.\n\nWhen Toomey talks about scent to her customers, she sometimes avoids scent talk and focuses on taste, which offers a vocabulary more familiar to most consumers. She\u2019ll speak of a strain like Dutch Treat as being like \u201cmint chocolate chip ice cream.\u201d\nToomey has been at Oregon\u2019s Finest since its 2014 opening. She\u2019s seen her customer base grow from curiosity to connoisseurship, even as the shop retains its focus on pot\u2019s medicinal effects.\nShe sells individual terpenes as an additive to other marijuana products for medicinal users. Once you have enough experience to identify specific terpenes by smell alone, you can anticipate the associated high, she said.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m in a dispensary, I can tell by the aroma if a strain will work with my body,\u201d Toomey added. \u201cThe nose knows.\u201d\nEmily Grosvenor is a writer and perfumer based in Oregon.
