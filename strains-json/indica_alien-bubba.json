We experienced the full spectrum of what one might expect from this blend of Kush.\n\nRelaxing and euphoric high, pain gone, and the music sounds divine! As I write this, I should be experiencing my nightly myoclonic epileptic jerks (violent body spasms caused by seizures). Not tonight. Tonight I have Alien Bubba on my side. Top 10 strain of my life. If I had regular access, this would be a go to strain to combat my epilepsy.",
