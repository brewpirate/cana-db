My wife and I tried a 1g full flower, kief, and distillate preroll. We experienced the full spectrum of what one might expect from this blend of Kush.\n\nRelaxing and euphoric high, pain gone, and the music sounds divine! As I write this, I should be experiencing my nightly myoclonic epileptic jerks (violent body spasms caused by seizures). Not tonight. Tonight I have Alien Bubba on my side. Top 10 strain of my life. If I had regular access, this would be a go to strain to combat my epilepsy.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"},{"id":1636971,"username":"Mizu99","text":"Felt like I was skipping around from present to past.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":41,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":31.773399014778324},{"name":"Sweet","score":23.029556650246302},{"name":"Diesel","score":15.886699507389162},{"name":"Pungent","score":12.972085385878486},{"name":"Grape","score":11.247947454844004}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":121.92118226600984},{"name":"Euphoric","score":67.898193760262728},{"name":"Sleepy","score":55.336617405582913},{"name":"Happy","score":47.660098522167488},{"name":"Uplifted","score":41.174055829228237}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":36.165845648604268},{"name":"Insomnia","score":30.58292282430213},{"name":"Pain","score":23.440065681444992},{"name":"Depression","score":19.088669950738918},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":18.144499178981938}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":35.221674876847288},{"name":"PTSD","score":30.172413793103448},{"name":"Hypertension","score":20.114942528735629},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":14.69622331691297},{"name":"Arthritis","score":14.162561576354678}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":29.392446633825941},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":10.057471264367814},{"name":"Headache","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Dizzy","score":7.55336617405583},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.7241379310344827}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/alien-bubba_100x100_746f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/527757/b/alien-bubba__primary_87c6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/alien-bubba_100x100_9cd2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/521869/b/alien-bubba__primary_28cb.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Chicago, IL","Vancouver, BC","Denver, CO","Buckley, WA","Chandler, AZ","Chesaning, MI","Elmwood Park, IL","Everett, WA","Fulton, IL","Glenwood Springs, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.70731707317073/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Bubba Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"bubba-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/bubba-kush","symbol":"Bk","applink":"leafly://strain/bubba-kush"},{"name":"Alien Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"alien-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/alien-kush","symbol":"Alk","applink":"leafly://strain/alien-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
