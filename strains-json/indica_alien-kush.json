It may have you feeling a little spacey, though, as this mostly indica hybrid touches down in the brain first, giving active, sometimes-psychedelic effects that are more traditionally sativa. The active buzz settles over time into a relaxing body buzz that will dissolve both stress and pain. Alien Kush plants have average yields, but they are hardy, easy-to-grow plants, indoors or out. The light green buds have a covering of red or orange hairs and should be airy. This strain has a piney smell, but the taste is a subtle spiciness that is reminiscent of tea.</p>\n",

Flowery sweet aroma, mixed with a woody, earthy undertone. taste is kinda unique, similar to a powerful AK, very strong taste with sweet and flowery undertones, but not too harsh. The come-up is slow and comfy, it starts off in the head and you can feel it just settle out in your body, for a nice deep body buzz(I seriously felt that heavy comfy buzz in my legs and back). Definitely great end to the night...I'll start a good movie, get some popcorn, sit back in my la-z-boy, smoke a cone of alien and space out....A+ strain",
