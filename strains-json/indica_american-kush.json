            "text": "Independence Day is just one day away! At this point, you\u2019ve already cleaned out your local grocery store\u2019s chips, hot dogs, watermelons, and possibly several cases of beer. Your fireworks have been acquired. Your friends have been invited over. You\u2019re ready for the weekend. But which strains will you consume?\nYou can\u2019t just celebrate our nation\u2019s birth with any old strain, and why would you when there are so many festive options to choose from! Whether you\u2019re looking for an uplifting strain or something a little more mellow, these patriotic strains are just the ticket to ring in America\u2019s 239th birthday!\nSpirit of \u201876\n\nNothing better to get you into the spirit of the holiday than Spirit of \u201976! This hybrid hails from Denver, Colorado and boasts a relaxed, uplifted high that will give you the energy you\u2019ll need to make it through a long day of celebration. It\u2019s also particularly well-suited to stimulating appetites, which will give you an added boost to eat that extra hot dog!\nLiberty Haze\n\nThis High Times Cannabis Cup winner offers a refreshing summer lime taste and has lab-tested THC results as high as 25%. An uplifting, energetic hybrid offers heady, cerebral effects that are great at combating anxiety and depression to help ensure your spirits are lifted the whole day through. This strain promises an excellent day of celebration, with liberty and justice for all.\nDanky Doodle\n\nSay what you will about the cannabis industry and puns, we\u2019re still suckers for good wordplay, and Danky Doodle is just that. Originally named Double D in reference to its large buds (we\u2019ll let you make the connection there), the breeder decided to rename the strain to Danky Doodle so as not to confuse it with Double Dutch. This strain provides the full body relief you\u2019ve come to expect with indicas, but it has a lighter, uplifted high then most. It\u2019s the perfect option to provide the pain relief you need without locking you to your couch during the day\u2019s festivities.\nAmerican Kush\n\nGod bless America(n Kush)! This indica boasts a pungent, skunky flavor profile with hints of lemon to spicy notes of lavender and coffee. Patients will benefit from the pain-relieving properties that are known to treat muscle spasms, chronic pain, and nausea. Recreational consumers will love its relaxed, euphoric high. And if you\u2019re looking for a little help eating that last piece of watermelon, the hunger-inducing properties are just for you!\nCherry Bomb\n\nWould it really be the 4th of July without some fireworks? This hybrid isn\u2019t quite as explosive as the firecracker that shares its name, but its happy, uplifted, energetic effects will ensure you\u2019re ready to enjoy the magnificent explosions you\u2019ll no doubt witness. Within moments of your first puff, you\u2019ll feel the strong and active, mentally alert effects that will eventually give way to a smooth, more focused state that will keep you going through the show.\nPresidential OG\n\nOnce the festivities conclude and you\u2019re looking to settle in for a good night\u2019s sleep, Presidential OG is just the strain for you. Almost purely indica, this hard-hitting cross between Bubble Gum and OG Kush will melt your cares away, lulling you into slumber almost immediately (but not before you have a moment to enjoy the intense citrus-pine aroma this dreamy strain omits).\nThere you have it, folks! These strains bleed red, white, and blue, and are everything you\u2019ll need to usher your way through this 4th of July. From all of us at Leafly to you, Happy Independence Day!",

            "text": "Well folks, the \u201cwe have to call it the \u2018Big Game\u2019 because that other name is trademarked but we all know what the \u2018Big Game\u2019 actually refers to\u201d is taking place this Sunday in sunny Houston, Texas. For those of you who are football fans, absurdly expensive commercial fans, or just fans of hanging out with your friends so you can chow down on food and vape your favorite strain while they shake their fists and scream obscenities at the television, here\u2019s a list of some cannabis-infused recipes and strains to make Sunday even more \u201cSuper.\u201d\nCannabis-Infused Recipes for the Big Football Game\n1. Cannabis-Infused Chipotle Avocado Baked Macaroni and Cheese\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love mac and cheese? This homey dish of cannabis-infused cheesy, creamy deliciousness\u00a0will warm the bellies of your friends as they watch the Patriots and Falcons\u00a0face off.\n2. Cannabis-Infused Cucumber Avocado Dip\n\nDips are their own genre of food when it comes to watching sports. This recipe for infused cucumber avocado dip is deceptively healthy but definitely delicious.\n3. Cannabis-Infused Guacamole\n\nSpeaking of dips, guacamole is a must-have at any championship viewing party. But what\u2019s better than guacamole? Cannabis-infused guacamole, of course!\n4. Cannabis-Infused Hummus\n\nThree infused dip recipes? Why the heck not? Pair this infused hummus\u00a0with\u00a0some pita chips or\u00a0crudit\u00e9, or smear it onto chicken feta sliders.\n5. Cannabis-Infused Pesto Pizza\n\nWhip up a few pizzas with different topping combinations for instant viewing party MVP status.\n6. Cannabis-Infused Coleslaw\n\nIf you\u2019re going the BBQ route, this side dish of cannabis-infused coleslaw\u00a0makes a pairing as perfect as Brady and\u00a0Belichick.\n7. Cannabis-Infused Bacon\n\nHonestly, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do with this \u2013 it\u2019s cannabis-infused bacon,\u00a0for crying out loud. Wrap it around dates and roast them so they look like little footballs (laces out!). Make some bacon cheeseburgers. Or just put out a tray of cannabis-infused bacon \u2013 after all, bacon is pretty damn delicious.\nNote: Dosing homemade edibles can be tricky (click here to learn why), so the best way to test for potency is to start with one portion of a serving, wait one to two hours, then make an informed decision on whether to consume more. Always dose carefully and listen to your body, and never drive under the influence of cannabis.\nCannabis Strains to Pick Up for the Big Game\n1. Peaches and Cream\n\nWith\u00a0this guaranteed good-mood hybrid strain, notes reminiscent of sweet Georgia peaches come through in a flavor profile that\u00a0Atlanta fans will absolutely appreciate.\n2. American Kush\n\nFor Patriots fans, this star-spangled indica delivers happy, tingly effects to match how you\u2019ll feel if\u00a0Brady and Belichick do it again.\n3.\u00a0Southern Lights\n\nFor all you Falcons fans, this smoothly smokable sativa relaxes your body and sharpens your mind, letting you take it all in from the comfort of any given couch.\n4. Kaboom\n\nWhenever anyone takes a big hit, take an equally big hit of this\u00a0lemony sativa.\n5. Super Silver Haze\n\nSilver is a tertiary color for both teams headed to Houston, and come\u00a0Sunday those silver accents are going to be looking pretty super.\u00a0Even better,\u00a0this popular sativa will deliver the energy needed to pump you up for the opening kickoff.\n6. Champagne Kush\n\nTreachoself! When the fourth quarter clock reaches zero and the Gatorade is dumped on the winning coach, bust out this uplifting flowery hybrid and celebrate in style.\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\u201dhttp://polldaddy.com/poll/8622212/\u201d&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Who do you think will win the 2015 NFL Championship?&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;",
