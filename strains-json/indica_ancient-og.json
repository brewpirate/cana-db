It has a very trippy mild psychadelic edge to the high which I attribute to one half of this strain being of landrace iranian genetics. I personally would just call this strain the ancient because it just isn't og kushy or plain old kushy at all. It has great bag appeal and trich coverage sweet lemon slightly tropical flavor and a great high. I highly reccomend trying this strain.",
