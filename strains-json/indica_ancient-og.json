The flavor and high were off the charts! It has a very trippy mild psychadelic edge to the high which I attribute to one half of this strain being of landrace iranian genetics. I personally would just call this strain the ancient because it just isn\u0027t og kushy or plain old kushy at all. It has great bag appeal and trich coverage sweet lemon slightly tropical flavor and a great high. I highly reccomend trying this strain.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sPaGuIbcIjKwcF8O7kQXXoAFJ6s=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fkfmswExdS0yqeEmdLkUQ_nerd-green.png"},{"id":1631849,"username":"artyb","text":"If you like indica this is the door to open ( also called emperor OG sometimes) it has an amazing flavor the body effect is just perfect for that after work night time smoke.
