Stronger than any other strain out there if you want to go to bed. Another thing about this bud is it is so sticky you feel like you stuck your fingers in a jar of glue. Highly recommended strain to anyone that is experienced.",

With the little but of CBD this strain has the relaxing feeling lasts hours. This has now become my favorite strain. I'm glad I grow it since dispensaries don't seem to know about this strain. I'm a sufferer of PTSD and my pain and anxiety seem to vanish with Anubis! You'll love it!",
