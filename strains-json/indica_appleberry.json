            "text": "Vaped this after a long & painful day at work. \nDay was hot & grossly humid. Got some Taco Bell at night. Saw my next door neighbor smoking something good next door & asked if he had any to share, & he gave me this baby. \nWent inside to eat. Put on my fave YouTubers (FunHaus). Sat down & took a few hits.\nImmediately tasted apples & berries! Shit tasted so good that I took a few big boy hits by accident lol. \nAte all my Taco Bell. Chicken chalupas & a caramel apple empanada! \nI\u2019m not gonna lie, I had a chubby going on... \nAfter about 30mins, I realize I haven\u2019t taken a hit in awhile... & immediately realize that I was still so high that I forgot I was smoking. \nHad a really good head high going on. Very smooth & clean. Felt a bit warm & fuzzy. Made me very happy. \nTook a few more hits & strengthened that already nice buzz even more! \nEnded up wanting to watch Judge Dredd pretty badly & wanting to share on twitter on how much I love this strain!\nThen finally ended up here. Creating an account just to post this lol. \n\nHappy smoking!",
