    "description": "<p>Also known as A-B, Aurora B., or simply Aurora, Aurora Borealis&nbsp;is a Flying Dutchmen strain resulting from a cross between a carefully selected <a href=\"http://leafly.com/indica/northern-lights\">Northern Lights</a> #10 and a sweet <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1\">Skunk #1</a> father. A&nbsp;vigorous plant with heavy resinous buds, this strain has the best attributes from both its parents. Aurora Borealis&nbsp;grows into a medium size plant similar to Skunk#1, and has a sweet and fruity taste with a hashy&nbsp;sharpness. Very high yields and a fast maturation time make this cross an ideal cash-cropper both indoors and out. The subtle, calming effects have helped this strain gain popularity in the Netherlands and Canada with its sweet, skunky flavors and earthy undertones.</p>\n",

A really energizing strain, don't overindulge else you may spaz out. This with a morning coffee and your co-workers will either think you're a mad genius or just completely mad. More head than body effects. It will cheer you up, make you more talkative, erase a headache, and if you are a comedian you'll be thinking up the funniest shit. Can also make you horny as all hell.
