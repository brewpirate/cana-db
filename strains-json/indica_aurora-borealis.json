This made me feel like I was flying up there in the Northern Lights. I found myself rocketing up, levelling off for a good time then gently gliding down. A really energizing strain, don\u0027t overindulge else you may spaz out. This with a morning coffee and your co-workers will either think you\u0027re a mad genius or just completely mad. More head than body effects. It will cheer you up, make you more talkative, erase a headache, and if you are a comedian you\u0027ll be thinking up the funniest shit. Can also make you horny as all hell.
