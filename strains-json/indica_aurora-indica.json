Each plant was topped once at 4 weeks. 3 plants produced nearly 450g total. Good leaf to bud ratio. Dense bud structure even under a T5. Strong branching required no support. Harvested with cloudy and amber trichomes. Sticky even after months of curing. Gums up a grinder quickly.\n\nWith such a generous yield I was able to try cooking as well as vaping and a couple smoke tokes. I\u0027m typically a nonsmoker but wanted to compare.\n\nVapor and smoke flavor are quite neutral all around. Perhaps leaning on the slightly spicey/hashy side of the pallette. Effect comes on swift but smooth quickly easing into total couchlock. No real head trip effect or paranoia. Overall body and calming effect was strong for 3 to 4 hours and gently faded for another hour or so.\n\nAI is fantastic for night time use. It eased my anxiety, agitation and ruminating during the day but the heavy stone prevented me from being productive. Good for helping one to fall asleep and stay asleep. Not so great for wake n bake unless you\u0027re staying home and your to do list is done.\n\nThis is a heavily Indica dominant strain that means business. Easy to grow indoors. Average looks and taste. Deep couch lock stone.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sPaGuIbcIjKwcF8O7kQXXoAFJ6s=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fkfmswExdS0yqeEmdLkUQ_nerd-green.png"},{"id":1636719,"username":"ctd1000","text":"so beautiful","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3367","title":"New Strains Alert: Plushberry, Dogwalker OG, Aurora Indica, and Brains Damage","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1394238840000)\/","text":"Most cannabis varieties are adept relaxants, but if you’re prone to anxiety and paranoia, finding the right strain can be more difficult.
