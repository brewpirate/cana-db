This says it leaves you hungry.  It made me less hungry! Also many people hear sounds really good.  It's kinda trippy visually also! You may think you see something. Also puts you in a good relaxed state of mind.  As far as yield. It's a great plant and you can make it real bushy.  1-10 scale I would put the yield at a 8. The effects you get I would give it a ten",
