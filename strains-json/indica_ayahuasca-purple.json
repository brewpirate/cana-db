I love this strain!  Tons of crystals on it. Leaves you with tons of hash on the bottom of your grinder.  This says it leaves you hungry.  It made me less hungry! Also many people hear sounds really good.  It\u0027s kinda trippy visually also! You may think you see something. Also puts you in a good relaxed state of mind.  As far as yield. It\u0027s a great plant and you can make it real bushy.  1-10 scale I would put the yield at a 8. The effects you get I would give it a ten","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1633038,"username":"FallenDemon666","text":"Very pungent smell, but very smooth to the core when toked up","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/5DsWrIpoq-56NpD59UXAqpoVN88=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fqSLuo6zNRCeIia1paBYS_wayfarers-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":24,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":66.883116883116884},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":41.558441558441558},{"name":"Pungent","score":41.558441558441558},{"name":"Skunk","score":20.562770562770563},{"name":"Berry","score":18.181818181818183}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":98.917748917748924},{"name":"Relaxed","score":85.4978354978355},{"name":"Sleepy","score":62.121212121212118},{"name":"Happy","score":59.740259740259738},{"name":"Hungry","score":41.125541125541126}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":57.359307359307358},{"name":"Stress","score":53.030303030303031},{"name":"Inflammation","score":45.887445887445892},{"name":"Insomnia","score":45.887445887445892},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":43.506493506493513}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":36.796536796536792},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":27.27272727272727},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":27.27272727272727},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":25.324675324675326},{"name":"Migraines","score":25.324675324675326}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":62.121212121212118},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":29.653679653679649},{"name":"Dizzy","score":9.0909090909090917},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.3809523809523809}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/ayahuasca-purple_100x100_e923.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1003568/b/ayahuasca-purple__primary_ffce.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/ayahuasca-purple_100x100_35a8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/706509/b/ayahuasca-purple__primary_8146.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Toronto, ON","Ottawa, ON","Calgary, AB","Edmonton, AB","Montréal, QC","Hamilton, ON","Québec, QC","Surrey, BC","Ville de Québec, QC","Winnipeg, MB"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.58333333333333/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Master Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"master-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/master-kush","symbol":"Mks","applink":"leafly://strain/master-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
