Grown off the Kishwaukee River. \n\nVery smooth and functional indica high, the skunk background shows up in this one. Buds were nice and tight, had good bag appeal.. especially at the time (we are talking late 90s). The whole \"skunk\" hype was huge back then so anything with it was prized. \n\nHoping to run into this one again someday as it will bring back lots of memories.",
