BARBARA Trick!\"     Here at all!!\n\nI had SUCH high hopes for this one!!  But I was left rather disappointed.  I was hoping for the pain relief this was reported to be relatively famous for but......  \n\nAgain, just like in my review for WHITE WIDOW, if I could give 1/2 a star I would have given this one 2 1/2 Stars.  Now that being said, let me go over the pros AND cons for me at least....  This is not to say everyone feels this way or that my experience is going to be the exact same as you will have, but for me the breakdown is like this.....\n\nSmell and appearance was nice, the smell I was expecting to be more fruity like I have seen in a few reviews...  Disappointment #1..  The smoke was nice clean and did last for a pretty good amount of time  and the fact that I did not cough much at all is also a bonus, so there is the 2 1/2 stars right there.  But it did little for the pain relief.  I had to mix it with some other strains to do better in the pain department which is sad because out of several reviews on a few sites, I decided to not just buy this strain, but Tilray had a deal for 15 grams for $100.  so it worked out to be like $6.66 per gram.  But the silver lining I guess would be that I can use it to make special butter for baking!  That will be putting it to the best use!  And it made me really tired and so it is good for people who are having a real hard time with getting to sleep or suffer from bouts of insomnia.  I would have given another star for that fact, but I do not suffer from insomnia so... No dice on that one.  (Hey like I said, my experiences could very well differ from yours, and the reasons I got it could and likely are different that what you may be looking for)  On the plus side, if you are looking for a rather mild stone or are quite sensitive to THC and do not need a high %-age to get the relief you need then this can quite easily become a 31/2 to 4 star product for you...  Just not for me...\n\nSorry Barbara...  I had such high hopes..  I am still looking for reasons to give it more than a 2 1/2 star rating, but I just can\u0027t.  If I suffered from insomnia then sure, but like I said I don\u0027t so 2 1/2 it remains for me.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/2/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1596256,"username":"heitorhects","text":"This weed is very good use when you’re stressed or can’t sleep.
