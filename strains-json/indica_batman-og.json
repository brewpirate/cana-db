            "text": "We\u2019re at the height of comic book culture, an era in which superheroes and the worlds they struggle to keep safe have become so mainstream, they have their own rich universes spanning across film franchises, streaming TV shows, toy lines, LEGO spinoffs, and jam-packed conventions. But before Jessica Jones grit, Aquaman hype, and the umpteenth Spider-Man reboot, we had the Caped Crusader, a Dark Knight who\u2019s been keeping the streets of Gotham safe since 1939.\nOver the ensuing decades, Batman would battle Jokers, Penguins, and, at one point, Floronic Man, who had the ability to accelerate plant growth thanks to his advanced knowledge of botany (sounds like a \u201csea of green\u201d grower to me). While we don\u2019t know for sure that this Gotham baddie with the green thumb was pro-cannabis, we can\u2019t imagine a better way to celebrate Batman\u2019s storied history and enduring pop culture relevance than by pondering which Batman-themed cannabis strains and products could win over Floronic Man, Poison Ivy, and even the Caped Crusader himself (because even Batman suffers from aches and pains).\nEnjoy this roundup of items that may cause you to utter, \u201cHoly smokes, Batman!\nBatman-Themed Cannabis Products and Accessories\nBatman Etched Glass Stash Jar\n\nThis stash jar from Etsy is a cheeky way to store your favorite nugs or edibles, especially if you\u2019re an old school Adam West-era Batman fan.\nPrice: $24.99 plus shipping\nBatman Grinder\n\nGrind up your bud of choice with this subtle black and silver 4-tier grinder featuring the Bat logo emblazoned across the top.\nPrice: $19.84\nBatgirl Cowl\n\nDoes this Batgirl cowl have anything to do with cannabis? No, of course not. Can you wear it and feel like a bad-ass superhero during your next smoke sesh? Yes, of course you can.\nPrice: $150\nDark Knight Portable Pipe and Carrying Case\n\nShow off your nerd love for the Dark Knight with this Batman-themed glass pipe. It comes with a protective case featuring the silhouette of the Caped Crusader himself, so you\u2019re reassured in knowing that Bruce Wayne\u2019s alter ego is keeping your accessories safe from harm.\nPrice: $29.99\nCatwoman Custom Bic Lighter\n\nSlink around town with this comics-inspired Bic lighter featuring Gotham\u2019s most famous cat burglar. Each design varies slightly, so your feline fire starter will feature a unique Catwoman aesthetic.\nPrice: $6.99\nBatman-Themed Cannabis Strains\n\u00a0 \u00a0Sour Joker\nSour Joker is the stimulating sativa blend of Amnesia Haze and East Coast Sour Diesel (ECSD). This amped combination offers consumers a vigorous body buzz that is clear-headed and motivating, encouraging physical activity in or outside. Harness the mental clarity of this strain at lower doses and the fueled-up stimulation with continued use.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harlequin (Harley Quinn)\nHarlequin is a 75/25 sativa-dominant strain renowned for its reliable expression of CBD. A descendant of Colombian Gold, a Nepali indica, and\u00a0Thai\u00a0and Swiss landrace strains, you can depend on Harlequin to provide clear-headed, alert sativa effects. Unlike most high-CBD strains, Harlequin almost always develops a CBD:THC ratio of 5:2, making this strain one of the most effective out there for treatment of pain and anxiety, as CBD can counteract THC\u2019s paranoia while amplifying its painkilling properties. Flavors can range from earthy musk to sweet mango, but without a doubt, what draws crowds to Harlequin is its ability to relax without sedation and to relieve without intoxication.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Batman OG\nBatman OG, named for the Caped Crusader of the DC Universe, is a potent indica that hits the body like POW! This knockout strain binds the consumer to the couch and offers relaxing physical effects that are calming and sedative. Batman OG has deep earthy notes intermixed with scents of skunk and pine. It combats insomnia, stress, and chronic pain so well, it will have you saying, \u201cHoly indica, Batman!\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Batgirl\nBatgirl is a sativa-dominant hybrid with beautiful effects. This Jack\u2019s Cleaner and Blueberry\u00a0cross brings out a unique and pleasant aroma of sweet berry and spicy chemicals. The strain\u2019s hybrid effects express themselves as a heady euphoria that uplifts the mind while gently coating the body in calming haze. Weight can be felt on the eyelids as Batgirl circulates a warm, calming sensation through the body, making this strain ideal for consumers looking to shrug off stress and fatigue while improving mood.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Riddler OG\nRiddle me this! Riddler OG, also known as \u201cPower,\u201d is a trichome-rich hybrid that blends the heady, uplifting euphoria of Sour Dubble with the mid-level Kush-driven body effects of Master Kush. These effects come together to form a well-balanced hybrid that is useful and enjoyable any time of the day. With bright hues and earthy undertones, Riddler OG caters to consumers looking for a middle-of-the-road body buzz with a happy, uplifted mental state that will induce laughter and an overall carefree sensation.",
