            "text": "For all you football and crazy commercial enthusiasts out there, the big game is this Sunday and as the national media frenzy swirls around NFL players, it grabs hold of anything worth mentioning,\u00a0from what hat a player wears to their thoughts on Katy Perry. In fact, this year\u00a0even a cannabis strain has captured the media's attention.\u00a0\nYou may have already caught wind of the reports of a new strain of cannabis named Beast Mode 2.0 in honor of the\u00a0Seattle Seahawks\u2019 star running back Marshawn Lynch.\u00a0Everyone from local newspapers to TMZ and Bleacher Report have been reporting on the new strain. Most attribute it as just another cannabis marketing ploy, like the one Peyton Manning squashed last year, but I wanted to know more. So,\u00a0I contacted Nate \u201cDiggity\u201d Johnson, owner of Green Umbrella, to get an in depth look at the new strain.\n\nBeast Mode 2.0 was developed after the success of another Beast Mode variety last year. The original Beast Mode strain, Beast Mode OG, was a happy accident that occurred when Zion Gardens was gifted what they believed to be a cut of GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) from a source in Northern California. However, after flowering the clone\u00a0they quickly realized that these were not GSC genetics, and by autumn of 2013 the plant was dried, cured, and ready for market. The team was certain their new strain was either a compelling but mysterious hybrid of OG Kush, or simply an exceptional phenotype of the superstar strain. After trying the strain for the first time, the growers\u00a0decided that the potent effects hit hard much\u00a0like Marshawn Lynch attacking\u00a0a running lane on the football field.\nAfter the success of both Beast Mode OG and the Seahawks' championship run\u00a0last year, Nate decided it was only proper to truly develop a strain from scratch that would align with the running style and personality of Seattle\u2019s beloved\u00a0Beast Mode. Without much pushback or threat of legal action, he\u00a0decided to pursue the project with the help of Grass Roots Pharm.\n\nBeast Mode 2.0 was refined\u00a0during the\u00a0summer through selective breeding while working with Master Kush and White Fire OG genetics. The end result is an indica-dominant hybrid that hits hard and relaxes away pain, like the aches and agony defenders must feel after battling Beast Mode for four\u00a0quarters. According to Green Umbrella, the strain has registered as high as 23% THC, just shy of the number 24 that Marshawn wears.\nThe aroma of Beast Mode 2.0 is fruity and sweet. It has a berry note that sparks memories of fresh blueberry muffins, and produces an\u00a0earthy flavor of sweet herbs that is followed by a mellow pine aftertaste that I attribute to the influence of OG Kush genetics.\nThe effects from the first bong toke are led by an instant rush of warmth to the forehead and ears. Shortly after, the muscles around my eyes loosened up and a calming indica wave extended\u00a0down the spine, relaxing the lower extremities. The aggressive sedating properties are a great way to decompress at the end of a long day, but it might be best to avoid this strain when you are trying to cross things off your to-do list.\n\nCurrently Beast Mode 2.0 is only available medicinally in the Seattle area, with exclusive distribution handled by Nate at Green Umbrella. You can also find it at a few select dispensaries like Greenside Medical in Lake City,\u00a0Delta 9 in Wallingford, and Conscious Care in Ballard.\nIf you live in Seattle or if you come to visit, make sure to look out for both of the Beast Mode strains. And if you get a chance to try either of these (or any other exciting or effective strains) varieties, be sure to leave a review on the strains\u2019 detail page. If you don\u2019t think Beast Mode 2.0 is for you, you can\u00a0find other popular strains on the Leafly Strain Explorer. Be safe this weekend, enjoy the game, and go Seahawks!",
