            "text": "One of my favorite smelling and tasting buds. Very fruity smell like peaches and apples, accompanied by flowers like fresh blossoms with undertones of skunk. Starts in the head smoothly taking control of the mind relieving anxiety and stress and replacing it with happiness and euphoria. Turns into a full body buzz that warms the body and kills all my pain (irritable bowel disease). The relaxation effect Big Bang gives is very pleasant and can easily rock you into a deep sleep if smoked too much. I have found no negative effects from this strain other than trying to contain its stank that reeks up a room very fast :D",
