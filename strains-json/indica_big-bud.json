I've asked every dispensary to give me there \"guaranteed\" knock you out strain and none has worked for me. Not until I got my hands on good ole big bud. Great body buzz uplifting just basic sit on the couch relax and watch TV till you pass out smoke! It relaxed my body pain (fibro) and I felt like I was laying on a cloud. Best feeling I've had in a long time. \r\n\r\nI do consider myself a MJ snob but nothing like Big Bud for your basic relax kick back smoke!\r\n\r\nI'll pick it off the bottom shelf every time!!!",
