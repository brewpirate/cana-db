Biochem is pretty  OP, so it will overwhelm a beginning user.  When I got this strain, it was so kiefy I could barely see the purple leaves.  The sensations of the strain are quite pleasant.  I feel a prevalent head high and subtle body high that is good for muscle relaxation.  It feels like effects of Asgardian Magic.  The flavors are sweet with a hint of citrus and berry.
