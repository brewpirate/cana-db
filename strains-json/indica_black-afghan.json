Usually grown in boutique batches and a descendent of Sensi Seeds and their white label subsidiary, it is a hybrid with the infamous Black Domina and hard to find Afghan Kush - the most resinous of all afghani landraces. Acquired from a celebrated grower in San Diego with a documented lab reports showing THC levels above 26 percent and 2.5 percent CBD. Euphoric and sleep-inducing; I was almost hallucinating. Flavor is terrific and classically afghani. Reminds me of Mazar Sharif. A+ and not for amateurs.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/rfCAo_Cv5-R2VdW_OzF7GFZLWzo=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net%2fLX75xmNmc1EAEx3zx9mm_NI_xtg%3d%2f120x120%2fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3.amazonaws.com%252Fleafly%252Fbin%252F81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":30,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":75.793650793650784},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":28.769841269841269},{"name":"Sweet","score":18.253968253968253},{"name":"Pungent","score":17.063492063492063},{"name":"Pine","score":14.88095238095238}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":104.76190476190476},{"name":"Sleepy","score":103.37301587301587},{"name":"Euphoric","score":68.253968253968253},{"name":"Uplifted","score":47.619047619047606},{"name":"Happy","score":41.865079365079367}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":71.825396825396822},{"name":"Insomnia","score":55.357142857142847},{"name":"Depression","score":52.380952380952372},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":41.269841269841265},{"name":"Stress","score":40.674603174603178}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":32.936507936507937},{"name":"Migraines","score":26.984126984126984},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":24.6031746031746},{"name":"PMS","score":20.039682539682538},{"name":"PTSD","score":20.039682539682538}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":15.476190476190474},{"name":"Paranoid","score":13.492063492063492},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":7.1428571428571423},{"name":"Dizzy","score":4.1666666666666661}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/black-afghan_100x100_d701.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/621067/b/black-afghan__primary_b29d.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Bellingham, WA","Berkeley, CA","Calgary, AB","Edmonton, AB","Las Vegas, NV","Montr√©al, QC","Spokane, WA","Toronto, ON","Winnipeg, MB"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/black-afghan","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Black Domina","subtitle":null,"slug":"black-domina","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/black-domina","symbol":"Bdm","applink":"leafly://strain/black-domina"},{"name":"Afghan Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghan-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghan-kush","symbol":"Afk","applink":"leafly://strain/afghan-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
