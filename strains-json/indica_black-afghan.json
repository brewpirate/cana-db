            "text": "One of the strongest, heavy-handed, euphoric strains I've encountered, even as a Cali native. Usually grown in boutique batches and a descendent of Sensi Seeds and their white label subsidiary, it is a hybrid with the infamous Black Domina and hard to find Afghan Kush - the most resinous of all afghani landraces. Acquired from a celebrated grower in San Diego with a documented lab reports showing THC levels above 26 percent and 2.5 percent CBD. Euphoric and sleep-inducing; I was almost hallucinating. Flavor is terrific and classically afghani. Reminds me of Mazar Sharif. A+ and not for amateurs.",
