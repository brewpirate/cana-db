    "description": "<p>Black D.O.G. by Humboldt Seed Organization is a weighty mixture of two northern California favorites, <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-kush\">Blackberry Kush</a> and Emerald Headband. This medium-sized plant expresses dark, nearly black leaves that give way to sticky, dense buds. Its aroma is a mixture of grape, berries, and oil while the effects tend to be relaxing with just a touch of cerebral stimulation. Black D.O.G. has a rapid flowering time of 48-55 days and has been known to produce a THC profile in the 16-21% range.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n",
