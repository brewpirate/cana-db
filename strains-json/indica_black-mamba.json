I must have apologized 100 times....I felt so removed from my mania that I could clearly see my actions for how destructive they were.  Mania always takes out all emotion and love from me....when I smoked this strain....it\u0027s like everything returned to normal.  \n\nWe ended up talking and crying together for the next hour as we worked out a lot of my problems with ways to prevent this from happening in the future.  \n\nLook, I have an amazing, loving wife to which I am extremely blessed.  But and I have always seen being bipolar as this dark side that is such a burden to the ones I love.  This strain changes everything.  I thank God for this strain....you have no idea how much stability it has brought back into my life.  \n\nJust an hour ago, I felt myself feeling manic, so I smoked from my pen and like it has in the past, it cut everything I was feeling and brought me back to normal.  It also allows me to work like I normally would.  I am still sharp and focused...I\u0027m not wanting to pass out or in a state of couch lock.  I was thinking about how there has to be others out there like me who need help and I wanted to share my joy.  \n\nGod Bless you guys....\n\n**I vape this strain from an O-Pen.   If you are in LA, go to The Wellness Earth Energy Dispensary in Studio City.  They have hands down the biggest Vape selection.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1633371,"username":"Dominguez1","text":"Fantastic strain to wind down with after work.
