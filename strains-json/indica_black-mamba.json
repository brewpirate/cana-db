            "text": "This strain is an utter Godsend for me.  I am bipolar and there are times when I feel myself slipping into Mania.  Typically I would just have to ride it out and apologize to my wife and friends when the mania ends.  Sometimes it lasts a few hours.  Sometimes a week.  This has ALWAYS been the hardest thing about being bipolar....becoming manic  and losing control and seeing the trail of destruction I leave behind me has been devastating.  But this strain....it takes me from manic to normal in 5 minutes.  The first time I tried it, I was about 3 hours into mania and I was saying a lot of mean things to my wife.  I felt like I was having an out of body experience and I couldn't feel empathy, love....anything.  That's when she told me to go smoke and come back.  (Weed is still a new form of medication for me.  I HATE chemical drugs and will let that be a last resort....).  \n\nSo I did....when I came back, I felt 100% normal.  I was horrified by my actions and was able to see the monster I became.  I must have apologized 100 times....I felt so removed from my mania that I could clearly see my actions for how destructive they were.  Mania always takes out all emotion and love from me....when I smoked this strain....it's like everything returned to normal.  \n\nWe ended up talking and crying together for the next hour as we worked out a lot of my problems with ways to prevent this from happening in the future.  \n\nLook, I have an amazing, loving wife to which I am extremely blessed.  But and I have always seen being bipolar as this dark side that is such a burden to the ones I love.  This strain changes everything.  I thank God for this strain....you have no idea how much stability it has brought back into my life.  \n\nJust an hour ago, I felt myself feeling manic, so I smoked from my pen and like it has in the past, it cut everything I was feeling and brought me back to normal.  It also allows me to work like I normally would.  I am still sharp and focused...I'm not wanting to pass out or in a state of couch lock.  I was thinking about how there has to be others out there like me who need help and I wanted to share my joy.  \n\nGod Bless you guys....\n\n**I vape this strain from an O-Pen.   If you are in LA, go to The Wellness Earth Energy Dispensary in Studio City.  They have hands down the biggest Vape selection.",
