It\u0027s an AK-47 x Hash Plant named ak-hash. This is in homage to the grower who developed it. In dispensaries you will see it often labeled as BBK. It\u0027s in essence the same flower. Very beautiful sage green super dense flowers , smooth smoke and a strain if recommend to anyone. What\u0027s kind of funny is on this app I\u0027ve noticed varies flowers linage   , names and classification . This is in fact a sativa dominant flower(I\u0027m talking the original cut) .
