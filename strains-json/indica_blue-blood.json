            "text": "Blue Blood is my very first high CBD low THC strain, and would you believe it, Blue Blood is in my top 5 strains? It takes first place in smell and taste - it truly smells like pure blueberry, more than any other \"blue\" strain I've tried, and I've tried many of them. For smell and taste alone I would give it full marks, but the specialness of Blue Blood doesn't stop at smell and taste.\n\nWhile the THC is low (mine only tested at 9.66%) the CDBs are very high at 10.29%. My body almost instantly feels relaxed after smoking Blue Blood, like my body melts into the mattress and the full body relaxation leads to a lovely couch lock while only being lightly high.\n\nI use indica every night to help me sleep, so what I've been doing is smoking a bowl of a higher THC indica such as Blackberry Kush, then after that smoke a bowl of Blue Blood to top it off.\n\nWhat I would like so much is to get a vape concentrate of Blue Blood. If I ever see Blue Blood seeds for sale I would totally consider growing a crop of it some year.",
