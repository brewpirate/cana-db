It takes first place in smell and taste - it truly smells like pure blueberry, more than any other \"blue\" strain I\u0027ve tried, and I\u0027ve tried many of them. For smell and taste alone I would give it full marks, but the specialness of Blue Blood doesn\u0027t stop at smell and taste.\n\nWhile the THC is low (mine only tested at 9.66%) the CDBs are very high at 10.29%. My body almost instantly feels relaxed after smoking Blue Blood, like my body melts into the mattress and the full body relaxation leads to a lovely couch lock while only being lightly high.\n\nI use indica every night to help me sleep, so what I\u0027ve been doing is smoking a bowl of a higher THC indica such as Blackberry Kush, then after that smoke a bowl of Blue Blood to top it off.\n\nWhat I would like so much is to get a vape concentrate of Blue Blood. If I ever see Blue Blood seeds for sale I would totally consider growing a crop of it some year.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1485896,"username":"iloveelectricchairs","text":"Total anxiety calmer and very sweet taste.
