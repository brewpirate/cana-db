            "text": "Cannabis is a flower. And like flowers, cannabis exhibits strong, diverse odors that will stimulate your mind and elicit different sensations based on those smells (and, when smoked, flavors). These smell- and flavor-inducing chemicals are known as terpenes, which are representative of potential effects inside each unique flower. Linalool, for example, is a powerful terpene most commonly associated with lavender. It\u2019s known for its relaxing, sedative effects \u2014 the same thing people hope to inspire when they place a pouch of lavender under their pillows before bed.\n\nCannabis is a flower. Lavender is a flower. So what? Flowers smell like flowers.\nWait. Hold your horses, y\u2019all. Here\u2019s where it gets weird.\nOf all the terpenes, of which more than 200 are found in cannabis, many evoke smells that don\u2019t occur naturally in nature. Today, we are going to focus on a few terpenes near and dear to my heart (and stomach): CHEESE!\nThe \u201ccheesy\u201d terpenes are easily some of the most pungent and challenging. But the strains reward the adventurous palate with brilliant, uplifting effects that are pleasantly stimulating and luscious.\n\nSuch terpenes include octanoic acid, (methyl thio) butyrate, ethylmethyl acetic acid, hexanoic acid, isovaleric acid, and methyl mercaptan. These chemicals traverse the scale of cheesiness from the sweet, vanilla ice cream elements of Dairy Queen to the significantly cave-aged earthiness of OG Cheese and UK Cheese.\nBut cheese strains aren\u2019t exclusively savory. Like many fine cheese plates, fruit notes add a complementary sweetness to the umami qualities of a truly robust queso. Strains like Blueberry Cheesecake, Blue Cheese, Sweet Cheese, Bubble Cheese, and many more incorporate sweet elements that can bring creeping indica effects to this primarily sativa-hybrid family.\nCheese terpenes may not be the most pleasant to smell, but they are everywhere. Check out this quote by THCFarmer.com pertaining to one of the many cheese-like terpenes:\n\u201cIsovaleric Acid has a strong, pungent, sour, stinky feet, sweaty cheese smell. It is a major component of the cause of unpleasant foot odor. However, its volatile esters have pleasing scents and are used widely in perfumery. Used as a flavoring it is cheesy, dairy, sweet creamy, fermented, waxy and berry. It has shown effectiveness as an anticonvulsant and antidepressant.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t a recommendation to huff your stinky socks in an effort to conquer depression, but a simple illustration of the fine line between the refined and the repulsive. So go on: Grab a bowl, smile, and say, \u201ccheese!\u201d Looking for some options? Check the \u201ccheese\u201d filter in our strain explorer for some pungent options!",

Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Blue Cheese is a heavy indica strain that was created by crossing UK Cheese and Blueberry. The strain offers a funky cheese-like aroma combined with a unique blueberry scent. It\u2019s a potent strain commonly used by medical patients for pain management.\nGrow Techniques: Grow Blue Cheese indoors or outdoors in any medium. You can train the plants to increase yields or top them to help round out the growth. Blue Cheese is a vigorous grower and strong plant that easily\u00a0resists mold and infections, making it a good choice for novice growers.\nFlowering Time: 7-8 weeks\nYield: Moderate\nGrow Difficulty: Easy to moderate\nClimate: Prefers cool to moderate temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Growing Blue Cheese indoors allows you to easily train the plant. Outdoors is also a good option because of its ability to handle cooler temperatures.\nFeeding: Blue Cheese is a strong plant with lots of foliage, and it will need plenty of nutrients to grow. Because of its vigorous growth, it is hard to overfeed. Nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, and silica are great friends to this strain.",
