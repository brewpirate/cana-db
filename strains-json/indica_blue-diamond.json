That said, have you ever wondered which cannabis strain best reflects your astrological sign? We were curious so we took it upon ourselves to pair up the best strains that complement each personality type based on their horoscope sign.\nWhether you‚Äôre as stubborn as a ram, as dramatic as a lion, or as balanced as a scale, we‚Äôve got a strain for you!
