Fulfilling all of our indica expectations, Blue God produces crushing full-body effects ideal for nighttime treatment of pain and sleep disorders.

Definitely couch locked, kind of spacey and scattered. Perfect for soaking in the tub while listening to a Peter Gabriel soundtrack. Excellent spatial hearing effect, watching TV I could sense certain sounds bouncing off of various surfaces. Fell asleep on the couch, hardly saw my show at all ...Zzzzz...went to bed and slept through the night.\n\n11 days later- I haven't used as much because I have had sativa early evening to keep going.  I really do still love this stuff. In fact, when 1/4s were on for $50, I grabbed one. Very good for toke and soak- and pretty sleepy at the end. Excellent pain relief.",
