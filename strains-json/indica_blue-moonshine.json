            "text": "Folk music is a unique genre in that it can sometimes be difficult to pinpoint. Having been passed down through oral tradition, folk is usually characterized by its vibrant vocals, familiar lyrics and \u201cold world\u201d feel. This definition is fluid, however, with many disagreeing about what exactly classifies something as \u201cfolk music.\u201d Perhaps Louis Armstrong said it best when he declared, \u201cAll music is folk music; I ain\u2019t never heard a horse sing a song.\u201d\nStill, folk music has a certain down-to-earth, down-home, family vibe that can at least be recognized by the feeling the sounds elicit. The following is a list of some suggested folk albums to offer such moods, best enjoyed while relaxing with some earthy, perhaps home-grown grass.\nDead & Born & Grown \u2013 The Staves\n\nThe Staves are an English folk rock band comprised of sisters Jessica, Camilla and Emily Staveley-Taylor. If there were ever such a thing as the mythological creatures known as sirens, you can be sure their voices would sound like this. The Staveley sisters\u2019 bright, elegant vocals intertwine seamlessly, transporting the listener instantly into a world of their own creation. The songs on their album, Dead & Born & Grown, move together like a river, evoking a timeless sound that is at once both hypnotically peaceful and excitingly lively.\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Super Silver Haze\nPushin\u2019 Against a Stone \u2013 Valerie June\n\nValerie June\u2019s unique and crystal clear vocals rise in this album like a sun breaking over the sea. The sound that cradles her ethereal voice is at once both folk, soul, blues, and Appalachian, but that down-home vibe shines through as the prominent feel of the album. Pushin\u2019 Against a Stone is June\u2019s breakthrough album, catapulting her from Tennessee to a worldwide stage, and it\u2019s easy to understand why. June\u2019s soulful and vibrant voice is as much a powerful instrument as any played by the musicians who join her project.\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Cherry Pie\nElectric Dirt \u2013 Levon Helm\n\nElectric Dirt is drummer and singer-songwriter Levon Helm\u2019s final studio album, produced in 2009. The album is a collection of covers and two original songs, including \u201cGrowing Trade,\u201d an original song about a poor farmer who turns to growing cannabis to make ends meet despite it being illegal. The album is eclectic, powerful, joyful, sorrowful, and raw. Helm\u2019s post-recovery vocals are gruff yet flawless, evoking a truly southern, folky feel. He is joined by a full band and his daughter, harmony vocalist Amy Helm. Listening to this album feels like a perfect summer day in the deep south, sitting on an old weathered porch with a good dog snoozing at your feet.\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: S.A.G.E\nSemper Femina \u2013 Laura Marling\n\nBritish singer-songwriter Laura Marling has been producing albums since 2008. Her latest work, released this past March and titled Semper Femina, delivers a raw and haunting sound that evokes femininity, grace, and purpose. Marling\u2019s vocals are precise, deep, and melodious, a perfect complement to the graceful instrumentals of her music. There is a hint of traditional English classical in her style, and suggestions of jazz that add subtle textures to this otherwise lovingly folk music. Semper Femina, which translates to \u201calways woman,\u201d feels more personal than her previous albums, inviting the listener into the heart of her home to explore the sounds of her being.\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Plushberry\nWays Not to Lose \u2013 The Wood Brothers\n\nWays Not to Lose features brothers Oliver and Chris Wood. The acoustic album contains twelve songs and offers a fresh take on traditional folk with a hint of rock tucked under the down-to-earth folk vibe. Chris Wood\u2019s deep, prominent standup bass complements Oliver\u2019s twangy and bright guitar. When Oliver\u2019s rustic voice and poignant lyrics combine with Chris\u2019 backing vocals, the duo comprise an album that feels as though the pair slipped back in time to add a modern taste to traditional old world music.\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Blue Moonshine\nThe world of folk music is as vast and diverse as the people of this world. The above is, truthfully, merely a taste of the endless possibilities of folk music. One thing is to be sure, though: folk is a music meant to be enjoyed and passed down from person to person, family to family. One may even say it is a genre that seeks to preserve how it feels to have a human experience in a particular moment of time, and to share that feeling for generations to come.",

            "text": "While people think of chilling as simply doing as little as possible, it actually takes some effort. To do less in the best way possible, you need to create an atmosphere and game plan that fits the mood.\nLuckily, we\u2019ve gone out and done the hard work for you. Just as we did with November 2015's Netflix release list, we urge you to use our guide to plan out a variety of Netflix and chill sessions for the month of December.\n\u00a0\n1. Have a #TBT Night\nWatch: F is for Family\nGenre: Animated Sitcom\nChill Situation: The new series created by comedian Bill Burr and written by Michael Price (you might know him as an award-winning writer for The Simpsons) is a family comedy set in the 1970s, \u201ca time when you could smack your kid, smoke inside, and bring a gun to the airport.\" Though it\u2019s based on Burr\u2019s childhood, he actually voices the father, Frank Murphy, while his wife is played by Laura Dern, and his sons by Justin Long and Haley Reinhart. You can check out the trailer to get excited until the six-episode season debuts on December 18.\nSnack of Choice: A TV dinner or a Wonder Bread sandwich only seems fitting.\nVibe: To enhance a nostalgic night in, pick up some Deep Chunk. This strain has roots in Afghanistan and was brought to Northern California in the 1970\u2019s, which means that from the first puff, you\u2019ll recognize that iconic smoke and happy, relaxing stone. For best results, grind up some Deep Chunk for use in your vaporizer.\n\u00a0\n2. Nurse a Night Out\u2019s Next Day\nWatch: Real Rob\nGenre: Comedy Series\nChill Situation: The eight-episode series starring Rob Schneider is meant to be an exaggerated but honest depiction of his real life and follows him as he manages \"the ups and downs of a Hollywood career,\" according to the release. Let the painfully awkward moments of this show remind you that whatever happened last night couldn\u2019t have been nearly as embarrassing as whatever Schneider experiences. Debuts December 1.\nSnack of Choice: Your favorite breakfast sandwich, enjoyed in bed.\nVibe: After a night out, to ease an aching head and a grumpy belly, check out Blue Moonshine. This strain comes from the famed DJ Short, and with heavy indica roots, it will quell your aches and have you chillaxing and giggling. Blue Moonshine works magic for aches, pains, and appetites \u2014 just watch out for any resulting sleepiness.\n\u00a0\n3. Host a Holiday Gathering\nWatch: A Very Murray Christmas\nGenre: Musical Comedy\nChill Situation: Bill Murray made a Christmas musical, so if you were looking for a holiday miracle this year, chances are this is it. In the story, Murray is putting on a TV variety show but is worried no one will be able to come because of a massive snowstorm hitting New York. With the help of lots of famous friends including George Clooney, Amy Poehler, Miley Cyrus, Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, Jenny Lewis, Chris Rock, and more, the show goes on. It\u2019s directed by Sofia Coppola. There is no way this won\u2019t be incredible. And there is nothing more Murray than this 24-second teaser video. Available December 1.\nSnack of Choice: Cookies! Roasted chestnuts! Hot cocoa!\nVibe: For the perfect complementary strain, look no further than Dutch Treat Haze. With the sociable influence of Dutch Treat combined with the uplifting cerebral effects of Haze, this strain is the perfect balance for socializing with friends and family, laughing your buns off, and chowing down on all the holidays treats your tummy can handle.\n\u00a0\n4. Throw an Adam Sandler Roast Party\nWatch: The Ridiculous Six\nGenre: Western Comedy\nChill Situation: People have been lamenting and mocking Adam Sandler\u2019s downward trajectory for a while now, but let us not forget that he gave us classics like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy before, you know, agreeing to be in Paul Blart: Mall Cop. The Ridiculous Six is sure to offer some of the absurdity noted in the title as well as some stereotypes, as it\u2019s a satire of western movies from the 1970s. But with a cast including Steve Buscemi, Luke Wilson, Terry Crews, and Will Forte, there are sure to be some laughs. Debuts December 11.\nSnack of Choice: Rare steaks and potatoes.\nVibe: For maximum lolz, check out Hippie Crippler. This sativa-dominant hybrid offers a happy, focused high, along with a relaxing vibe to keep you engrossed in supremely enjoying the movie. If you can find it, Hippie Crippler in concentrate form is a delightfully tasty way to indulge and enhance your funny bone.",
