            "text": "The blues is a timeless genre full of heart and soul. Starting in the 19th\u00a0century, blues formed in black communities of the deep south and has strong roots in African musical traditions. Early blues songs were accompanied by lyrics recounting experiences of racial discrimination and other similar hardships faced by black Americans. The genre has persisted through the years, often being combined with elements of jazz, soul, rock, spirituals, and R&B.\n\nWhatever form it takes, the blues is a genre that grabs you by the heart and demands an emotional response. Below, enjoy five impactful blues albums with our recommended strains and tune in to your emotional center.\nSouthern Avenue by Southern Avenue\n(Spotify)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Bluniverse\nSouthern Avenue released its lively self-titled album in 2017 and burst onto the blues scene with a refreshing style.

Helm\u2019s lyrics are engaging and soulful, making it a joy to sing along and pour your emotions into every note.\nFind Blue Lights Nearby\n\nThe Marcus King Band by The Marcus King Band\n(Spotify)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Blue Diesel\nThe Marcus King Band\u00a0is a powerful, hard-hitting album released in 2016, and also marks frontman Marcus King\u2019s second album.

            "text": "Mix together American roots music such as bluegrass, rhythm and blues, country, and folk, then stir in a hearty portion of down-to-earth charisma, et voil\u00e0: Americana music. At its heart, Americana has a deeply rustic feel, and exists at the intersection of some or all of these classic roots genres. It\u2019s the kind of music that paints a grand picture of open country, roaming plains and old American charm.\n\nAmericana is special not only because it acts as the child of so many other beloved genres, but because it exemplifies the blending of the old with the new. It has the capacity to uplift and energize while spilling over with honest emotion, creating a sound that is both deeply human and largely joyful. We recommend gathering your favorite people, rolling a fat joint, and exploring the following Americana albums as you nestle into an elevated state of mind.\nLeaving Eden by Carolina Chocolate Drops\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Blueberry Pie\nLeaving Eden is at once up-on-your-feet, slap-your-knee, circle-swinging-dance music. But in the next breath it is also soft, heartfelt and gentle. This album can make you feel like you\u2019re stepping back in time to rediscover the quintessential idea of old folk roots music\u2014as with the song \u201cBoodle-De-Bum-Bum\u201d\u2014but the very next song \u201cCountry Girl\u201d will yank you out of the reverie and thrust you into the present with its upbeat, modern vibes and vocals. The title track \u201cLeaving Eden\u201d encourages reflection and a release of emotion with its gentle purring.\nCarolina Chocolate Drops is comprised of Hubby Jenkins, Rowan Corbett, Malcolm Parson, and Rhiannon Giddens, with Giddens\u2019 powerful yet delicate vocals often at the forefront of their sound. Between the four of them is a wide variety of instrumentation including guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle, kazoo, drum, djembe, and cello. This album has a full, intricate sound that shifts and changes with each track, allowing it to hold its listener\u2019s attention effortlessly.\nThe Carrier by Dirtwire\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lucid Dream\nThis is not your traditional Americana. The Carrier is fresh and modern with a vibrant, dirty sound that lives up to the band\u2019s name. Their unique perspective on Americana often features influences from Eastern, African, and South American music threaded throughout. Comprised of David Satori (Beats Antique), Evan Fraser (Hamsa Lila; Bolo), and Mark Reveley (Jed and Lucia), the band describes their music as \u201ca rebirth of Americana and a post-millennial psychedelic journey to downhome goodness.\u201d\nNo two songs are quite alike on this almost exclusively instrumental album. From \u201cThe Well,\u201d featuring Rising Appalachia, to the aptly named \u201cLast Call,\u201d with its sleepy afternoon vibe, The Carrier invites listeners to dive deep into a world with truth and whimsical fancy married together in happy harmony.\n\nBest Of Old Crow Medicine Show by Old Crow Medicine Show\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Huckleberry\nBest Of Old Crow Medicine Show starts off with \u201cWagon Wheel,\u201d a song co-written with Bob Dylan. He first developed the chorus in 1973, 25 years before Old Crow Medicine Show added verses and finalized the song. The classic, like much of Old Crow Medicine Show\u2019s music, tells a lyrical story that is set to a distinctly old-timey country-bluegrass-folk sound.\nOCMS features guitar, banjo, standup bass, fiddle, harmonica, mandolin, drums, and keys, among many other instruments. The result of so much instrumental combination is a wonderfully rich, full sound that is as fanciful as it is familiar. Best Of Old Crown Medicine Show is a farmer on a front porch, a half-empty whiskey bottle, dusty boots, and sunflower fields for miles. It would be a challenge to listen to it without cracking a smile.\nCaptain Nowhere by Railroad Earth\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lemon Drop\nCaptain Nowhere is beautiful, heartfelt, and earthy. The album combines elements of folk, roots, country, bluegrass, and even jazz to create an Americana sound with a life of its own. Todd Sheaffer\u2019s vocals, together with the album\u2019s lyricism, evoke nostalgia, emotion, and at times yearning, which together paint Captain Nowhere\u2019s unique soundscape with true-to-life human elements.\nKnown for improvisation, Railroad Earth\u2019s jam band version of Americana brings a fresh take to the genre, as seen in their song \u201cThe Berkley Flash,\u201d which delves into instrumentation that breathes and moves like white clouds on a windy day. All in all, Captain Nowhere leads the listener across vast waters of roots sound that will delight, uplift, and inspire\u2014just like its strain pairing.\n\nWider Circles by Rising Appalachia\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Blue Mystic\nWider Circles is ethereal, light, heartfelt, and raw. Multi-instrumentalist sister duo Leah and Chloe Smith combine their unique sound with strong, harmonious vocals and creative, original lyrics. Wider Circles blends all these talents beautifully, as the album leads the listener down a gentle river of sound that flows softly together even as it twists and turns along the way.\nWorking in conjunction with an array of fellow musicians, the Smith sisters are able to incorporate a wide range of instruments including (but not limited to) banjos, fiddles, drums, congas, djembe, tablas, and even a washboard. The result is music that is folksy yet worldly and filled to the brim with life. Wider Circles will inspire, delight, and encourage movement of both body and mind.",

After the first bong hit, I almost instantly felt a sensation of tingling and numbness at the same time in my fingers, the same feeling of being given strong pain medication intravenously. After the second hit, a strong headhigh kicked in almost instantly. I felt a tingling sensation at the top of my head.\n As I walked in to my livingroom, everything seemed very surreal. Then, as I was prepearing some food in my kitchen, a song on TV made me think that I was prepearing a meal in a spacestation. After about 15 minutes, it REALLY kicked in, and my heart was racing so fast it felt like it was just vibrating, and I became paranoid. (I underestimated how potent is was) I managed to calm down and then it was just pure pleasure from head to toe! I My thoughts went on a spacy journey. Very euphoric, and a bit hallusinogenic! My backpain was just gone, and so was my stress and anxiety. Made sex feel very, very good. I've had some trouble sleeping too, but sleeping was no problem on this strain. Slept trough the whole night. I can't remember even trying to sleep, and woke up with a clear and refreshed mind. \nThe buds are beautiful light green-grey-ish with a lot of amber hairs, and the smell is incredible. Smells like freshly picked blueberries, or blueberry tea!! YUM! Very smooth smoke, not harsh on lungs and throath. Love it!",
