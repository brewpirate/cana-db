This must be the best weed I have ever smoked! After the first bong hit, I almost instantly felt a sensation of tingling and numbness at the same time in my fingers, the same feeling of being given strong pain medication intravenously. After the second hit, a strong headhigh kicked in almost instantly. I felt a tingling sensation at the top of my head.\n As I walked in to my livingroom, everything seemed very surreal. Then, as I was prepearing some food in my kitchen, a song on TV made me think that I was prepearing a meal in a spacestation. After about 15 minutes, it REALLY kicked in, and my heart was racing so fast it felt like it was just vibrating, and I became paranoid. (I underestimated how potent is was) I managed to calm down and then it was just pure pleasure from head to toe! I My thoughts went on a spacy journey. Very euphoric, and a bit hallusinogenic! My backpain was just gone, and so was my stress and anxiety. Made sex feel very, very good. I\u0027ve had some trouble sleeping too, but sleeping was no problem on this strain. Slept trough the whole night. I can\u0027t remember even trying to sleep, and woke up with a clear and refreshed mind. \nThe buds are beautiful light green-grey-ish with a lot of amber hairs, and the smell is incredible.

Starting in the 19th century, blues formed in black communities of the deep south and has strong roots in African musical traditions. Early blues songs were accompanied by lyrics recounting experiences of racial discrimination and other similar hardships faced by black Americans. The genre has persisted through the years, often being combined with elements of jazz, soul, rock, spirituals, and R\u0026B.\n\nWhatever form it takes, the blues is a genre that grabs you by the heart and demands an emotional response. Below, enjoy five impactful blues albums with our recommended strains and tune in to your emotional center.\nSouthern Avenue by Southern Avenue\n(Spotify)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Bluniverse\nSouthern Avenue released its lively self-titled album in 2017 and burst onto the blues scene with a refreshing style.

At its heart, Americana has a deeply rustic feel, and exists at the intersection of some or all of these classic roots genres. It’s the kind of music that paints a grand picture of open country, roaming plains and old American charm.\n\nAmericana is special not only because it acts as the child of so many other beloved genres, but because it exemplifies the blending of the old with the new. It has the capacity to uplift and energize while spilling over with honest emotion, creating a sound that is both deeply human and largely joyful. We recommend gathering your favorite people, rolling a fat joint, and exploring the following Americana albums as you nestle into an elevated state of mind.\nLeaving Eden by Carolina Chocolate Drops\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Blueberry Pie\nLeaving Eden is at once up-on-your-feet, slap-your-knee, circle-swinging-dance music. But in the next breath it is also soft, heartfelt and gentle. This album can make you feel like you’re stepping back in time to rediscover the quintessential idea of old folk roots music—as with the song “Boodle-De-Bum-Bum”—but the very next song “Country Girl” will yank you out of the reverie and thrust you into the present with its upbeat, modern vibes and vocals. The title track “Leaving Eden” encourages reflection and a release of emotion with its gentle purring.\nCarolina Chocolate Drops is comprised of Hubby Jenkins, Rowan Corbett, Malcolm Parson, and Rhiannon Giddens, with Giddens’ powerful yet delicate vocals often at the forefront of their sound. Between the four of them is a wide variety of instrumentation including guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle, kazoo, drum, djembe, and cello. This album has a full, intricate sound that shifts and changes with each track, allowing it to hold its listener’s attention effortlessly.\nThe Carrier by Dirtwire\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lucid Dream\nThis is not your traditional Americana. The Carrier is fresh and modern with a vibrant, dirty sound that lives up to the band’s name. Their unique perspective on Americana often features influences from Eastern, African, and South American music threaded throughout. Comprised of David Satori (Beats Antique), Evan Fraser (Hamsa Lila; Bolo), and Mark Reveley (Jed and Lucia), the band describes their music as “a rebirth of Americana and a post-millennial psychedelic journey to downhome goodness.”\nNo two songs are quite alike on this almost exclusively instrumental album. From “The Well,” featuring Rising Appalachia, to the aptly named “Last Call,” with its sleepy afternoon vibe, The Carrier invites listeners to dive deep into a world with truth and whimsical fancy married together in happy harmony.\n\nBest Of Old Crow Medicine Show by Old Crow Medicine Show\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Huckleberry\nBest Of Old Crow Medicine Show starts off with “Wagon Wheel,” a song co-written with Bob Dylan. He first developed the chorus in 1973, 25 years before Old Crow Medicine Show added verses and finalized the song. The classic, like much of Old Crow Medicine Show’s music, tells a lyrical story that is set to a distinctly old-timey country-bluegrass-folk sound.\nOCMS features guitar, banjo, standup bass, fiddle, harmonica, mandolin, drums, and keys, among many other instruments. The result of so much instrumental combination is a wonderfully rich, full sound that is as fanciful as it is familiar. Best Of Old Crown Medicine Show is a farmer on a front porch, a half-empty whiskey bottle, dusty boots, and sunflower fields for miles. It would be a challenge to listen to it without cracking a smile.\nCaptain Nowhere by Railroad Earth\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lemon Drop\nCaptain Nowhere is beautiful, heartfelt, and earthy. The album combines elements of folk, roots, country, bluegrass, and even jazz to create an Americana sound with a life of its own. Todd Sheaffer’s vocals, together with the album’s lyricism, evoke nostalgia, emotion, and at times yearning, which together paint Captain Nowhere’s unique soundscape with true-to-life human elements.\nKnown for improvisation, Railroad Earth’s jam band version of Americana brings a fresh take to the genre, as seen in their song “The Berkley Flash,” which delves into instrumentation that breathes and moves like white clouds on a windy day. All in all, Captain Nowhere leads the listener across vast waters of roots sound that will delight, uplift, and inspire—just like its strain pairing.\n\nWider Circles by Rising Appalachia\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Blue Mystic\nWider Circles is ethereal, light, heartfelt, and raw. Multi-instrumentalist sister duo Leah and Chloe Smith combine their unique sound with strong, harmonious vocals and creative, original lyrics. Wider Circles blends all these talents beautifully, as the album leads the listener down a gentle river of sound that flows softly together even as it twists and turns along the way.\nWorking in conjunction with an array of fellow musicians, the Smith sisters are able to incorporate a wide range of instruments including (but not limited to) banjos, fiddles, drums, congas, djembe, tablas, and even a washboard. The result is music that is folksy yet worldly and filled to the brim with life. Wider Circles will inspire, delight, and encourage movement of both body and mind.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24100103/americana-music.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/americana-albums-listen-high"}],"reviewCount":139,"flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","score":42.246835443037973},{"name":"Berry","score":15.50632911392405},{"name":"Earthy","score":15.031645569620252},{"name":"Sweet","score":12.38132911392405},{"name":"Skunk","score":4.3908227848101262}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":80.419303797468359},{"name":"Relaxed","score":77.610759493670884},{"name":"Creative","score":60.996835443037973},{"name":"Energetic","score":41.61392405063291},{"name":"Tingly","score":35.047468354430379}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":13.528481012658228},{"name":"Pain","score":10.996835443037975},{"name":"Insomnia","score":9.7310126582278471},{"name":"Nausea","score":8.6234177215189867},{"name":"Depression","score":8.1882911392405067}],"conditions":[{"name":"Migraines","score":29.865506329113924},{"name":"Anxiety","score":11.787974683544302},{"name":"PTSD","score":4.549050632911392},{"name":"Cancer","score":3.7579113924050631},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":3.7579113924050631}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":38.212025316455694},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":9.4145569620253156},{"name":"Dizzy","score":2.0569620253164556},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.4240506329113924},{"name":"Headache","score":0.79113924050632911}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-mystic_100x100_dc1e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/675372/b/blue-mystic__primary_3805.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-mystic_100x100_e828.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/669197/b/blue-mystic__primary_9124.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-mystic_100x100_4c88.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/601489/b/blue-mystic__primary_6ce0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-mystic_100x100_3c81.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/549962/b/blue-mystic__primary_04ed.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-mystic_100x100_2b61.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/526632/b/blue-mystic__primary_449f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-mystic_100x100_04d4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/519833/b/blue-mystic__primary_3330.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":75,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Anchorage, AK","Detroit, MI","Aberdeen, WA","Astoria, OR","Bellingham, WA","Bothell, WA","Bremerton, WA","Corvallis, OR","Hoquiam, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/blue-mystic","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.22302158273381/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Blueberry","subtitle":null,"slug":"blueberry","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/blueberry","symbol":"Bry","applink":"leafly://strain/blueberry"},{"name":"Northern Lights","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights","symbol":"Nl","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
