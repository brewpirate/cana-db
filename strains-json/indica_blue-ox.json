Smoking this gives you a full bodied high that creeps up on you, and makes you feel a bit clouded. Last for a good 3 hours (or until you doze off).  I enjoyed this!  Doesn\u2019t knock me out every time though, but it really makes me want to create and have sex. No paranoia, anxiety or hallucinations. Solid 5 stars!",
