Chocolate Diesel\n\nChocolate Diesel is a sativa cannabis strain that brings together genetics from the original Sour Diesel and Chocolate Thai.

Blue Power\n\nThe indica-dominant Blue Power is one of Sin City Seeds\u2019 signature strains, bred from Sour Double, Master Kush, The White, and Blue Moonshine genetics. Cherished for its fragrant buds, Blue Power offers a sweet fusion of lemon and berry flavors with an earthy finish.

            "text": "Bright green with heavy crystallization on the outside, break open the nugs to discover the dark blue and purple hues that unlock a very pungent berry aroma. Very sweet and thick smoke, taste of Chem-like properties such as a sharp chemical smell with some sugar tipped aromas that accompany berry, cheese, earthy and sour notes. The taste is just as complex, a plethora of tantalizing terpenes make this strain a connoisseur's dream. The effects take a minute to grip the user, giving some time to grab some snacks and get the Netflix rolling before the full body high sets in. As a veteran smoker I tend to have doubts when I see recreational bud with potency test results in the low 30% range, but this particular batch definitely has a very heavy dosage to it even for someone who is a daily smoker. Overall the appeal of the bud structure and the smells are reasons enough to buy this strain, but the almost narcotic indica effects make it a great medicinal strain as well! Will buy again!  ",
