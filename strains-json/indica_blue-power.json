Cactus Cooler\n\nCactus Cooler is a sativa-dominant strain that’s said to be a cross between Blue Dream and OG Kush. The sativa in Cactus Cooler lends an upbeat cerebral kick to help you stay focused and productive throughout the day, while the OG boosts the senses with buzzing euphoria. With notes of sharp lemon and sweet wildflowers, Cactus Cooler takes after both parents in its fragrance.\n\nCactus Cooler is currently available through Grandma\u0027s Goodies Delivery (medical) in San Francisco, CA and Los Angeles, CA\n \nCheck out our other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or catch up on last week\u0027s New Strains Alert!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/12001958/new-strains-alert-blueberry-jack-hellfire-og-double-tangie-banana.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-blueberry-jack-hellfire-og-double-tangie-banana"}],"reviewCount":51,"flavors":[{"name":"Berry","score":39.48306595365419},{"name":"Earthy","score":38.502673796791449},{"name":"Diesel","score":25},{"name":"Lemon","score":11.051693404634582},{"name":"Flowery","score":10.561497326203209}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":66.622103386809272},{"name":"Happy","score":59.62566844919786},{"name":"Tingly","score":41.0873440285205},{"name":"Focused","score":33.467023172905527},{"name":"Uplifted","score":26.024955436720145}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":45.98930481283422},{"name":"Insomnia","score":39.973262032085564},{"name":"Depression","score":38.502673796791449},{"name":"Nausea","score":31.506238859180037},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":7.4866310160427805}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":22.103386809269164},{"name":"Arthritis","score":9.5811051693404643},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":6.0160427807486636},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":6.0160427807486636},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":5.525846702317291}],"negatives":[{"name":"Headache","score":31.016042780748663},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":2.9411764705882351},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.9607843137254901},{"name":"Paranoid","score":0.49019607843137253}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-power_100x100_763b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/600252/b/blue-power__primary_a538.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-power_100x100_6f20.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/562320/b/blue-power__primary_9bdc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-power_100x100_4e5c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/562319/b/blue-power__primary_ce0c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-power_100x100_071a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/562260/b/blue-power__primary_dd03.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-power_100x100_c193.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/562318/b/blue-power__primary_2618.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blue-power_100x100_214f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/553040/b/blue-power__primary_5567.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":13,"popularCities":["Everett, WA","Spokane, WA","Vancouver, WA","Arlington, WA","Mount Vernon, WA","Renton, WA","Bothell, WA","Buckley, WA","Colorado Springs, CO","Des Moines, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/blue-power","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.54901960784314/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Master Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"master-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/master-kush","symbol":"Mks","applink":"leafly://strain/master-kush"},{"name":"The White","subtitle":null,"slug":"the-white","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/the-white","symbol":"Twt","applink":"leafly://strain/the-white"},{"name":"Blue Moonshine","subtitle":null,"slug":"blue-moonshine","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/blue-moonshine","symbol":"Blm","applink":"leafly://strain/blue-moonshine"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tYields about 250-400 grams per square meter\n\n"}}
