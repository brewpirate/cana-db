Head effects are pleasant--euphoric but controlled--and fairly short lived, fading from head to body after only two hours or so.    Body high is relaxing, without much dry mouth or eye redness.  Uncharacteristically for an indica-dominant hybrid, this strain didn't put me to sleep as it tailed off, which was nice.  This would be a good choice for when you're going to be around muggles but you still want to get your swerve on.",
