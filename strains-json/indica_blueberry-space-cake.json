            "text": "Blueberry Space Cake is. CRESO HOME RUN!!!!!\nThis is in there RESERVE collection along wi5 other flavors like Holiet Jake etc.\nBlueberry Space Cake is one of those strains that IF you,re lucky to find it BUY IT....or I WILL WHEN I FIND IT!!!\nI suffer from neuro pain in spine in arms. Legs, ribs back, have had 18 heart procedures n heart attacks so let\u2019s just say I need to be calm and try to find some good in what she been a horrible 20 years.\nThis strain similar to BLUEBERRY has a little more control, u can take two boats, loose. That anxiety n your cool, or maybe it was a BAD DAY....ya got a headache, back hurts take a shower get in bed n just nurse this like a kid with a BLOW POP! \n\nbefore ya know it.....you\u2019re OK.....it is a bit more expensive for thE CRESCO RESERVES but IMO worth it....not always about THC content, fresh terpenes, etc make for a wonderful fresh tasting concentrate!\n\nif ya see this again I suggest you pick it up.....cause if I find it, I\u2019ll buy it......strains like those ARE equal to an OPIOD just more expensive...but who cares, it\u2019s our money!    \n\nFinally us children of the WOODSTOCK GENERATION HAVE A CHOICE AND A VOICE!!!!\n\nEnjoy this....thanks CRESCO \nVoodoo Idol",
