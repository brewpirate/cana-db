I was able to focus and get things done without feeling stress and had a smile on my face. Would have rated 4 stars but the way it hit me was very random. About instantly after smoking I felt it but it wasn\u0027t until like 30 minutes later that it hit again but totally different and stronger, I felt a good head high that shouldn\u0027t of been there as an indica. It was a short, weird experience that only lasted 5 minutes or so but overall a great high. Has a sweet, earthy aroma and spicy earthy taste.

Prune it well to push the bud development up and keep from having too many bud sites, which otherwise will be far too many and small. Gave about 80g in 18 weeks, with wonderful trim for butter.  Excellent medical plant.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Pl-Y2_w7iIfXMq-susdCw64Abdk=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fZFL3vk8uSMmuki8G4w8c_old-school-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":2,"flavors":[{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":50},{"name":"Sweet","score":50},{"name":"Earthy","score":50},{"name":"Skunk","score":50}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":100},{"name":"Sleepy","score":50},{"name":"Talkative","score":50},{"name":"Uplifted","score":50},{"name":"Energetic","score":50}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Insomnia","score":50},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":50},{"name":"Pain","score":50}],"conditions":[{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":50},{"name":"Tinnitus","score":50}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dizzy","score":50},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":50},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":50}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/bona-dea","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3.5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
