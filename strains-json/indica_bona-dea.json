About instantly after smoking I felt it but it wasn't until like 30 minutes later that it hit again but totally different and stronger, I felt a good head high that shouldn't of been there as an indica. It was a short, weird experience that only lasted 5 minutes or so but overall a great high. Has a sweet, earthy aroma and spicy earthy taste.  ",

Prune it well to push the bud development up and keep from having too many bud sites, which otherwise will be far too many and small. Gave about 80g in 18 weeks, with wonderful trim for butter.  Excellent medical plant.",
