Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sYyCvG278&feature=youtu.be\nStrain Overview: A descendant of OG Kush and another indica-dominant strain, Bubba Kush is known for its knockout potency. It delivers hash, chocolate, and coffee flavor profiles with effects that leave you in a tranquil state of bliss. This strain grows short and fat with large dense buds, speaking to its Afghani lineage.\nGrow Techniques: Bubba Kush is a\u00a0great strain for hydroponic growers as the plants stay short and dense, growing beautiful trichome-covered buds. Pack them in closely and prune their lower branches to develop a beautiful SOG (sea of green). Top your crop to create full, even canopies in your garden.\nFlowering Time: 8-9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Moderate and dry climates falling between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Often preferred for indoor grows because its large dense buds will suffer quickly in moist climates.\nFeeding: Bubba Kush is a heavy feeder. Its dense growth requires lots of nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium to fully develop before flowering.",

A moderate dose results in a feeling just short of couchlock, allowing you to stay mobile, but at the same time making you chair feel insanely comftorable. The high left me clear headed, I was able to respond well and carry on an intelligetnt conversation. At the same time i was also able to enjoy the music that was playing.\r\n\r\nThis weed did not make me introspective or deep in thought like smoking usualy does, however during the high i found myself 'living in the moment' and enjoying the little things in life.\r\n\r\nVery relaxing, and the high lasted 2+ hours and ended with a great nights sleep",
