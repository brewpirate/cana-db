Leafly and Botanicare are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sYyCvG278\u0026feature=youtu.be\nStrain Overview: A descendant of OG Kush and another indica-dominant strain, Bubba Kush is known for its knockout potency. It delivers hash, chocolate, and coffee flavor profiles with effects that leave you in a tranquil state of bliss. This strain grows short and fat with large dense buds, speaking to its Afghani lineage.\nGrow Techniques: Bubba Kush is a great strain for hydroponic growers as the plants stay short and dense, growing beautiful trichome-covered buds. Pack them in closely and prune their lower branches to develop a beautiful SOG (sea of green). Top your crop to create full, even canopies in your garden.\nFlowering Time: 8-9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Moderate and dry climates falling between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Often preferred for indoor grows because its large dense buds will suffer quickly in moist climates.\nFeeding: Bubba Kush is a heavy feeder. Its dense growth requires lots of nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium to fully develop before flowering.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21163216/bubba-kush-cannabis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-bubba-kush-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":2841,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":24.748849309585754},{"name":"Sweet","score":16.166700020012009},{"name":"Woody","score":12.456473884330597},{"name":"Flowery","score":10.969295863232224},{"name":"Pungent","score":10.018296692301094}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":76.437719774721984},{"name":"Happy","score":49.32845421538638},{"name":"Sleepy","score":47.754652791675},{"name":"Euphoric","score":41.957674604762857},{"name":"Hungry","score":34.346893850596075}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":33.032533805997886},{"name":"Insomnia","score":31.518411046627978},{"name":"Pain","score":25.727079104605622},{"name":"Depression","score":23.525543897767232},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":12.000414534434947}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":32.008204922953773},{"name":"Migraines","score":10.403670773892907},{"name":"PTSD","score":9.9606907001343661},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":7.2637868435346924},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":6.1193859172646441}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":36.354312587552528},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":13.786128820149234},{"name":"Dizzy","score":9.5081334514994715},{"name":"Headache","score":4.6373538408759547},{"name":"Paranoid","score":4.1805797764372912}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/indica/bubba-kush/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/indica/bubba-kush/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bubba-kush_100x100_b126.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1016512/b/bubba-kush__primary_076e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bubba-kush_100x100_1a39.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1003042/b/bubba-kush__primary_bf1b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bubba-kush_100x100_f6b8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002336/b/bubba-kush__primary_43c3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bubba-kush_100x100_bd1b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000934/b/bubba-kush__primary_d99e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bubba-kush_100x100_71dc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000834/b/bubba-kush__primary_bebc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/bubba-kush_100x100_af78.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/675309/b/bubba-kush__primary_c2af.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":960,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Denver, CO","Seattle, WA","Toronto, ON","Vancouver, BC","Phoenix, AZ","Montréal, QC","Calgary, AB","Salem, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/bubba-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.30799014431538/240","testGraph":"https://leafly.s3.amazonaws.com/strains/testing/yfAhlOkR5iSnSTNKgf4s_bubba-kush.png","weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":"End of October","height":"Short","averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tWell suited for sea of green (SOG)\n\tYields typically reach up to 430g/m\u0026sup2;\n\tCan exhibit many different indica phenotypes\n\n"}}
