Great for daytime to relax you in small moderation though. Best for nighttime great to help with insomnia ptsd depression anxiety. Great Earthy woodsy smell \u0026 taste. Leaves an awesome smell behind when done smoking similar to incense smell awesome!!! Not super strong but does the trick and will couch/bed lock you if u over do it. Great overall indica that can be used during day in moderation. üëç","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1624556,"username":"HybridNoisebloom","text":"One of my favorite indicas due to how versatile it is. It works absolutely well for both trouble falling/staying asleep as well as PTSD nightmares, not to mention it makes me more giggly. It even works well in small doses in the morning/afternoon to take stress off (even if it won\u0027t help focus you or energize you). It tastes great and has a nice aftertaste to it too, plus the smell (in my experience) isn\u0027t overwhelming or strong that, with proper precautions, no one else aside from you should be able to smell it that easily. The only downside (which I don\u0027t consider it to be much of one at all) is that the more high off this you get, the harder it is to talk to people or keep up with something someone is saying. Found that out the hard way saying good night to my girlfriend for a couple of nights.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/U9D6jRktbp0tD6kTLBLje6iBugM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net%2f4aMMaTf4eqcYvcOQcRejbsRjdIk%3d%2f120x120%2fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Fleafly-images%252Fuser-profile%252FKoThq07WS0GFpjLzLOmF_Dango.(CLANNAD).full.113863.jpg.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":120,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":56.326081326081322},{"name":"Sweet","score":52.272727272727273},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":52.2015022015022},{"name":"Woody","score":26.223776223776223},{"name":"Pine","score":2.9008029008029004}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":108.58585858585859},{"name":"Sleepy","score":98.3100233100233},{"name":"Happy","score":69.153069153069154},{"name":"Uplifted","score":44.431494431494428},{"name":"Giggly","score":28.949753949753948}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":67.754467754467754},{"name":"Stress","score":67.47604247604248},{"name":"Insomnia","score":62.826987826987825},{"name":"Depression","score":59.576534576534577},{"name":"Headaches","score":55.976430976430976}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":68.1041181041181},{"name":"PTSD","score":52.9008029008029},{"name":"Epilepsy","score":25.174825174825173},{"name":"Migraines","score":4.7526547526547525},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":3.8785288785288783}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":64.15436415436416},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":35.554260554260551},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.7259777259777258},{"name":"Dizzy","score":2.5511525511525508},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.2015022015022012}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/buddha-s-sister_100x100_ae98.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/505666/b/buddha-s-sister__primary_8708.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/buddha-s-sister_100x100_6645.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/506167/b/buddha-s-sister__primary_6c23.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/buddha-s-sister_100x100_4240.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/505133/b/buddha-s-sister__primary_cb9f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/buddha-s-sister_100x100_5ea2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494368/b/buddha-s-sister__primary_d5f3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/buddha-s-sister_100x100_9df5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/438410/b/buddha-s-sister__primary_e864.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/buddha-s-sister_100x100_fff6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/412496/b/buddha-s-sister__primary_dd01.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":25,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Colorado Springs, CO","Ayer, MA","Bellevue, WA","Brookline, MA","Denver, CO","Dundee, OR","Idaho Springs, CO","Madras, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/buddhas-sister","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.34166666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afghan Hawaiian","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghan-hawaiian","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghan-hawaiian","symbol":"Ahi","applink":"leafly://strain/afghan-hawaiian"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
