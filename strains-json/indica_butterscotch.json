The high is very relaxing and a great sleep-inducer. Classical indica mind-calmer as well, which is great for those who are prone to monkey-mindedness and need something to quiet it down. The body buzz isn't as strong as some other indicas, and exists mostly as a pleasant pressure in the chest. ",

This is the strongest bud I have ever smoked.  Very strong euphoria without the pananoia and anxiety I used to get off strong weed. After an hour the indica effect kicked in and I was out like a light. I woke up with no grogginess whatsoever and felt completely refreshed.  Strongly recommended! ",
