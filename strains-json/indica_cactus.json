Traditionally, the most important element of the evening has been the sparkling wine for a midnight toast. Bringing cannabis into the mix this year is the perfect way to celebrate everything the legalization movement has achieved in 2016, and the delectable pairing virtually guarantees a feel-good start to 2017.\nHow to go about pairing bud with your bubbly? As with any wine pairing, you\u2019ll want to be aware of how the cannabis\u2019s tasting notes will complement those of your sparkling wine. You\u2019ll also want to take into account the effects of the strain you choose \u2014 steer clear of anything that might cause you to nod off before midnight!\nWhile everyone\u2019s preferences will vary slightly, read on for four\u00a0pairing ideas to end the year on a high note.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re drinking cava\u2026\n\nWine to try: Can Maci\u00e0 Bohigas Cava Brut Penedes ($15, K&L Wine Merchants)\n\u00a0\nStrain to try: Outer Space\nA\u00a0style of sparkling wine that has made great gains in popularity of late, cava is Spain\u2019s signature sparkler. This particular iteration from Can Maci\u00e0 reveals crisp apple and sweet pear notes upon popping the cork. For a full range of holiday fruit flavors, pair with a cherry- and berry-flavored sativa like Outer Space. Its cheery, chatty aftereffects are an excellent added bonus.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re drinking sparkling ros\u00e9\u2026\n\nWine to try: Argyle Winery 2012 Brut Ros\u00e9 ($50, Argyle Winery)\n\u00a0\nStrain to try: Tangerine Dream\nLooking to sip outside the box this year? Switch out the classic golden bubbles for something a little pinker: sparkling ros\u00e9. This particular bottling is a bit spendy at $50, but Argyle\u2019s Brut Ros\u00e9 has also been served at White House dinners by two different presidential administrations, so you know it\u2019s worth the splurge. Pair it with an equally highly regarded hybrid like the appetizing, award-winning Tangerine Dream.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re drinking brut\u2026\n\nWine to try: NV Mumm Napa Brut Prestige ($18, BevMo!)\n\u00a0\nStrain to try: Cactus\nOn the dry end of the sparkling wine spectrum, a brut classification indicates that your bottle of sparkling wine contains hardly any residual sugar. This lets the grapes\u2019 naturally occurring flavor notes shine through. Pair with a relaxed yet chatty indica like Cactus; if big parties aren\u2019t always your cup of tea, an anxiety-quelling strain like this one is a great way to go.\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re drinking demi-sec\u2026\n\nWine to try: Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec ($31, Total Wine)\n\u00a0\nStrain to try: Laughing Buddha\nToward the other end of sparkling wine\u2019s sweetness spectrum lie demi-sec Champagnes, which maintain more residual sugar than their drier brut cousins. To offset this sweetness, match a demi-sec wine with the herbal, earthy aromas and giggly, feel-good effects of a sativa like Laughing Buddha. What better way to go into the new year than with a smile on your face?\n\n\nImage Sources: Argyle Winery, Total Wine, Bevmo!, KL Wines, Michael Mina Wine Club",

In fact, I am usually one step further; nighttime after I have absolutely no chance of having to do anything else.  \n\nThis is where Cactus rises above other indicas and hybrids.  In fact Cactus shines.  If I vape just a couple of long hits I can smoke this in the morning and be creative, alert, personable and on my game.  I have had more than one client comment that  I seem sharp. \n\nIf I am in the mood for the vice grip my couch provides,  burning a little more leads to a very tranquil yet alert television viewing state.  More than once I have figured out the tv show Lost, only to forget the next day.  \n\nThe most important factor in my reviews is pain relief.  This is the best pain management strain I have ever felt.   I encourage anyone who is hurting to give this a try.",
