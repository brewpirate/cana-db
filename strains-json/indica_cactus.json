Bringing cannabis into the mix this year is the perfect way to celebrate everything the legalization movement has achieved in 2016, and the delectable pairing virtually guarantees a feel-good start to 2017.\nHow to go about pairing bud with your bubbly? As with any wine pairing, you’ll want to be aware of how the cannabis’s tasting notes will complement those of your sparkling wine. You’ll also want to take into account the effects of the strain you choose — steer clear of anything that might cause you to nod off before midnight!\nWhile everyone’s preferences will vary slightly, read on for four pairing ideas to end the year on a high note.\n \nIf you’re drinking cava…\n\nWine to try: Can Macià Bohigas Cava Brut Penedes ($15, K\u0026L Wine Merchants)\n \nStrain to try: Outer Space\nA style of sparkling wine that has made great gains in popularity of late, cava is Spain’s signature sparkler. This particular iteration from Can Macià reveals crisp apple and sweet pear notes upon popping the cork. For a full range of holiday fruit flavors, pair with a cherry- and berry-flavored sativa like Outer Space. Its cheery, chatty aftereffects are an excellent added bonus.\n \nIf you’re drinking sparkling rosé…\n\nWine to try: Argyle Winery 2012 Brut Rosé ($50, Argyle Winery)\n \nStrain to try: Tangerine Dream\nLooking to sip outside the box this year? Switch out the classic golden bubbles for something a little pinker: sparkling rosé. This particular bottling is a bit spendy at $50, but Argyle’s Brut Rosé has also been served at White House dinners by two different presidential administrations, so you know it’s worth the splurge. Pair it with an equally highly regarded hybrid like the appetizing, award-winning Tangerine Dream.\n \nIf you’re drinking brut…\n\nWine to try: NV Mumm Napa Brut Prestige ($18, BevMo!)\n \nStrain to try: Cactus\nOn the dry end of the sparkling wine spectrum, a brut classification indicates that your bottle of sparkling wine contains hardly any residual sugar. This lets the grapes’ naturally occurring flavor notes shine through. Pair with a relaxed yet chatty indica like Cactus; if big parties aren’t always your cup of tea, an anxiety-quelling strain like this one is a great way to go.\n \nIf you’re drinking demi-sec…\n\nWine to try: Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec ($31, Total Wine)\n \nStrain to try: Laughing Buddha\nToward the other end of sparkling wine’s sweetness spectrum lie demi-sec Champagnes, which maintain more residual sugar than their drier brut cousins. To offset this sweetness, match a demi-sec wine with the herbal, earthy aromas and giggly, feel-good effects of a sativa like Laughing Buddha.

We\u0027d like to introduce you to a few varieties recently added to the Leafly Explorer, and if you like the sound of any of these, check the links to see if any are available near you.\nRemember, if you do have a chance to try one of these newly added strains, give \u0027em a review. Happy strain hunting!\n \n 1. Blueberry Jack\n\nA cross between the legendary Jack Herer and DJ Short Blueberry, Blueberry Jack has something special to offer in both flavor and effect. Sweet, candied blueberry flavors invade on the inhale while the earthy, piney exhale reminds you of this strain’s Jack heritage. A lively sativa buzz typically dominates Blueberry Jack’s effect profile, with just enough physical relaxation to keep you grounded. Blueberry Jack offers an easy escape from stress and bad moods, keeping you positive and motivated through the day.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Blueberry Jack\n \n 2. Crouching Tiger Hidden Alien\n\nCrouching Tiger Hidden Alien is another indica staple from Exotic Genetix, who combined Tiger’s Milk with Starfighter to create this powerhouse strain. Flavors of pine and spice come through on the inhale while ushering in full-body tranquility. Its heavy-handed sedation makes Crouching Tiger Hidden Alien a perfect choice for sleepless nights or for getting rest and relaxation.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Crouching Tiger Hidden Alien\n \n 3. Double Tangie Banana\n\nDouble Tangie Banana is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain developed by Crockett Family Farms. Supposedly a cross between Banana Sherbert and DNA Genetics’ orange-flavored Tangie, Double Tangie Banana oozes with crystal resin and citrus aromas. Anyone who has tried Tangie knows that this strain was primarily bred for the flavor enthusiasts, so if you’re searching for a strain with an impressive terpene profile, look no further.\n\n \n \n 4. Chocolate Diesel\n\nChocolate Diesel is a sativa cannabis strain that brings together genetics from the original Sour Diesel and Chocolate Thai. With soaring euphoria that shoots straight to the head, Chocolate Diesel could easily be compared to a cup of coffee. Its flavors offer a little part of both parents, with notes of both earthy chocolate and skunky diesel.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Chocolate Diesel\n \n 5. Hellfire OG\n\nHellfire OG is a California hybrid strain that crosses Rascal’s OG Kush with SFV OG Kush. Another robust and powerfully euphoric addition to the OG family tree, Hellfire OG is the perfect THC powerhouse for the cannabis veteran or the patient needing potent relief. In a show of its genetic line, Hellfire OG carries that signature OG smell of lemon diesel and earthy spice.\n\nHellfire OG is currently available at Green Door (medical) in San Francisco, CA\n \n 6. Blue Power\n\nThe indica-dominant Blue Power is one of Sin City Seeds’ signature strains, bred from Sour Double, Master Kush, The White, and Blue Moonshine genetics. Cherished for its fragrant buds, Blue Power offers a sweet fusion of lemon and berry flavors with an earthy finish. It should be noted that another genetic variation released by Vision Seeds crosses Blueberry, White Widow, and Skunk #1. This rendition is described as a happy and uplifting indica that helps focus the mind while fighting stress.\n\nBlue Power is currently available at Jackson County Compassion Club (medical) in Jackson, MI\n \n 7. Cactus Cooler\n\nCactus Cooler is a sativa-dominant strain that’s said to be a cross between Blue Dream and OG Kush. The sativa in Cactus Cooler lends an upbeat cerebral kick to help you stay focused and productive throughout the day, while the OG boosts the senses with buzzing euphoria. With notes of sharp lemon and sweet wildflowers, Cactus Cooler takes after both parents in its fragrance.\n\nCactus Cooler is currently available through Grandma\u0027s Goodies Delivery (medical) in San Francisco, CA and Los Angeles, CA\n \nCheck out our other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or catch up on last week\u0027s New Strains Alert!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/12001958/new-strains-alert-blueberry-jack-hellfire-og-double-tangie-banana.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-blueberry-jack-hellfire-og-double-tangie-banana"}],"reviewCount":96,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":25.582329317269075},{"name":"Citrus","score":16.693440428380185},{"name":"Pungent","score":11.900937081659974},{"name":"Diesel","score":11.111111111111111},{"name":"Woody","score":10.093708165997324}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":103.01874163319947},{"name":"Euphoric","score":92.78447121820615},{"name":"Happy","score":73.688085676037488},{"name":"Hungry","score":52.503346720214196},{"name":"Aroused","score":36.807228915662641}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":35.401606425702809},{"name":"Insomnia","score":25.281124497991964},{"name":"Stress","score":25.006693440428378},{"name":"Depression","score":19.866131191432395},{"name":"Headaches","score":18.821954484605087}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":15.977242302543507},{"name":"PTSD","score":14.631860776439089},{"name":"Anorexia","score":7.2222222222222223},{"name":"Migraines","score":7.0615796519410976},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":6.45917001338688}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":19.725568942436411},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":10.997322623828648},{"name":"Dizzy","score":8.4270414993306559},{"name":"Paranoid","score":8.4270414993306559},{"name":"Anxious","score":5.5555555555555554}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cactus_100x100_0a8f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/442096/b/cactus__primary_37ab.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cactus_100x100_18ce.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/373637/b/cactus__primary_60cb.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cactus_100x100_933d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/245486/b/cactus__primary_583d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/Cactus_100x100_4vfipfyg.bk4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/2414/b/cactus_825x550_uqejymlz.s3a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/Cactus_100x100_5aanbqt0.aiy.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/2325/b/cactus_825x550_uwaywqqi.c5u.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":5,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Beaverton, OR","Tucson, AZ","Vancouver, BC","Bend, OR","Bothell, WA","Chandler, AZ","Cook, WA","Detroit, MI","Ellensburg, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/cactus","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.65625/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Northern Lights","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights","symbol":"Nl","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights"},{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

And we’re guessing your party planning is already in full swing. Traditionally, the most important element of the evening has been the sparkling wine for a midnight toast. Bringing cannabis into the mix this year is the perfect way to celebrate everything the legalization movement has achieved in 2016, and the delectable pairing virtually guarantees a feel-good start to 2017.\nHow to go about pairing bud with your bubbly? As with any wine pairing, you’ll want to be aware of how the cannabis’s tasting notes will complement those of your sparkling wine. You’ll also want to take into account the effects of the strain you choose — steer clear of anything that might cause you to nod off before midnight!\nWhile everyone’s preferences will vary slightly, read on for four pairing ideas to end the year on a high note.\n \nIf you’re drinking cava…\n\nWine to try: Can Macià Bohigas Cava Brut Penedes ($15, K\u0026L Wine Merchants)\n \nStrain to try: Outer Space\nA style of sparkling wine that has made great gains in popularity of late, cava is Spain’s signature sparkler. This particular iteration from Can Macià reveals crisp apple and sweet pear notes upon popping the cork. For a full range of holiday fruit flavors, pair with a cherry- and berry-flavored sativa like Outer Space. Its cheery, chatty aftereffects are an excellent added bonus.\n \nIf you’re drinking sparkling rosé…\n\nWine to try: Argyle Winery 2012 Brut Rosé ($50, Argyle Winery)\n \nStrain to try: Tangerine Dream\nLooking to sip outside the box this year? Switch out the classic golden bubbles for something a little pinker: sparkling rosé. This particular bottling is a bit spendy at $50, but Argyle’s Brut Rosé has also been served at White House dinners by two different presidential administrations, so you know it’s worth the splurge. Pair it with an equally highly regarded hybrid like the appetizing, award-winning Tangerine Dream.\n \nIf you’re drinking brut…\n\nWine to try: NV Mumm Napa Brut Prestige ($18, BevMo!)\n \nStrain to try: Cactus\nOn the dry end of the sparkling wine spectrum, a brut classification indicates that your bottle of sparkling wine contains hardly any residual sugar. This lets the grapes’ naturally occurring flavor notes shine through. Pair with a relaxed yet chatty indica like Cactus; if big parties aren’t always your cup of tea, an anxiety-quelling strain like this one is a great way to go.\n \nIf you’re drinking demi-sec…\n\nWine to try: Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec ($31, Total Wine)\n \nStrain to try: Laughing Buddha\nToward the other end of sparkling wine’s sweetness spectrum lie demi-sec Champagnes, which maintain more residual sugar than their drier brut cousins. To offset this sweetness, match a demi-sec wine with the herbal, earthy aromas and giggly, feel-good effects of a sativa like Laughing Buddha.

With notes of sharp lemon and sweet wildflowers, Cactus Cooler takes after both parents in its fragrance.\n\nCactus Cooler is currently available through Grandma\u0027s Goodies Delivery (medical) in San Francisco, CA and Los Angeles, CA\n \nCheck out our other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or catch up on last week\u0027s New Strains Alert!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/12001958/new-strains-alert-blueberry-jack-hellfire-og-double-tangie-banana.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-blueberry-jack-hellfire-og-double-tangie-banana"}],"reviewCount":96,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":25.582329317269075},{"name":"Citrus","score":16.693440428380185},{"name":"Pungent","score":11.900937081659974},{"name":"Diesel","score":11.111111111111111},{"name":"Woody","score":10.093708165997324}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":103.01874163319947},{"name":"Euphoric","score":92.78447121820615},{"name":"Happy","score":73.688085676037488},{"name":"Hungry","score":52.503346720214196},{"name":"Aroused","score":36.807228915662641}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":35.401606425702809},{"name":"Insomnia","score":25.281124497991964},{"name":"Stress","score":25.006693440428378},{"name":"Depression","score":19.866131191432395},{"name":"Headaches","score":18.821954484605087}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":15.977242302543507},{"name":"PTSD","score":14.631860776439089},{"name":"Anorexia","score":7.2222222222222223},{"name":"Migraines","score":7.0615796519410976},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":6.45917001338688}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":19.725568942436411},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":10.997322623828648},{"name":"Dizzy","score":8.4270414993306559},{"name":"Paranoid","score":8.4270414993306559},{"name":"Anxious","score":5.5555555555555554}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cactus_100x100_0a8f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/442096/b/cactus__primary_37ab.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cactus_100x100_18ce.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/373637/b/cactus__primary_60cb.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cactus_100x100_933d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/245486/b/cactus__primary_583d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/Cactus_100x100_4vfipfyg.bk4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/2414/b/cactus_825x550_uqejymlz.s3a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/Cactus_100x100_5aanbqt0.aiy.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/2325/b/cactus_825x550_uwaywqqi.c5u.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":5,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Beaverton, OR","Tucson, AZ","Vancouver, BC","Bend, OR","Bothell, WA","Chandler, AZ","Cook, WA","Detroit, MI","Ellensburg, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/cactus","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.65625/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Northern Lights","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights","symbol":"Nl","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights"},{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
