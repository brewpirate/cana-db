Sometimes, however, strains can surprise us and exhibit traits that we wouldn’t normally associate with their indica or sativa types.\n\nCannabis strains are more variable than one might think. Their nuanced effects often transcend the basic indica-sativa classification system and are influenced by a number of other factors:\n\nYour personal physiology and brain chemistry\nYour mood and energy level\nHow the strain was grown and which genetic traits that particular plant expressed (cannabis nerds, see this primer on genotypes and phenotypes)\nDelivery method and dose\nExpectation of effects\nAccuracy of strain labeling\n\nWith that caveat in mind, we analyzed our user-submitted strain reviews to find five indica strains that can defy their sedating stereotypes and offer more uplifting effects commonly associated with sativa varieties. Granted, I wouldn’t expect a hyperactive burst of energy from these strains, but sativa fans can certainly appreciate the creative, focused, and social cerebral effects these five have to offer.\n\n1. Purple Chemdawg\n \nChemdawg is known for its jolt of cerebral energy, but what happens when you crossbreed it with Purple Kush? According to Leafly reviewers, that invigorating buzz remains intact but is balanced by calming body sensations that keep you relaxed while your mind takes flight.\n\n“Incredibly unique strain. I’ve never felt so stuck but completely awake and alert.”\n2. Somango\n \nThough mostly indica, Somango has several qualities that any sativa fan can appreciate: focus, creativity, and a tropical flavor profile rarely found in indica varieties. Its Jack Herer parent is partially responsible for that extra cerebral kick, and Somango can also express high levels of CBD which lends to this strain’s clear-headed effects. Somango is a great companion strain for anyone needing to keep their mind sharp while pushing out pain, inflammation, or muscle spasms.\n\n“Keeps me creative, focused and full of ideas for activities like drawing, compose music, etc.”\n3. Alien Dawg\n \nAs with most strains, the reported effects of Alien Dawg range from “I can totally function on this” to “I am plastered to a couch in space.” Keeping the dose moderate is the best way to bring out the balance in this strain as it gives rise to concentrated creativity and positive moods. You’ll also find its cerebral-focused effects are most easily harnessed earlier in the day, while you still have energy for this indica to build off of.\n\n“Works well for anxiety but by no means was I a couch potato on it. I got energetic from it was able to get my stuff done.”\n\n“It is one of the few ‘sativa’ indicas in that is produces noticeable head effects while still having similar body loads of an indica.”\n4. Candy Cane\n \nFor those of you looking for a creative boost without jarring cerebral activity, Christmas has come early. Candy Cane is the indica you want, offering sweet mango and citrus flavors alongside uplifting euphoria that keeps the mind agile. This strain relaxes the body without robbing you of your faculties, so staying social and productive generally isn’t a problem.\n\n“The high is euphoric and uplifting. Makes me a little creative and energy high versus the couch effect.”\n\n“A great body high but keeps your mind racing. Overall a wonderful indica strain for sativa lovers!”\n5. Power Kush\n \nThey don’t call it Power Kush for nothin’. This strain does pack a euphoric punch, but there’s general consensus among Leafly reviewers that Power Kush won’t leave you glued to the couch. The cerebral effects aren’t as racy as your typical sativa; instead, they provide a calm mindset that allows you to stay focused and engaged, so long as you dose somewhat modestly.\n\n“I am relaxed but not couch-locked. I can still focus and task very well. This one will be an after-I-get-home-from-work strain…something to address the pain but not get me ready for bed yet.”\n\n“This is a great strain for depression. I should get couch lock but I don’t.”","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12001256/5-indica-cannabis-strains-for-sativa-fans.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/5-indica-cannabis-strains-for-sativa-fans"},{"id":"contentitems-3431","title":"New Strains Alert: White Lightning, Stardawg, Orange Skunk, and Candy Cane","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1395428400000)\/","text":"We added four new strains to the Leafly database this week, and they’ll be needing your evaluations!
