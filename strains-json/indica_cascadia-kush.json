            "text": "Over the 420 holiday weekend, DOPE Magazine celebrated their 4th annual DOPE Cup at 7-Point Studios in Seattle. The celebration was sponsored by Leafly and showcased some of the region\u2019s best cannabis flower, concentrates, edibles, topicals, glass artists, and accessories. Even a last-minute venue change couldn\u2019t stop the stream of cannabis lovers from overflowing the state fair-themed event that came complete with infused cotton candy, a mechanical joint to ride, magicians, performers, artists, and more. Honestly, the only thing missing was a medicated corn\u00a0dog to combat my munchies.\nAs expected, the dab bar was the hive that everyone was buzzing around, with a variety of solvent and solventless concentrates to sample from some of the best extract artists in the area. The highlight had to be local artist Scott Deppe\u2019s crystal skull piece that sat at the X-Tracted bar and captured every passer-by with its intricate design and whopping 6-figure price tag. Those who weren\u2019t concentrated around the dab rigs were busy sampling edibles, entering raffles, and relaxing with a massage at one the topical\u00a0company booths.\n\nA judge\u2019s pass to the event allowed visitors to join the action by sampling each of the strains entered into the People's\u00a0Choice category of the Cup. For $99, the judge\u2019s pass gave ticket-holders a half gram sample of all 10 anonymous strains and the opportunity to vote for their favorite. The mystery strains all had amazing flavors, ranging from sweet and tropical to earthy and piney, which made it all the more difficult to choose a favorite.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the DOPE Cup winners!\n\u00a0\nFlower Winners\n\n\u00a0\nPeople's Choice Flower\n\nWinner: CPC or Cotton Purple Chem\u00a0by\u00a0Hesperides Gardens (Strain #4)\n\u00a0\nJudges' Choice Flower\n\nWinner: The Sauce\u00a0by\u00a0ExoticGenetix (Strain #6)\n\u00a0\nBest Indica\n\nWinner: Cascadia Kush by Hesperides Gardens\nRunner Up: The White from Cannabis Club by Freak UV Nature\n\u00a0\nBest Sativa\n\nWinner: Matanuska Thunder Fuck by TJ's Gardens\nRunner Up: Head Cheese from Cali Connection\n\u00a0\nBest Hybrid\n\nWinner: Peppermint Cookies by GoldLeaf Gardens\nRunner Up: GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) by Rain City Cannabis & Top Shelf\n\u00a0\nHighest THC\n\nWinner: The White (29.9%) by Solstice\nRunner Up: DT-13 (28.7%) by Patient 99 Care\n\u00a0\nHighest CBD\n\nWinner: ACDC (18.05%) by Loaded Soda\nRunner Up: ACDC x Charlotte's Web (17.02%) by B-EZ and Fweedom\n\u00a0\nConcentrate Winners\n\n\u00a0\nBest BHO \u2013 THC\nWinner: Marmalade (94.36%) from Platinum Extracts\nRunner Up: Private Reserve OG (83.73%) from The Baker\u00e9\u00e9\n\u00a0\nBest BHO \u2013 CBD\n\nWinner: Sour Tsunami (83.7%) from Solstice by Refine\nRunner Up: Sour Tsunami (74.08%) by Stoney Extracts\n\u00a0\nBest CO2 \u2013 THC\nWinner: Mixed Berry (48.56%, 110 ppm) by Evergreen Extracts\nRunner Up: Death Star (69.09%, <10 ppm) by Happy Cats \u2013 CO2 Organics\n\u00a0\nBest CO2 \u2013 CBD\n\nWinner: ACDC x Remedy (78% CBD, <10 ppm) by Loaded Soda \u2013 CO2 Organics\nRunner Up: Evergreen Extracts (42.81% CBD, <10 ppm)\n\u00a0\nBest Non-Solvent \u2013 THC\n\nWinner: Kimbo Kush (84.37%, dry sift) Cuban Tech from Exotic Genetics\nRunner Up: Fire On the Mountain (82.68%) from\u00a0NW Alchemy featuring Head Hunter\n\u00a0\nBest Non-Solvent \u2013 CBD\n\nWinner: Remedy (52.5% CBD, 3390 ppm ethanol) by Hesperides Gardens\nRunner Up: ACDC (13.41% CBD bubble hash) Loaded Soda by CO2 Organics\n\u00a0\nEdible Winners\n\n\u00a0\nBest Edible \u2013 Savory\nWinner: Delux Nut Mix by Laurie and Marry Jane\nRunner Up: Capitol Hill Peanut Butter\n\u00a0\nBest Edible \u2013 Sweet\nWinner: Dark Chocolate Fudge by Mad Monster\nRunner Up: Almond Bites by Laurie and Marry Jane\n\u00a0\nBest Edible \u2013 Drink\nWinner: Loaded Soda Root Beer \u2013 104.85 mg THC\nRunner Up: Sensi Sweet Tropical Punch \u2013 58.68 mg THC\n\u00a0\nBest Edible \u2013 CBD\nWinner: Vanilla Truffles from The Bakeree\u00a0\u2013 Cookie Fam Genetics\nRunner Up: Slips by Oakor\n\u00a0\nBest Topical\nWinner: Kush Cream Cherry Bomb \u2013 2.01 mg THC\nRunner Up: Liberty Lotion High CBD \u2013 1.67 mg CBD",

This is definitely a good evening or rainy day strain. Did I mention the sweet aroma & flavor? Yeah it delivers there too. Smells like a solid dank Indica, with that great sweet/earthy smell. I'll be coming back for this one....",

This strain is shapeshifter, shifting with the users set and setting from session to session. I have experienced, from the same batch a range between feeling supremely relaxing and serene moments while doing yoga, to having the biggest panic attack of my life, during a time when my intuition was desperately trying to deliver me an urgent message about my personal safety that I was trying my hardest to tune out. Some might call this pot paranoia. But I've experienced cannabis enhanced paranoia and this was real, visceral fear, not my mind running away from me with anxiety.  It's possible this strain saved my life, that time.",
