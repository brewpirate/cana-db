With this, the high is very immediate and linear with no crazy peaks and dips. That makes it super easy to dose. Smoke a little, and you're calm/relaxed. Round 2 will have you feeling super euphoric and pain free. Round 3 will put you to bed. I love it. Did wonders for my anxiety, insomnia, back and ankle pain, and mood. ",
