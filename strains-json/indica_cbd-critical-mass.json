            "text": "This strain should be famous. I picked some up at Farma in Portland. If you like CBD you have to try this. It's hard to find CBD weed that leans Indica, which this one does. Extremely (seriously) well rounded full body high that makes me think there must be something very special going on with the cannabinoid and terpene profile in this particular strain. Every time I smoke it it's perfect. I'm very picky about strains because I have a super low tolerance and the differences between them really affect me. CBD Critical Mass makes me feel like I'm smoking weed that has a 100 percent guarantee of no thc induced anxiety. Frankly, it's brilliant stuff. Like I said, it should be famous. Unfortunately I live in LA and can't find it out here. I wish dispensaries would start carrying it, and growers out here would start growing it. It's Critical Mass so it should have a huge yield. Seems like it would be a grower's dream. No matter what level of weed smoker you are, you should try this. Especially if you love the magical 1:1 ratio of thc:cbd.\n\nYou know what it feels like? Feels like I imagined the weed that Gandalf is smoking in Lord of the Rings would feel.",
