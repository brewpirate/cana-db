I get several procedures to relax my muscles: biotic throughout my back to relax muscles, myobloc injected into my neck to relax my neck muscles, occipital nerve blocks injected into the back of my skull, along with steroid injections into my lower back for Lumbado. And ever since I have been consuming this medicine, I have lowered my pain medicine in half. I never smoked marijuana before and I am 28. I did this out of desperation and it had given me my life back. I strongly recommend this strain along with other high CBD strains.
