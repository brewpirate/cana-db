It\u0027s a seven day-long marathon where we gather around our televisions to gawk, mouth agape with terror, at the aquatic beasts staring back at use with their dead eyes and rows of razor-sharp teeth. To more adequately prepare you for a week-long bout with the only sea creature to ever kill Samuel L. Jackson, here are a few strains that will have you saying, “We need a bigger boat\" (or bowl).\n  Great White Shark\nThe Great White Shark is the mob boss of the deep blue sea. Having survived for millions of years on the flesh of others, this creature doesn’t only have a taste for blood, it lives for it. If you manage to get your hands on its ravenous strain counterpart, take note of its fruity odor and dense coating of crystals. Indulge in this strain\u0027s pleasant olfactory and visual stimuli, because it will likely be your last, right before Great White Shark takes a bite right out of your dome-piece.\n  Shark Shock\nWhen I think of Shock Shark, I think of some electrified abomination with gleaming bone saws for teeth and a devil-may-care attitude. This particular strain is more stunning than shocking, leaning toward full indica genetics that stink of skunks devoured by this carnivorous lightning rod floating just below the water’s placid surface.\n  OG Shark\nOG Shark makes more sense than people give it credit for. Ocean Grown Shark is the only kind of shark I’ve seen. So, knowing OG Shark began in Canada makes this cartilaginous predator slightly more polite, but it will still bite you right in the face. Canadian or not, this shark only knows mind-altering ferocity.\n  CBD Shark\nCBD Shark, the only CBD strain to make the shark list, is like the squeaky rubber shark toy you might play with in the bath, except it weights two thousand pounds. While it may be less intimidating by way of its supplementary anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety effects, this 80/20 indica will straight bite your legs off, making leaving the couch or bed or floor slightly more difficult. But don’t even sweat it — you\u0027ll be so lit on CBD Shark you’ll barely notice your missed appendages.\n  Shark Bite\nShark Bite is one of Leafly’s more literal shark strains. This strain is a cross of Great White Shark and Face Off OG, which is a suitable combination for this week-long television holiday dedicated to ocean predators that have the ability to remove body parts from unsuspecting victims.\n  Shark Attack\nShark Attack is a beautiful indica-dominant cross with rather conventional genetics. Crossing Super Skunk and White Widow, one hit of this strain will have you hearing John William’s Jaws score. Every dark corridor or unlit room become a vast, inky ocean full of razor-sharp teeth. This munchie-inducing strain will have you thanking your fridge manufacturer for the tiny interior light. (Just kidding, your fridge is full of sharks, too.)\nShark Week may only happen one week a year, but you can find potent strains that will take a bite out of your anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and laziness any time at Leafly — just check our Strain Explorer for options, or take a peek at some of our recommendations for strong cannabis strains.\n.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12001315/6-shark-themed-cannabis-strains-that-pack-a-powerful-bite.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/6-shark-themed-cannabis-strains-that-pack-a-powerful-bite"},{"id":"contentitems-3607","title":"Which Cannabis Strains Are High in CBD?","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1438790400000)\/","text":"CBD cannabis strains are hitting the market so fast, it’s impossible to keep track of them all. The list below will familiarize you with the most common CBD varieties, but keep in mind that your dispensary probably stocks many others. If these popular strains aren’t in stock or you’d like to try something new, ask your budtender to point out other standout CBD strains and products.\nWhat is CBD, you might ask? CBD stands for cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating cannabis constituent with a variety of studied benefits such as:\n\nPain relief\nAnti-inflammatory\nAnti-epileptic\nAnti-anxiety\n\n\nA strain can be high in THC, CBD, or a combination of the two. Both compounds have unique medicinal properties, some of which are amplified when both compounds are present (e.g. pain management). High-CBD or mixed strains tend to be the best choices for consumers prone to anxiety. But ultimately, you’ll be the one to decide which strain works best for you.\nNote that these strains tend to express consistent THC:CBD profiles, but you may encounter variations (e.g. ACDC may be found with little to no THC, or exhibit a balanced THC:CBD ratio). Always check each product’s tested cannabinoid profile to be certain of its THC and CBD levels.\nTo see if one of the below CBD strains is available nearby, click the strain tile and scroll down to its Finder map.\nCommon High-CBD/Low-THC Strains\nPopular Uses: Epilepsy, severe anxiety, inflammation, fatigue\n\nCommon Mixed THC/CBD Strains\nPopular Uses: Pain, mild anxiety, insomnia, inflammation\n\nYou can search Leafly’s strain database for more CBD strains, or contact your local dispensary to explore more options near you.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14155434/which-cannabis-strains-high-in-CBD.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/what-cannabis-strains-are-high-in-cbd"}],"reviewCount":80,"flavors":[{"name":"Lemon","score":22.5},{"name":"Skunk","score":20.986842105263158},{"name":"Berry","score":20.657894736842106},{"name":"Flowery","score":20.328947368421051},{"name":"Earthy","score":10.460526315789473}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":98.48684210526315},{"name":"Happy","score":81.90789473684211},{"name":"Hungry","score":45.460526315789473},{"name":"Sleepy","score":37.763157894736842},{"name":"Tingly","score":33.618421052631582}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":93.55263157894737},{"name":"Inflammation","score":80.263157894736835},{"name":"Stress","score":70.39473684210526},{"name":"Depression","score":59.60526315789474},{"name":"Headaches","score":48.289473684210527}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":51.381578947368425},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":23.815789473684209},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":21.973684210526315},{"name":"PTSD","score":12.631578947368421},{"name":"Migraines","score":10.131578947368421}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":49.14473684210526},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":35.460526315789473},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.8289473684210527},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.8289473684210527},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.6578947368421052}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cbd-shark_100x100_3ec1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/670836/b/cbd-shark__primary_92dd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cbd-shark_100x100_c9b9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/585460/b/cbd-shark__primary_b35c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cbd-shark_100x100_07b4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/585867/b/cbd-shark__primary_56d7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cbd-shark_100x100_4cf6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/583761/b/cbd-shark__primary_b48e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cbd-shark_100x100_94fe.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494769/b/cbd-shark__primary_1576.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/cbd-shark_100x100_ba2d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494703/b/cbd-shark__primary_699c.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":11,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Las Vegas, NV","Bellingham, WA","Montréal, QC","Nanaimo, BC","Vancouver, BC","Barrie, ON","Brampton, ON","Calgary, AB","Chandler, AZ"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/cbd-shark","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.5125/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Shark Shock","subtitle":null,"slug":"shark-shock","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/shark-shock","symbol":"Srk","applink":"leafly://strain/shark-shock"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":56,"outdoorFinish":"October","height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
