            "text": "I would give it 6 stars if I could! One of my absolute favorite strains. Very functional for an indica. The high is very happy and uplifted. For me, it makes my anxiety and depression fade away and replaces it with optimism and puts a smile on my face. Also, slightly energizing-makes me want to do fun stuff with friends. Yet there's still a deep relaxation you feel throughout your body as well. And with a delicious sweet and musky cherry flavor and lots of little orange hairs.",

            "text": "This was a really rough strain to vape and while it did have me buzzing, the euphoric feeling left pretty quickly. \nI picked this strain up when it was $25 an eighth and accidentally bought two of them on back to back visits to the dispensary and so it was a long time to finish it all as I didn't look forward to vaping the flower when it was in my rotation. \nCherries Jubilee isn't a very strong strain and what little high I did get off of it didn't last long maybe 90 minutes at best. It does do a decent job of putting you in the mood to sleep so I wouldn't want to smoke this and then go out and party but if you are looking for a mellow high, this might hit the spot.",
