This strain emits a unique bouquet of pine, citrus, chocolate, and hashy spice while showing richer herbal notes on the exhale. It hits with a rush to the head, but like many OGs, its settles back down into the limbs as midweight sedation. Chocolate Glue&rsquo;s mind-numbing buzz and pleasant physical effects make it a perfect option for unwinding after work. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
