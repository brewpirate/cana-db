This strains\u0027 fluffy dank buds smell of the best kind of oranges. Like it\u0027s intoxicating to smell it. There is a Utopia, and it\u0027s in this tasty bud. Its some of the dopest dope I ever smoked. Tastes like biting into a nice loud orangey citrus. Much love Colorado.\n","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":12,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":139.58333333333334},{"name":"Orange","score":68.75},{"name":"Lemon","score":68.75},{"name":"Flowery","score":50},{"name":"Skunk","score":12.5}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":160.41666666666666},{"name":"Happy","score":141.66666666666666},{"name":"Hungry","score":129.16666666666666},{"name":"Euphoric","score":97.916666666666657},{"name":"Sleepy","score":91.666666666666657}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":77.083333333333329},{"name":"Fatigue","score":62.5},{"name":"Inflammation","score":50},{"name":"Stress","score":39.583333333333329},{"name":"Depression","score":35.416666666666664}],"conditions":[{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":50},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":50},{"name":"Anxiety","score":31.25},{"name":"Migraines","score":12.5},{"name":"PTSD","score":12.5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":56.25}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/colorado-clementines_100x100_3d19.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/545099/b/colorado-clementines__primary_f7f7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/colorado-clementines_100x100_4d84.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/541588/b/colorado-clementines__primary_6e34.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/colorado-clementines_100x100_57b0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/503091/b/colorado-clementines__primary_30ee.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/colorado-clementines_100x100_d463.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/503090/b/colorado-clementines__primary_b193.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":4,"popularCities":["Spokane, WA","Otis Orchards-East Farms, WA","Peshastin, WA","Phoenix, AZ","Queen Creek, AZ"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/colorado-clementines","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Big White","subtitle":null,"slug":"big-white","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/big-white","symbol":"Bwh","applink":"leafly://strain/big-white"},{"name":"Agent Orange","subtitle":null,"slug":"agent-orange","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/agent-orange","symbol":"Ago","applink":"leafly://strain/agent-orange"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
