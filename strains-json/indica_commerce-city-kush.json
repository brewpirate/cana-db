Solid dense buds, deep green, dark orange, some nice crystals, great kush structure, earthy dank diesel nose and taste, gummy kief throwing goodness.  Ass kicking.  Not a work strain, not a party strain.  A great deep stoned high, outstanding pain relief, great for sleep and can definitely sit you down for a while.",

            "text": "I still consider myself new to medicinal marijuana though I was prescribed it last October 17. I've been trying so many different strains (never even knew there were different strains!) for the various health issues, from head to toe.  To me, my worst issue is depression, but my spouse thinks it is my fatigue & weakness, since I'm not as productive since becoming sick.  Either way, Commerce City has hands down won my heart because of its effect on my mood.  Nothing has made me more giggly, less anxious or less depressed, & helped me care, for the while, a little less about being putdown so much.  I actually wouldn't have tried it if it wasn't for his nagging me to try one that was an Indica, to help my insomnia, so that I could sleep, & be more productive.  I had been trying only to go for things that other people talked about using for their lethargy/fatigue, & I figured would help with the depression, as a stimulant maybe.  But I did as told (I'm out of it now, maybe that's why I sound a bit down), & I guess I could thank him for that at least!  I realize strains have, as any medicine seems to, different effects for different chemistry make ups in our bodies, so this review may not mean it will help you, but I hope it does,  More giggly people in the world?  I can think of worse things for all of us!!!  :)\nBut, I do need to be on the constant lookout for something that I can use, still be productive, or meaning, not so obviously giggly at a PTA meeting! (If I ever do actually go to one, that is! Though, if the whole PTA meeting was utilizing Commerce City, theeeennnnnn, yes, I think I would want to go to that meeting!)    Until then, this is the absolute best for your mood when you don't have to go anywhere or act \"sober,\" & as Leafly aptly put it, early evening, when you don't need to be productive.  I could be extremely productive in trying to find a pen, to try, really hard, to remember to write down either the extremely funny, or incredibly genius idea I had, & reread it later (if I was actually successful in getting to writing!!!) & say, \"Wha?  Is that a word?\"  All the while remembering feeling that blissful, & actually being happy enough to think things were hysterical or brilliant.  I like living like that.  I can say nothing bad about commerce city, & I think it could be a lifesaver for depression, truly, which is vital.  Dearly disappointed that I am out of it, & so low.  But I do need to find another one that will work for anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue during the day strain - on the look out, so that my days will hopefully be less panic stricken, & less bleak soon.  I am grateful to have found Commerce City, & am going to try to find a way to buy as much as legally possible for fear of them running out, as one reviewer already stated happens.  Anxiety stricken now!  Off to garden remedies soon!  I hope this review helps someone as greatly as Commerce city helps me.  I need to find the forums, to ask some people out there for recommendations for daytime!   Good luck to all of you in your searches too!  xLOVEx",
