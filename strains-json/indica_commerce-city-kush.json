I\u0027ve been trying so many different strains (never even knew there were different strains!) for the various health issues, from head to toe.  To me, my worst issue is depression, but my spouse thinks it is my fatigue \u0026 weakness, since I\u0027m not as productive since becoming sick.  Either way, Commerce City has hands down won my heart because of its effect on my mood.  Nothing has made me more giggly, less anxious or less depressed, \u0026 helped me care, for the while, a little less about being putdown so much.  I actually wouldn\u0027t have tried it if it wasn\u0027t for his nagging me to try one that was an Indica, to help my insomnia, so that I could sleep, \u0026 be more productive.  I had been trying only to go for things that other people talked about using for their lethargy/fatigue, \u0026 I figured would help with the depression, as a stimulant maybe.  But I did as told (I\u0027m out of it now, maybe that\u0027s why I sound a bit down), \u0026 I guess I could thank him for that at least!  I realize strains have, as any medicine seems to, different effects for different chemistry make ups in our bodies, so this review may not mean it will help you, but I hope it does,  More giggly people in the world?  I can think of worse things for all of us!!!  :)\nBut, I do need to be on the constant lookout for something that I can use, still be productive, or meaning, not so obviously giggly at a PTA meeting! (If I ever do actually go to one, that is! Though, if the whole PTA meeting was utilizing Commerce City, theeeennnnnn, yes, I think I would want to go to that meeting!)    Until then, this is the absolute best for your mood when you don\u0027t have to go anywhere or act \"sober,\" \u0026 as Leafly aptly put it, early evening, when you don\u0027t need to be productive.  I could be extremely productive in trying to find a pen, to try, really hard, to remember to write down either the extremely funny, or incredibly genius idea I had, \u0026 reread it later (if I was actually successful in getting to writing!!!) \u0026 say, \"Wha?  Is that a word?\"  All the while remembering feeling that blissful, \u0026 actually being happy enough to think things were hysterical or brilliant.  I like living like that.  I can say nothing bad about commerce city, \u0026 I think it could be a lifesaver for depression, truly, which is vital.  Dearly disappointed that I am out of it, \u0026 so low.  But I do need to find another one that will work for anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue during the day strain - on the look out, so that my days will hopefully be less panic stricken, \u0026 less bleak soon.  I am grateful to have found Commerce City, \u0026 am going to try to find a way to buy as much as legally possible for fear of them running out, as one reviewer already stated happens.  Anxiety stricken now!  Off to garden remedies soon!  I hope this review helps someone as greatly as Commerce city helps me.

Nothing has made me more giggly, less anxious or less depressed, \u0026 helped me care, for the while, a little less about being putdown so much.  I actually wouldn\u0027t have tried it if it wasn\u0027t for his nagging me to try one that was an Indica, to help my insomnia, so that I could sleep, \u0026 be more productive.  I had been trying only to go for things that other people talked about using for their lethargy/fatigue, \u0026 I figured would help with the depression, as a stimulant maybe.  But I did as told (I\u0027m out of it now, maybe that\u0027s why I sound a bit down), \u0026 I guess I could thank him for that at least!  I realize strains have, as any medicine seems to, different effects for different chemistry make ups in our bodies, so this review may not mean it will help you, but I hope it does,  More giggly people in the world?  I can think of worse things for all of us!!!  :)\nBut, I do need to be on the constant lookout for something that I can use, still be productive, or meaning, not so obviously giggly at a PTA meeting! (If I ever do actually go to one, that is! Though, if the whole PTA meeting was utilizing Commerce City, theeeennnnnn, yes, I think I would want to go to that meeting!)    Until then, this is the absolute best for your mood when you don\u0027t have to go anywhere or act \"sober,\" \u0026 as Leafly aptly put it, early evening, when you don\u0027t need to be productive.  I could be extremely productive in trying to find a pen, to try, really hard, to remember to write down either the extremely funny, or incredibly genius idea I had, \u0026 reread it later (if I was actually successful in getting to writing!!!) \u0026 say, \"Wha?  Is that a word?\"  All the while remembering feeling that blissful, \u0026 actually being happy enough to think things were hysterical or brilliant.  I like living like that.  I can say nothing bad about commerce city, \u0026 I think it could be a lifesaver for depression, truly, which is vital.  Dearly disappointed that I am out of it, \u0026 so low.  But I do need to find another one that will work for anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue during the day strain - on the look out, so that my days will hopefully be less panic stricken, \u0026 less bleak soon.  I am grateful to have found Commerce City, \u0026 am going to try to find a way to buy as much as legally possible for fear of them running out, as one reviewer already stated happens.  Anxiety stricken now!  Off to garden remedies soon!  I hope this review helps someone as greatly as Commerce city helps me.  I need to find the forums, to ask some people out there for recommendations for daytime!   Good luck to all of you in your searches too!  xLOVEx","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":12,"flavors":[{"name":"Pungent","score":15},{"name":"Diesel","score":10},{"name":"Earthy","score":10},{"name":"Chemical","score":10},{"name":"Sweet","score":5}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":105},{"name":"Euphoric","score":75},{"name":"Happy","score":65},{"name":"Uplifted","score":60},{"name":"Talkative","score":55}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":70},{"name":"Depression","score":65},{"name":"Headaches","score":65},{"name":"Pain","score":65},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":50}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":10},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":10},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":10},{"name":"Arthritis","score":5},{"name":"Epilepsy","score":5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":5}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/commerce-city-kush_100x100_4977.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001479/b/commerce-city-kush__primary_e413.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Detroit, MI","Ann Arbor, MI","Denver, CO","Great Barrington, MA","Linwood, MI","Moses Lake, WA","Newton, MA","Otis Orchards-East Farms, WA","Spokane Valley, WA","Spokane, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/commerce-city-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.41666666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Chemdawg 4","subtitle":null,"slug":"chemdawg-4","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/chemdawg-4","symbol":"Cd4","applink":"leafly://strain/chemdawg-4"},{"name":"Rare Dankness #1","subtitle":null,"slug":"rare-dankness-1","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/rare-dankness-1","symbol":"Rd1","applink":"leafly://strain/rare-dankness-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
