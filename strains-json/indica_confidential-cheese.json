I felt happy and relaxed but not so much that I was too couch locked. This made me super MUNCHY. So if you need an appetite stimulant this would be perfect. Had heightened arousal, not as much as some strains, but definitely notable. Went to bed easily and didn\u0027t wake up once during the night. Overall nice strain.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"},{"id":1630632,"username":"MyJokerHandStayLIT","text":"WOow.

Jean Guy\nA fan favorite from our neighbors to the North (Canada, eh?), Jean Guy (pronounced “Jawn Gee”) is a sativa-dominant strain known for its high THC content and energizing effects. A great one to start your day cramp-free.\n 2. Hog\u0027s Breath\nHog’s Breath is a well-known indica with roots in the Kush landrace and is known for its potency against heavy pain and anxiety – a good strain to relax after a long work day.\n 3. Medicine Man\nMedicine Man lives up to its name by delivering potent pain relief with high levels of both THC and CBD. This medicinal strain is closely related to the master of the indica jungle – White Rhino.\n 4. Hash Plant\nHash Plant is known for an abundance of trichomes and a heavy body stone. This indica has a reputation for blissful euphoria, as well as easing pain and inflammation associated with Crohn’s and Colitis.\n 5. Willie Nelson\nWillie Nelson is named for the Red-Headed Stranger himself. This sativa offers a clear-headed, energetic high known to incite creativity, as well as a decent case of the munchies. \n 6. Chemo\nChemo is just as sedative as you might imagine – a heavy body high that’s perfect for chronic pain. Take note: the munchies are strong with this one. If you have stomach cramps or trouble eating, this strain will inspire your appetite.\n 7. Lemon Jack\nLemon Jack is born of the famed Jack Herer and Lemon Kush and offers strong psychoactive effects. Lemon Jack is a daytime strain as strong as a cup of coffee, but without the harsh stomach irritation. Recommended for users who suffer from fatigue.\n 8. Golden Pineapple\nGolden Pineapple is as delightful as it sounds. A hybrid cross that delivers uplifting, creative effects with a delicious fruity taste, it offers relief from stress and anxiety without causing fatigue.\n 9. Confidential Cheese\nConfidential Cheese is born of the legendary LA Confidential and Exodus Cheese. It offers powerful pain relief, as well as relief from insomnia. Great for winding down before bedtime, Confidential Cheese also subdues painful muscle spasms and cramps.\n 10. K2\nK2 is named for the world’s second highest mountain peak, which makes sense, as it comes from two of the greats – White Widow and Hindu Kush. K2 is known to increase appetite and calm nausea without any sedative sleepy effects, making it a great strain for both daytime and evening use.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002927/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis"}],"reviewCount":121,"flavors":[{"name":"Cheese","score":49.679487179487182},{"name":"Pine","score":28.717948717948715},{"name":"Pungent","score":28.012820512820511},{"name":"Earthy","score":24.03846153846154},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":20.76923076923077}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":118.78205128205128},{"name":"Tingly","score":98.397435897435884},{"name":"Happy","score":90.256410256410263},{"name":"Hungry","score":77.115384615384613},{"name":"Sleepy","score":68.84615384615384}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":44.1025641025641},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":40.96153846153846},{"name":"Depression","score":30.641025641025639},{"name":"Pain","score":23.910256410256412},{"name":"Insomnia","score":14.423076923076923}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":38.205128205128204},{"name":"PTSD","score":33.269230769230766},{"name":"PMS","score":28.525641025641026},{"name":"Asthma","score":24.551282051282048},{"name":"Cancer","score":24.551282051282048}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":50.833333333333329},{"name":"Paranoid","score":24.551282051282048},{"name":"Anxious","score":21.153846153846153},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":13.461538461538462},{"name":"Dizzy","score":8.5256410256410238}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/confidential-cheese_100x100_dbab.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000032/b/confidential-cheese__primary_27b3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/confidential-cheese_100x100_cec9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/620172/b/confidential-cheese__primary_c05f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/confidential-cheese_100x100_6df0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/604299/b/confidential-cheese__primary_9cc0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/confidential-cheese_100x100_4ba0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/542705/b/confidential-cheese__primary_f7a5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/confidential-cheese_100x100_f76c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/495853/b/confidential-cheese__primary_c114.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/confidential-cheese_100x100_cbdb.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/464359/b/confidential-cheese__primary_f72c.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":19,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Seattle, WA","Spokane, WA","Bellingham, WA","Everett, WA","Montréal, QC","Renton, WA","Vancouver, BC","Auburn, WA","Barrie, ON"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/confidential-cheese","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.51239669421488/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"LA Confidential","subtitle":null,"slug":"la-confidential","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/la-confidential","symbol":"La","applink":"leafly://strain/la-confidential"},{"name":"Cheese","subtitle":null,"slug":"cheese","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese","symbol":"Che","applink":"leafly://strain/cheese"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
