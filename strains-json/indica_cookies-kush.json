After about two hours, it completely knocked me out and I woke up as the movie I had just started was ending. For as strong as the high was, it didn't mess with my brain too much and I was mostly just relaxed as I tried to watch movies with my wife.\n\nThere are two reasons that I don't give this a fully five stars. First, I don't like being glued to the couch quite like that and second, it gave me a terrible dry mouth. I normally handle dry mouth like a champ, but this was downright extreme.",
