A few puffs from my vaporizer and I was glued to the couch, virtually unable to budge for hours. After about two hours, it completely knocked me out and I woke up as the movie I had just started was ending. For as strong as the high was, it didn\u0027t mess with my brain too much and I was mostly just relaxed as I tried to watch movies with my wife.\n\nThere are two reasons that I don\u0027t give this a fully five stars. First, I don\u0027t like being glued to the couch quite like that and second, it gave me a terrible dry mouth. I normally handle dry mouth like a champ, but this was downright extreme.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1639004,"username":"WeedJesuss","text":"As a sativa lover I have to say this strain has been my best experience ever.
