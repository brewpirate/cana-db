I am not a huge pure indica person, but I needed it for pain, nausea, and relaxation. It worked great on all three levels without leaving me totally sleepy like most pure indicas... this to me was an excellent thing. I am somebody with a lot of stuff to accomplish throughout the day. In addition, I found it way less harsh than many strains I've smoked lately. I needed to add no ice in my bong, for once! A lovely taste and smell make Critical Hog the bomb overall. This particular batch came from Shambhala MCC and I highly recommend.",

Smoking right along and next thing you know a  hit of euphoria and relaxation start to mingle in.  Got mine as a 3.5g pre-roll pack from SWC and dig the bang for the buck of getting 2 sessions per. Will be keeping my eyes peeled for this strain in the future!",
