I am not a huge pure indica person, but I needed it for pain, nausea, and relaxation. It worked great on all three levels without leaving me totally sleepy like most pure indicas... this to me was an excellent thing. I am somebody with a lot of stuff to accomplish throughout the day. In addition, I found it way less harsh than many strains I\u0027ve smoked lately. I needed to add no ice in my bong, for once! A lovely taste and smell make Critical Hog the bomb overall. This particular batch came from Shambhala MCC and I highly recommend.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1625200,"username":"Murrmann","text":"Not very often do I find myself not finishing a .7g doobie but that\u0027s what happened with Critical Hog!
