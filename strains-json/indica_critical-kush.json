Genetics, nutrients, grow mediums, climate, and many other factors are responsible for determining the yield of your garden. The first of those factors, the plant’s genetics, dictate which attributes the plant is capable of expressing, while environmental factors are what help coax them out in the growing process.\nBelow are five strains with genetics that predispose them to heavy yields. Consider sowing these strains if you’re looking to achieve a bigger harvest this year.\n\nWhite Widow\nWhite Widow is a famous Amsterdam hybrid that was created by crossing landrace strains from Southern India and Brazil. Now famous worldwide, White Widow is known for its impressive resin production and powerful euphoria. Consumers may celebrate its effects, but growers celebrate White Widow’s large yields.\nThere’s a reason why this award-winning hybrid remains popular since its birth in the 90s. Not only is this strain a heavy yielder, White Widow is resilient toward mold and pests, and flowering wraps up in just eight to nine weeks. White Widow fares best in indoor gardens, so find some seeds and watch this plant take off.\n\nCheese Quake\nCheese Quake combines the power of a quality strain with high yields. Created by TGA Subcool Seeds, this indica-dominant hybrid combines genetics from Cheese and Querkle. Its effects strike a balance between cerebral and physical, elevating the mind while saddling the body with relief. The aroma is sour and funky like cheese, with sweet fruity undertones.\nGenerally grown indoors, Cheese Quake will grow fast and big. Top this plant early on in vegetation to help it grow into a bushy shape. Low stress training (LST) and pruning will help keep this plant headed towards an epic yield of quality buds.\n\nPurple Trainwreck\nAnother outdoor California classic, Purple Trainwreck is famous for its high yields and ease of growing. This strain was created by the Humboldt Seed Organization by crossing the longtime favorite Trainwreck with Mendocino Purps. The resulting hybrid holds onto both Trainwreck’s wonderful aroma and effects and Mendo Purp’s weight and resilience. Purple Trainwreck offers a euphoric and uplifting high, making it a perfect strain for entry-level consumers looking for a mellow experience.\nThis strain will thrive either indoors or outdoors, with a favorable flowering time of just eight weeks. For this reason, Purple Trainwreck is a hit for light-deprivation greenhouses or growers looking to harvest early in the fall.\n\nCritical Kush\nCritical Kush was created by breeding two legendary strains, Critical Mass and OG Kush. Its parent strain Critical Mass is known for its sweet citrus flavor while OG Kush brings to the table earthy flavors and potency. With their forces combined, Critical Kush inherits potency, flavor, and heavy yields.\nAny moisture influx will cause Critical Kush’s buds to mold from the inside out, which is why this strain needs to be grown in a space where humidity can be precisely regulated. For this reason, growing indoors or in a greenhouse is recommended. Heavy feeding is necessary to ensure the buds grow dense, healthy, and heavy.\n\nBlue Dream\nBlue Dream is regarded as the most popular strain in the United States. This hybrid is heavy-yielding, mildew-resistant, flavorful, easy to find, and calming in effects. Due to its overwhelming presence and pacifying, mellow euphoria, Blue Dream is popular among novice consumers. However, many connoisseurs and heavy consumers have moved past the Blue Dream hype.\nHaving been bred for outdoor farming in California, Blue Dream reaches its full potential under the sun. It responds well to a Mediterranean climate and takes off vertically. Blue Dream grows lanky and tall, but produces dense buds which help to make its yields exceptional.\n\nThe quality of Blue Dream varies widely depending on how it was grown, hence why so many connoisseurs steer toward other genetics. As a popular high-yielding strain, many cultivators grow Blue Dream as a cash crop without putting enough attention towards the quality of the product. Try finding a quality Blue Dream and see if this changes your opinion.\nWhile this is a short list of popular, high-yielding strains, there are so many others out there begging to be discovered, grown, and celebrated. As farming tactics and technology improve, yields will continue to increase. But don’t forget that behind any high-yielding crop is a capable farmer who pays attention to his or her plant’s needs.\nWhich heavy yielders would you add to this list? Drop a comment below for other curious growers.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24151752/high-yield-cannabis-strains.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/high-yielding-marijuana-strains"},{"id":"contentitems-39987","title":"Tips for Growing Critical Kush Cannabis","author":"Leafly Staff","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1504137898000)\/","text":"Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and General Hydroponics are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Produced by Barney’s Farm, Critical Kush was bred by crossing Critical Mass with OG Kush. Known for its spicy, earthy flavor and overwhelming yield, this strain remains popular among growers and consumers alike.\nGrow Techniques: Provide plenty of space for these plants when you grow them. Prune aggressively and trellis the branches so that the buds have room to fill in. Maintain low humidity while flowering and keep airflow up to prevent bud rot. Grow either hydroponically or in soil and keep the buds out of the rain if growing outside. Critical Kush is a great option for growing in greenhouses if you’re looking for a large harvest.\nFlowering Time: 8 weeks \nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Prefers a temperate to hot climate between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Suitable for either indoor or outdoor gardens. Works well in greenhouses where humidity can be managed effectively.\nFeeding: Feed heavily while flowering to keep the buds swelling. If using liquid nutrients, also top dress the soil to allow the plants to take in a diversity of flowering nutrients at their desired rate.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/30165948/critical-kush-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-critical-kush-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":567,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":44.362341932980868},{"name":"Woody","score":25.901302330508777},{"name":"Pungent","score":24.929421903833404},{"name":"Sweet","score":21.182949019136256},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":18.189249510033395}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":84.15009942492452},{"name":"Happy","score":67.844447593974081},{"name":"Euphoric","score":66.859503777288168},{"name":"Sleepy","score":62.847539859445078},{"name":"Uplifted","score":40.848039489375346}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":64.213684133671762},{"name":"Depression","score":56.034892493668728},{"name":"Insomnia","score":41.52712102926629},{"name":"Pain","score":41.387253280879349},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":38.6986644562695}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":44.155546679608371},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":22.621568265339281},{"name":"PTSD","score":21.927025398093388},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":21.000312089755866},{"name":"Migraines","score":12.76958900069719}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":40.420920321194757},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":27.215515155679821},{"name":"Dizzy","score":10.781842102625992},{"name":"Paranoid","score":4.8681349201236328},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.011905222063314}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/critical-kush_100x100_a13d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002932/b/critical-kush__primary_455c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/critical-kush_100x100_04ab.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/708781/b/critical-kush__primary_4976.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/critical-kush_100x100_f533.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/673422/b/critical-kush__primary_8870.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/critical-kush_100x100_a780.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/671568/b/critical-kush__primary_ddcd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/critical-kush_100x100_9e59.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/671439/b/critical-kush__primary_2ef9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/critical-kush_100x100_32e6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/664716/b/critical-kush__primary_787c.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":168,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Phoenix, AZ","Seattle, WA","Spokane, WA","Eugene, OR","Las Vegas, NV","Los Angeles, CA","Shoreline, WA","Everett, WA","Lynnwood, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/critical-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.47266313932981/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Critical Mass","subtitle":null,"slug":"critical-mass","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/critical-mass","symbol":"Cm","applink":"leafly://strain/critical-mass"},{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":55,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Genetics, nutrients, grow mediums, climate, and many other factors are responsible for determining the yield of your garden. The first of those factors, the plant’s genetics, dictate which attributes the plant is capable of expressing, while environmental factors are what help coax them out in the growing process.\nBelow are five strains with genetics that predispose them to heavy yields. Consider sowing these strains if you’re looking to achieve a bigger harvest this year.\n\nWhite Widow\nWhite Widow is a famous Amsterdam hybrid that was created by crossing landrace strains from Southern India and Brazil. Now famous worldwide, White Widow is known for its impressive resin production and powerful euphoria. Consumers may celebrate its effects, but growers celebrate White Widow’s large yields.\nThere’s a reason why this award-winning hybrid remains popular since its birth in the 90s. Not only is this strain a heavy yielder, White Widow is resilient toward mold and pests, and flowering wraps up in just eight to nine weeks. White Widow fares best in indoor gardens, so find some seeds and watch this plant take off.\n\nCheese Quake\nCheese Quake combines the power of a quality strain with high yields. Created by TGA Subcool Seeds, this indica-dominant hybrid combines genetics from Cheese and Querkle. Its effects strike a balance between cerebral and physical, elevating the mind while saddling the body with relief. The aroma is sour and funky like cheese, with sweet fruity undertones.\nGenerally grown indoors, Cheese Quake will grow fast and big. Top this plant early on in vegetation to help it grow into a bushy shape. Low stress training (LST) and pruning will help keep this plant headed towards an epic yield of quality buds.\n\nPurple Trainwreck\nAnother outdoor California classic, Purple Trainwreck is famous for its high yields and ease of growing. This strain was created by the Humboldt Seed Organization by crossing the longtime favorite Trainwreck with Mendocino Purps. The resulting hybrid holds onto both Trainwreck’s wonderful aroma and effects and Mendo Purp’s weight and resilience. Purple Trainwreck offers a euphoric and uplifting high, making it a perfect strain for entry-level consumers looking for a mellow experience.\nThis strain will thrive either indoors or outdoors, with a favorable flowering time of just eight weeks. For this reason, Purple Trainwreck is a hit for light-deprivation greenhouses or growers looking to harvest early in the fall.\n\nCritical Kush\nCritical Kush was created by breeding two legendary strains, Critical Mass and OG Kush. Its parent strain Critical Mass is known for its sweet citrus flavor while OG Kush brings to the table earthy flavors and potency. With their forces combined, Critical Kush inherits potency, flavor, and heavy yields.\nAny moisture influx will cause Critical Kush’s buds to mold from the inside out, which is why this strain needs to be grown in a space where humidity can be precisely regulated. For this reason, growing indoors or in a greenhouse is recommended. Heavy feeding is necessary to ensure the buds grow dense, healthy, and heavy.\n\nBlue Dream\nBlue Dream is regarded as the most popular strain in the United States. This hybrid is heavy-yielding, mildew-resistant, flavorful, easy to find, and calming in effects. Due to its overwhelming presence and pacifying, mellow euphoria, Blue Dream is popular among novice consumers. However, many connoisseurs and heavy consumers have moved past the Blue Dream hype.\nHaving been bred for outdoor farming in California, Blue Dream reaches its full potential under the sun. It responds well to a Mediterranean climate and takes off vertically. Blue Dream grows lanky and tall, but produces dense buds which help to make its yields exceptional.\n\nThe quality of Blue Dream varies widely depending on how it was grown, hence why so many connoisseurs steer toward other genetics. As a popular high-yielding strain, many cultivators grow Blue Dream as a cash crop without putting enough attention towards the quality of the product. Try finding a quality Blue Dream and see if this changes your opinion.\nWhile this is a short list of popular, high-yielding strains, there are so many others out there begging to be discovered, grown, and celebrated. As farming tactics and technology improve, yields will continue to increase. But don’t forget that behind any high-yielding crop is a capable farmer who pays attention to his or her plant’s needs.\nWhich heavy yielders would you add to this list?
