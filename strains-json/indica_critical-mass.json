            "text": "Back in February, Portugal. The Man (PTM) keyboardist Kyle O\u2019Quin made a sophisticated splash into the Oregon cannabis industry by combining classical piano with craft cannabis in a rare performance at the historical Harry McCormick House in Portland.\n\nPart of the Live at HiFi concert series that\u2019s hosted acts such as Stephen Malkmus of Pavement and China Forbes of Pink Martini, this particular evening was dubbed Higher Education. The purpose was to create an environment where, according to O\u2019Quin, \u201cArtists can share their love of their art, whether it be music or painting or writing, using our collective understanding of cannabis as the platform for a cross-disciplinary examination.\u201d\n\nThe world-class pianist, inspired by Leonard Bernstein\u2019s The Unanswered Question lecture series, impressed the intimate crowd with his command of the keys, knowledge of music history, and keen sense of humor while pounding out sweet melodies by Beethoven, Chopin, and Debussy, under the influence and alongside his adorable dog, Boo Boo. The evening was a precursor to the release of a custom pre-roll blend designed to pair with PTM\u2019s single \u201cFeel It Still\u201d off the new album Woodstock.\nEnamored of PTM\u2019s recent music and cannabis collaborations, Leafly spoke with Kyle O\u2019Quin about Woodstock and weed.\n\u00a0\n\nLeafly: While no one seems to know the origin of the name Portugal. The Man, I\u2019m told there\u2019s a chance cannabis had something to do with its creation. Is that true?\nKyle O\u2019Quin: I can most definitely assure you the band name wasn\u2019t a result of a smoke session. It was just an alter ego, honestly. It\u2019s always freeing as an artist to have an alter ego. We were never \u2026 just one person, but a band. So, a country is a group of people that have one voice in the world. That\u2019s the period. He\u2019s just a dude we made up. We wanted you to know that he is, in fact, the man.\nWhat\u2019s PTM\u2019s relationship with cannabis?\nOh, I\u2019d say our relationship is nothing short of healthy. No alternative facts here.\n\nDo you toke during jam sessions or before a performance?\nWe used to. Well, a few of us [did], especially me and our drummer Jason \u2026 John and Zach didn\u2019t smoke as much back then. This is actually the reason why we still don\u2019t smoke to this day before we play.\nA long time ago, I did what I do best, I got Jason nice and ripped before the show. During the breakdown in a song, he just forgot what song we were performing. It was dead silence. Maybe because I was stoned too, but it was so fucking quiet for what seemed like the longest five seconds ever. Jason looked over at Zach like:\n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the break.\u201d\n\u201cOoohhh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCount us back in, J.\u201d\n\u201cOK.\u201d\n[pause]\n\u201cWait, which song?\u201d\nAnd, this is my favorite part\u2014he clicks off one, two, three, four. Then, we all came back in playing. Jason just kept clicking on five, six, seven, eight. We laugh about it now, but I can trace our not smoking onstage to that night exactly.\nKyle O\u2019Quin performs during Higher Education at The Harry McCormick House in Portland. (Courtesy of Mirifoto)\nWhile cannabis can spur creativity, it\u2019s not always best for getting shit done.\nI think people have a common misconception about creativity and drug use when it comes to songwriting: Anyone who\u2019s really creative doesn\u2019t need drugs to be creative. But [cannabis] can be a great tool, as opposed to a crutch.\nIt gives me endurance sometimes, a few extra hours I didn\u2019t think I had in me at the end of the day. It helps you put on the blinders and focus in on something better while being able to zone other things out, which is fucking great if you\u2019re sitting in your room alone playing piano or mumbling a melody into a phone at 2 a.m. with an acoustic guitar.\n\n\nBut it\u2019s a different story when you\u2019re playing live. We do a lot of jamming and for that to work, we have to take the blinders off and be even more aware of what everyone else is doing. We all have to be in the same mindstate on stage. We like to set up as close as possible. We\u2019re kind of one unit working together, not a five-part machine. That\u2019s actually the best explanation I can give for the difference in our smoking habits on stage versus off stage.\nAre you a fan of eating your cannabis?\nI actually make pretty fucking good cookies, not gonna lie. I use off the shelf chocolate chip Ghirardelli brand cookies and people always say that the cookies are delicious, not just that they get you high, which is always a plus.\nNot sure if it\u2019s true, or a rumor I once heard, so maybe someone can back this up: Before I put my herb in the butter, I put it in a little foil envelope and cook it in the oven for about five minutes on 250 degrees. Just before it changes color or at the first sight of it, I pull it out.\n\nAh, yes, decarboxylation.\nI was told it\u2019s supposed to make them more potent by activating the cannabis. I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019ve been doing it for years and getting pretty high.\nEdibles are a toss-up for me. Now [with cannabis legal] they\u2019re better regulated than the good ol\u2019 fashioned homemade cookies. It used to always be, \u201cI can\u2019t feel it\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t fucking move.\u201d I never liked that inconsistency.\nWhat was it like to be in the studio with Mike D of Beastie Boys fame for the making of your album Woodstock?\nIt was such an eye-opening experience for us. We wouldn\u2019t be a band if wasn\u2019t for the Beastie Boys, so it\u2019s pretty personal because we grew up on that shit, literally. Getting insight into their creative process \u2026 it\u2019s just so spontaneous. Write about what\u2019s happening right now. What we did today! Drinking beers in the Pavilion\u2019s parking lot. Put it in the lyrics! We\u2019re like, \u201cWhat?!?\u201d\nAnd then, you realize that\u2019s totally what made them the Beastie Boys. It\u2019s this \u2018capture the moment\u2019 vibe that so prominent in hip hop and it\u2019s just not even there anymore when it comes to rock music. Mike really inspired us to make sure we made something reflective of everything we\u2019re all seeing around us every day, to always be willing to try something new, and to dive into the deep end when we do.\nCare to share another story involving cannabis or Mike D?\nThis producer John Goodmanson produced Iron Flag for Wu-Tang [and once told me], \u201cDo not smoke Wu-Tang\u2019s weed!\u201d Not sure if it was laced or what the deal was. Anyways, Mike said he learned that the hard way. I remember him saying he was at John Lennon and Yoko\u2019s apartment in New York where his famous white piano is located, and he got way too high, fell asleep on their couch, and woke up embarrassed. I don\u2019t remember if Wu-Tang was there and if it was their weed, but I\u2019d like to think it was.\nPTM and HiFi Farms at Serra in Portland with the \u201cFeel It Still\u201d pre-roll.\n\u201cFeel It Still\u201d is a super catchy tune. On 4/20, you announced a custom blended pre-roll designed to pair with that song. Tell us about it.\nHonestly, as a band, we\u2019ve never smoked more weed. Why the fuck not make your own blend? Both of the strains we used are hybrids, but honestly both lean toward the sativa side to me. \u201cFeel It Still\u201d is a summer song. The strain can\u2019t weigh you down like a heavy indica high. It\u2019s got to be a light, uplifting, fun, outdoor vibey, summer, fucking \u2018fun in the sun\u2019 weed. Not to mention the [nod to our album] in using Headband: For those who haven\u2019t smoked it, it kind of hits you right in the middle of the forehead and you can feel it a little by your temples. It feels like you\u2019re wearing a headband. There\u2019s not much closer of a reference we could make to Woodstock [cough] than Headband.\n\nIt was one of the coolest experiences watching you match classical musicians with different strains. Will you recount a few for our readers?\n\nThe concept was based off Leonard Bernstein\u2019s explanation of music through language in his lectures on The Unanswered Question where it seemed easier to talk about something complicated using something we all know about. He compared music to Chomsky\u2019s analysis of language and it sparked something, this idea of cross discipline.\nClassical music always seems stuffy, so I thought it would be fun to wear jeans and a t-shirt, smoke weed, cuss, and talk about classical music only in terms of cannabis. For example, Rachmaninoff Prelude Op. 3 No. 2 was paired with Critical Mass, which has a 1:1 ratio of THC to CBD. The way THC and CBD activate each other is reflective of the dynamics in the piece being either as loud as you can play or as soft as you can play. The louder or softer you play, the more the dynamics play off each other.\nSince [Critical Mass] is a 1:1 ratio, it\u2019s not as high in THC [as other strains], which is what I love about it. It\u2019s a very restrained high. When you hear recordings of Rachmaninoff play his own music, it\u2019s always more restrained than anyone else plays it. This restrained quality being at the heart of his music couldn\u2019t be more in common with the restrained high Critical Mass offers. [And] still, he is heavy as fuck and this [strain] is no doubt an indica.\nI recall some fun Beethoven comparisons, too\u2026\nI played Beethoven\u2019s Pathetique Sonata (1799), arguably the first romantic piece of music, and paired it with Blue Dream\u2014an award-winning hybrid to show how Beethoven was the ultimate hybrid composer. He blended the Classical era into the Romantic like a fucking badass.\nThe next concert will include a Beethoven cello and piano Sonata where the cello player will be \u201cplaying the indica strain\u201d because the cello is the same range as the voice and is very in touch with the body. I\u2019ll be \u201cplaying the sativa strain\u201d on the piano (the cerebral high tinkly shit) and together we\u2019ll be a hybrid, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera\u2026\n\nI know it\u2019s important for PTM to raise awareness for reasonable drug policy. Are you involved in any other initiatives to meet this goal?\nFirst, I smoke weed every single day. Then, there are other things: At that classical concert, we donated the money to a local organization called My Voice Music that helps younger kids write and record their own music as a way of dealing with mental issues \u2026 it\u2019s important to show that cannabis can help fund art programs for our communities and youth.\nWe addressed a bunch of social issues in our video for \u201cFeel It Still\u201d and part of the toolkit was a link to Drug Policy Alliance, a reputable organization fighting the War on Drugs. It\u2019s odd that there\u2019s an opiate epidemic that\u2019s killing insane amounts of people and yet, federally speaking cannabis is such a threat on paper \u2026 hmmm.",

            "text": "Fibromyalgia is a difficult condition to live with, but as we\u2019ve learned from Leafly reviewers, cannabis can offer respite. It makes sense when you look at some of the symptoms fibro sufferers face:\n\nJoint pain\nFatigue\nDepression and anxiety\nTenderness and generalized pain\nInsomnia\nInability to focus\n\n\nThere isn\u2019t a lot of research on cannabis as a treatment for fibromyalgia, but clinical studies using synthesized THC for symptom management shows promising results. Still, there\u2019s plenty of anecdotal evidence in Leafly\u2019s strain reviews alone to show that cannabis is certainly providing much needed relief to many of those willing to experiment. These 10 strains, according to our user-submitted strain data, seem to be doing the trick.\nKeep in mind, relief is not limited to these strains alone. There a lot \u2013 and we mean a lot \u2013 of strains that can treat pain, fight fatigue, reduce depression and anxiety, sharpen focus, and crush insomnia. Consider trying other high-CBD strains, or cannabis in various other forms like edibles, topicals, or ingestible oils. Everyone\u2019s body is different, so the key is to try different strains and products to see what works best for you.\n\n\u00a0\nBlue Dream\n\u00a0\nGiven the sheer volume of strain reviews available for Blue Dream, it\u2019s no wonder that we found so many positive reports associated with this sativa-dominant hybrid from fibro patients. However, that\u2019s not a reason to discount the therapeutic potential of this coveted berry-flavored flower; Blue Dream is known to exhibit high levels of the relaxing terpene myrcene as well as CBG, a cannabinoid known to reduce inflammation and fight insomnia. Not only that, Blue Dream delicately lifts the mood to new heights, letting you forget about the aches and worries that were keeping you down.\n\u201cBlue Dream is my go-to strain for my everyday fibromyalgia pain and muscle spasm medicine, it is gentle enough to use [every] day and throughout the day. It is a nice hybrid, with the muscle spasm easing effects of [an] indica, and the euphoric, headache easing effects of a sativa without anxiety effects. I use it when I wake up to get moving, and even use it to help me sleep.\u201d \u2013 craig_DC\n\u00a0\nHarlequin\n\u00a0\nWith the painkilling power of THC and CBD combined, this sativa is the perfect way to start your day. If you\u2019re sensitive to THC, you\u2019re in luck: Harlequin\u2019s high-CBD content helps curb the psychoactive and anxious side effects of THC, letting you go about your day without that dizzying euphoria that some unaccustomed users find distracting or unpleasant.\n\u201cI take three puffs and get a wonderful body high that takes my pain away. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t notice it anymore\u2026it feels like it\u2019s gone. It makes me SO happy to not feel my pain. Note that I have fibromyalgia and degenerative disc in my lower back, to for me to not be feeling my pain seems like somewhat of a miracle.\u201d \u2013 chasmyn\n\u00a0\nCannatonic\n\u00a0\nIn further testament to the power of high-CBD strains, Cannatonic is the third most celebrated strain from Leafly users with fibromyalgia. It\u2019s only mildly psychoactive due to its CBD dominance, making it an excellent choice for new users. However, even veterans will appreciate this hybrid\u2019s ability to crush pain, anxiety, muscle spasms, and a myriad of other symptoms.\n\u201cI am taking this for Fibromyalgia. This has been the most helpful strain I have found in clearing my mind. Less mind clutter leads to more mental and physical energy.\u201d \u2013 bearcubb\n\u00a0\nCritical Mass\n\u00a0\nCritical Mass is a heavy indica strain whose tingly full-body effects radiate throughout the body, swiftly bowling down pain and stress. This strain sometimes expresses itself with enhanced levels of CBD for even better pain relief. Also preferred for treating depression, insomnia, and muscle spasms, Critical Mass is definitely a strain you\u2019ll want in your medicine cabinet.\n\u201cMy body felt nice and relaxed for the first time in [I don\u2019t know] how long and for sure helped me sleep. Helped with my TMJ too! If you have fibromyalgia issues like I do it\u2019s definitely one to try!\u201d \u2013IrisLight\n\u00a0\nTahoe OG\n\u00a0\nThis is the strain you\u2019ll need for when your fibromyalgia symptoms are keeping you up at night. Tranquilizing and dreamy, Tahoe OG is an indica-dominant strain that leads muscles into blissful relaxation, melting the pain and tension out of them.\n\u201cThis will give the pain killing effects need for heavy pain, as well as give a sedative effect, so one can go to sleep. [It\u2019s] one of the top ten strains I use for my condition.\u201d \u2013 savagec3\n\u00a0\nGranddaddy Purple\n\u00a0\nGuiding you into relief with a sweet berry and grape flavor, Granddaddy Purple is a classic indica strain with potent painkilling properties. Like Blue Dream, GDP boasts high levels of myrcene and CBG to help relax muscles and control pain. Not only does this sweet-tasting indica treat physical symptoms, its pacifying euphoria loosens the grip of stress, anxiety, and depression to help you stay positive.\n\u201cI finally decided to roll a joint of this and some Tahoe OG, and now I\u2019m free of cramps, muscle spasms, shooting pain, nausea, anxiety, etc\u2026It\u2019s rare that I find a strain that will completely help with medical problems, but also help me be happy, become more creative, and stay awake.\u201d \u2013 GanjaGoddess410\n\u00a0\nGSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\n\u00a0\nCoveted for its potency, flavor, and quality of effect, it\u2019s no wonder that fibro patients also found something to love about this award-winning hybrid. GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) is known to have a high THC content, so if you\u2019re new to cannabis or sensitive to THC, be sure to dose low and slow with this hybrid powerhouse.\n\u201cI bought this strain for pain relief and it worked quite well. I suffer from fibro & arthritis and after smoking this for the first time, it seemed to work as well as some pain pills.\u201d \u2013 TONYROSEITTI\n\u00a0\nBlueberry\n\u00a0\nIndicas are wonderful pain relievers, but it isn\u2019t often you find one with a flavor as strong and sweet as Blueberry. Named for its unmistakable ripe berry aroma, this indica delivers a nuanced effects that mellows everything from physical pain to emotional anguish caused by fibromyalgia.\n\u201cWas in so much body pain today due to fibromyalgia, so I picked up Blueberry wax this afternoon\u2026can safely say this is the best strain for body and migraine pain I\u2019ve tried so far. I melted into my bed, very dreamy effect.\u201d \u2013 cholladay\n\u00a0\nBubba Kush\n\u00a0\nThe symptoms of fibromyalgia are multifaceted, but thankfully, so are the effects of Bubba Kush. Muscles relax. Eyelids heavy. The mind goes from a running pace to walking. Bubba Kush bestows its gift of relief alongside a sweet, earthy coffee aroma with subtle woody notes that will keep you coming back for more even after your symptoms subside.\n\u201cHelps me sleep great which is godsend for severe fibromyalgia\u2026working great for my awful bee stinging feeling nerve pain!\u201d \u2013 Anonymous\n\u00a0\nHeadband\n\u00a0\nNamed for its hugging cerebral sensations some refer to as the \u201chalo effect,\u201d Headband is a favorite for those suffering from headaches. But that\u2019s not the only type of relief this fragrant hybrid has to offer. Headband\u2019s rich terpene profile gives rise to a spectrum of benefits, including stress reduction, mood enhancement, a feeling of wakefulness and focus, and muscle relaxation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great strain, knocked out my knee pain that is causing a fibromyalgia flare up. It\u2019s definitely is easing the flare up as well and the migraine associated with it.\u201d \u2013 Paraleash",

            "text": "I currently have a brain tumor and this was recommended to help as it had a high cbd and wasn't too high of a thc for me being new to the game( and obviously unwell)  I also currently have been suffering from a horrible speech impediment that sounded like a female Forest Gump/stroke patient and I had had that problem from the tumor. I took two small hits off this strain and for four hours my completely normal speech came back!!!!! My leg arm and face numbness and tingling disappeared. I felt happy ( even though they just told me I've got a frigging brain tumor this  morning ) I got to talk to my daughter for her birthday in my normal voice and not scare her which made her so happy because she thought I was all better and at least healing! And it gave me hope!!!! I was not super high- I felt pleasant, functional, energetic, and ready to fight this fight for my family and I! Honestly- I could be a poster child for marijuana- if you hear my voice not on the weed and immediately following one or two hits!?!? Night and day!!!!! It was a miracle! That's what it can do for my nerve tissue in my brain then I don't doubt it's helping my tumor as well! God I didn't wait for the doctors to get their crap together they are still working on making phone calls.... I'm sure they will catch up to me at some point... Eye roll. Maybe by the time they actually get surgery scheduled I won't have much left \ud83d\ude1c\n",
