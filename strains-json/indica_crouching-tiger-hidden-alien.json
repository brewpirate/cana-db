The relaxation and euphoria are intense, bordering on psychedelic. Sends you right to Saturn. That old zepplin album sounds even better. A definite night time or later in the day strain. A bit strong, so beginners may want to use caution. The flower I got was grown by Secret Gardens of Washington, coming in at 28.5% total cannabinoids.",

My job has long hours and it's hard to turn my mind off after a long day. This helps me chill, has a good flavor, and I don't have to smoke a ton of it.\n\nIt doesn't knock me out, but I don't know if I'd recommend it for lightweights. \n\nSecret Gardens of Washington is the grower I've gotten this from.
