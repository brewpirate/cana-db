All the amazing effects of an Indica, but the same wonderful brain buzz from a good, relaxing Sativa strain. super beautiful buds, dense and sticky, and the smoke tastes great! I LOVE LOVE LOVE that this strain doesnt cause me any anxiety (or paranoia), because even some Indicas do... i have really bad anxiety so that may  be why... and some Indicas sort of inadvertently cause me a bit of anxiety, yet with Crown OG i just feel relaxed! GREAT strain for Indica users, and id even recommend this strain to those who are into Hybrids (esp. sativa dominant, because this strain doesnt couch-bound you like a super strong sedating Indica would.) All in all, give it a try! Most clinics in my area, South Orange County carry it regularly! STAY LIFTED, yall!",
