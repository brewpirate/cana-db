            "text": "I like this strain! Makes me very relaxed and sleepy. Perfect for winding down before bed. Slight munchies, but not as much as other strains. Made me fairly giggly and euphoric. I\u2019m not a heavy smoker, so it didn\u2019t take a lot before I felt anything. Tastes VERY fruity, like berry/grape candy. Pretty enjoyable and the medical benefits are great as well; helps with headaches, insomnia, nausea, and pain management. ",
