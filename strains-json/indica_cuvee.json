Surprisingly uplifting for an indica, with intense cerebral effects being felt within 10 minutes. I\u0027m a person that uses indica strains for anxiety and depression, however this particular strain makes me feel a little racy and definitely more absent minded. This strain is good for enhancing the senses, but that awareness can turn into paranoia quickly if the time and setting is not proper. The anxiety and paranoia eventually wanes after the initial come up, but be careful and do not over medicate.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/YEN1LqXiYCOvWiFhmP-4p67iqDM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fY9fB9qHySLml8016ysgJ_goggles-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3285","title":"New Strains Alert: Firewalker OG, Killer Grape, Island Maui Haze, Mt.
