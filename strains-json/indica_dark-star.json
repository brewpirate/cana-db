As a patient of severe and debilitating pain most of my life,  this strain is wonderful. It helps with fibro, nerve and bone pain, sleep, and everything in between. I was able to get this medicine at my local dispensary ONCE. And it went fast, so it must have been grown and handled correctly. If you find some and it doesnt give you the relief I describe, take it back and tell them it is not true Dark Star (u can tell by the smell...nothing quite like it) or their grower is \"off\". This strain works great 4 any pain and will give relief to severe insomniacs as well. All the benefits of a great medicine, WITH ZERO NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS! \nP.S. If the world is to take us seriously, as using cannabis for medicine, we have to stop with the ridiculous naming of strains. (green crack, alien asshat, dogshit, etc) Imagine going to your doctor for an infection. I will bet anyone, there are no antibiotics with names that sound juvenile or are derived from the typical (or stereotypical) \"stoner\". Let us work together in sending the right message to the world about God\u0027s gift to humanity, instead of people laughing at us and giving no validity to mmj as medicine...sorry everybody...but the ridiculous names gotta go. And write your ratings before medicating. Please.\nthank you.
