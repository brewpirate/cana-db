I am partial to indicas, and this certainly fills the bill.  Enjoyable but strong, I used a vaporizer, which eliminated any possible harshness.  It comes on strong and stays with me well ast 2 hours, and the only problem I have is that it has been difficult to obtain.  Highly rated, surprisingly few dispensaries carry it, combining with it's popularity it is hard to find in stock.  Frustrating, as it is immensely helpful with my pain, appetite and sleep.  A must try, first timers might wish to moderate their dosage at first.",
