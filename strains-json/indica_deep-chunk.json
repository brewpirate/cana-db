To do less in the best way possible, you need to create an atmosphere and game plan that fits the mood.\nLuckily, we’ve gone out and done the hard work for you. Just as we did with November 2015\u0027s Netflix release list, we urge you to use our guide to plan out a variety of Netflix and chill sessions for the month of December.\n \n1. Have a #TBT Night\nWatch: F is for Family\nGenre: Animated Sitcom\nChill Situation: The new series created by comedian Bill Burr and written by Michael Price (you might know him as an award-winning writer for The Simpsons) is a family comedy set in the 1970s, “a time when you could smack your kid, smoke inside, and bring a gun to the airport.\" Though it’s based on Burr’s childhood, he actually voices the father, Frank Murphy, while his wife is played by Laura Dern, and his sons by Justin Long and Haley Reinhart. You can check out the trailer to get excited until the six-episode season debuts on December 18.\nSnack of Choice: A TV dinner or a Wonder Bread sandwich only seems fitting.\nVibe: To enhance a nostalgic night in, pick up some Deep Chunk. This strain has roots in Afghanistan and was brought to Northern California in the 1970’s, which means that from the first puff, you’ll recognize that iconic smoke and happy, relaxing stone. For best results, grind up some Deep Chunk for use in your vaporizer.\n \n2. Nurse a Night Out’s Next Day\nWatch: Real Rob\nGenre: Comedy Series\nChill Situation: The eight-episode series starring Rob Schneider is meant to be an exaggerated but honest depiction of his real life and follows him as he manages \"the ups and downs of a Hollywood career,\" according to the release. Let the painfully awkward moments of this show remind you that whatever happened last night couldn’t have been nearly as embarrassing as whatever Schneider experiences. Debuts December 1.\nSnack of Choice: Your favorite breakfast sandwich, enjoyed in bed.\nVibe: After a night out, to ease an aching head and a grumpy belly, check out Blue Moonshine. This strain comes from the famed DJ Short, and with heavy indica roots, it will quell your aches and have you chillaxing and giggling. Blue Moonshine works magic for aches, pains, and appetites — just watch out for any resulting sleepiness.\n \n3. Host a Holiday Gathering\nWatch: A Very Murray Christmas\nGenre: Musical Comedy\nChill Situation: Bill Murray made a Christmas musical, so if you were looking for a holiday miracle this year, chances are this is it. In the story, Murray is putting on a TV variety show but is worried no one will be able to come because of a massive snowstorm hitting New York. With the help of lots of famous friends including George Clooney, Amy Poehler, Miley Cyrus, Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, Jenny Lewis, Chris Rock, and more, the show goes on. It’s directed by Sofia Coppola. There is no way this won’t be incredible. And there is nothing more Murray than this 24-second teaser video. Available December 1.\nSnack of Choice: Cookies! Roasted chestnuts! Hot cocoa!\nVibe: For the perfect complementary strain, look no further than Dutch Treat Haze. With the sociable influence of Dutch Treat combined with the uplifting cerebral effects of Haze, this strain is the perfect balance for socializing with friends and family, laughing your buns off, and chowing down on all the holidays treats your tummy can handle.\n \n4. Throw an Adam Sandler Roast Party\nWatch: The Ridiculous Six\nGenre: Western Comedy\nChill Situation: People have been lamenting and mocking Adam Sandler’s downward trajectory for a while now, but let us not forget that he gave us classics like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy before, you know, agreeing to be in Paul Blart: Mall Cop. The Ridiculous Six is sure to offer some of the absurdity noted in the title as well as some stereotypes, as it’s a satire of western movies from the 1970s. But with a cast including Steve Buscemi, Luke Wilson, Terry Crews, and Will Forte, there are sure to be some laughs. Debuts December 11.\nSnack of Choice: Rare steaks and potatoes.\nVibe: For maximum lolz, check out Hippie Crippler. This sativa-dominant hybrid offers a happy, focused high, along with a relaxing vibe to keep you engrossed in supremely enjoying the movie. If you can find it, Hippie Crippler in concentrate form is a delightfully tasty way to indulge and enhance your funny bone.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12000017/december-2015-netflix-and-chill-your-monthly-guide-to-the-art-of.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/december-2015-netflix-and-chill-your-monthly-guide-to-the-art-of"}],"reviewCount":11,"flavors":[{"name":"Plum","score":50},{"name":"Violet","score":27.5},{"name":"Pine","score":27.5},{"name":"Coffee","score":27.5},{"name":"Rose","score":25}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":35},{"name":"Euphoric","score":30},{"name":"Focused","score":27.5},{"name":"Happy","score":10},{"name":"Sleepy","score":7.5}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Insomnia","score":32.5},{"name":"Depression","score":25},{"name":"Pain","score":5},{"name":"Stress","score":5},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":2.5}],"conditions":[{"name":"PTSD","score":5},{"name":"Anxiety","score":2.5},{"name":"Hypertension","score":2.5},{"name":"Migraines","score":2.5},{"name":"Multiple Sclerosis","score":2.5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":2.5}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/deep-chunk_100x100_8d2e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/514282/b/deep-chunk__primary_2111.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/deep-chunk_100x100_4e29.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/404558/b/deep-chunk__primary_34c0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/deep-chunk_100x100_c126.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/384399/b/deep-chunk__primary_1403.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/deep-chunk_100x100_0014.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/350459/b/deep-chunk__primary_8917.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/deep-chunk_100x100_4928.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/317579/b/deep-chunk__primary_a449.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/deep-chunk_100x100_f3e8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/252213/b/deep-chunk__primary_9ad2.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":6,"popularCities":["Denver, CO","Fraser, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/deep-chunk","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.45454545454545/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":"September","height":null,"averageYield":"Low","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
