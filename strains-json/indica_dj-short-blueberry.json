In honor of Canada Day and the promising strides the country has made towards nationwide legalization, here are 11 strains with Canadian roots. Pick one up and raise a joint to celebrate the friendly Canucks up north!\n \n  Manitoba Poison\nThe Manitoba province is located at the longitudinal center of Canada, so it\u0027s only fitting that Manitoba Poison is a 50/50 hybrid (though you\u0027ll likely feel the heavy indica properties pretty quickly).\n  Sweet Tooth\nAn oldie but a goodie, Sweet Tooth won 1st Place in the 2001 High Times Cannabis Cup.\n  Mendocino Purps\nMendocino Purps, or simply \"The Purps,\" is one of a few living legends that made this list. Handed off as a clone-only cut, this plant was stabilized by BC Bud Depot and has since made its way around the world. \n  Chemo\nChemo, or UBC Chemo, is named for the university where the strain was allegedly created and for its supplementary effects on patients going through chemotherapy. This strain is an international treasure with origins that reach back to the 1970s.\n  M-39\nThe clever astronomical designation of M-39 speaks to the Northern Light #5 portion of this cross. \n  God Bud\nGod Bud is some of the finest around. This incredible indica-dominant strain lives in the pantheon of cannabis deities, but like many of the old gods, this strain is the primogenitor to many other floral demigods like Blue God and Grape God.\n  DJ Short Blueberry\nDJ Short is one of the principal breeders in the cannabis industry. With cuts like Juicy Fruit and Flo, he\u0027s left a lasting mark on the cannabis industry with exotic genetic crosses cultivated through a life of world travel and reverence for this resinous flower. DJ Short Blueberry is known as THE west coast Blueberry phenotype.\n  Blue Dynamite\nBlue Dynamite was featured as one of the top 10 strains of 2007 in High Times magazine. \n  Island Sweet Skunk\nBred by Federation Seed Company in Canada, this beautiful blend of strong landrace genetics offers a smoke that is stimulating and versatile. Known for creating considerable amounts of tertiary CBD, Island Sweet Skunk invigorates the user while still offering anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.\n  Lowryder\nLowryder is a squat and resilient plant that is ideal for outdoor grows in less than pleasant climates, making it a seasoned fit for Canadians seeking a plant that could grow and hide in plain sight while weathering a rugged season. \n  Romulan\nRomulan is a space-age indica sent to Earth to expand our mind. And with Canada\u0027s savvy immigration policy, it\u0027s no wonder this heady smoker stopped there first.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12001518/cannabis-strains-with-canadian-roots.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/cannabis-strains-with-canadian-roots"},{"id":"contentitems-3495","title":"Cannabis Strain Highlight: The Legendary Granddaddy Purple","author":"Will Hyde","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1428422400000)\/","text":"Granddaddy Purple has always held a special place in my heart. Maybe it’s the fruity bouquet of sweet flavors or the powerful, relaxing nature of its indica genetics. Either way, when I find top-shelf, quality GDP, it is hard for me to pass up!\nMy love affair with Granddaddy Purple began in late 2005 while budtending at a Los Angeles-area dispensary. At the time I was on a real sativa kick, and while I enjoy the tropical flavors and cerebral energy they bring, I was struggling to balance my day-to-day anxieties and depression. When a close friend and vendor brought in a fresh batch of Granddaddy Purple, I was blown away by the bulky colas. Something captivated me, but it was more than just the pungent grape aroma. The way the deep violet and dark green hues mesh together under a thick blanket of milky trichomes gives Granddaddy Purple an exaggerated, cartoon-like quality, causing it to become almost a caricature of what I expect cannabis to look like.\n\nGranddaddy Purple was developed as a pain-fighting, sleep-inducing aid for California’s medical marijuana patients. It was introduced in the early 2000s by activist, breeder, and modern day “Medicine Man” Ken Estes, who found himself looking for a safe, smart alternative to pharmaceutical pain management. The strain was bred for its potent psychoactive effects that blanket both mind and body, producing a combination of heady euphoria and full-body relaxation that consumers and medical patients appreciate for nighttime use.\nThis batch of GDP comes from Fremont Gardens in Seattle. When I asked to see their jar of Granddaddy, an excited smile crept across the budtender’s face. She explained how this strain is one of her go-to indicas, and my decision was made all too easy after having my senses conquered by the invigorating aroma exhausted from the bulbous purple buds. After being convinced that I needed to try the DJ Short Blueberry as well, I rushed home to dive into my research!\n\nPopping open the container of Granddaddy Purple launched an assault of berry sweet odor on my living room. The smooth, earthy scent is accented by wood and light citrus notes that capture your attention without shocking the senses. Taking a grinder to this indica-dominant hybrid brought out a piney, evergreen characteristic, while the exhale from the first toke conjured memories of some of my earliest experiences with cannabis. The profile of Granddaddy Purple finished with a creamy spice of flavors ranging from refreshing mint to lightly toasted espresso.\n\nThe Leafly community appreciates GDP’s happy and relaxing effects as a way to keep their mood elevated, avoid stress, and find sleep at the end of a long day. Granddaddy has proven itself as a valuable tool when it comes to appetite stimulation, making it a top choice for those with stomach issues and cancer patients who struggle with the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\nFor me, the effects from Granddaddy Purple revealed themselves with an immediate tingle in my forehead which, by the time I could place it, had already begun circulating throughout the rest of my body. As I stubbed out the remnants of the joint in the ashtray, a deep calming sensation enveloped me into a trance-like state of meditation. Focusing on nothing in particular, I drifted away from the physical and mental pressure that has built up since sunrise. The only thing that snapped me out of my introspection was the hunger building in my stomach.\nWhat about you? Have you tried GDP? How does it affect you? Check the Granddaddy Purple strain details page to find out where this strain is available and leave a review of your experiences. If GDP isn’t the strain for you, start exploring thousands of other cannabis strains and products in the Leafly Explorer. In the meantime, here are a few things the Leafly community is saying about GDP:\n\n\"One of my new favorite indicas. Night time strain for sure. Great for movies and video games and hits very hard once it sets in. Usually wont fall asleep right away and i experience very intense euphoria throughout every inch of my body and takes your mind into space.\" – TheRod3\n\n\n\"I experienced something a little like being a bunny rabbit with wings riding a cloud into an ocean of flowers.\" – timmyp\n\n\n\"Couch lock is real, but you feel at peace.

In honor of Canada Day and the promising strides the country has made towards nationwide legalization, here are 11 strains with Canadian roots. Pick one up and raise a joint to celebrate the friendly Canucks up north!\n \n  Manitoba Poison\nThe Manitoba province is located at the longitudinal center of Canada, so it\u0027s only fitting that Manitoba Poison is a 50/50 hybrid (though you\u0027ll likely feel the heavy indica properties pretty quickly).\n  Sweet Tooth\nAn oldie but a goodie, Sweet Tooth won 1st Place in the 2001 High Times Cannabis Cup.\n  Mendocino Purps\nMendocino Purps, or simply \"The Purps,\" is one of a few living legends that made this list. Handed off as a clone-only cut, this plant was stabilized by BC Bud Depot and has since made its way around the world. \n  Chemo\nChemo, or UBC Chemo, is named for the university where the strain was allegedly created and for its supplementary effects on patients going through chemotherapy. This strain is an international treasure with origins that reach back to the 1970s.\n  M-39\nThe clever astronomical designation of M-39 speaks to the Northern Light #5 portion of this cross. \n  God Bud\nGod Bud is some of the finest around. This incredible indica-dominant strain lives in the pantheon of cannabis deities, but like many of the old gods, this strain is the primogenitor to many other floral demigods like Blue God and Grape God.\n  DJ Short Blueberry\nDJ Short is one of the principal breeders in the cannabis industry. With cuts like Juicy Fruit and Flo, he\u0027s left a lasting mark on the cannabis industry with exotic genetic crosses cultivated through a life of world travel and reverence for this resinous flower. DJ Short Blueberry is known as THE west coast Blueberry phenotype.\n  Blue Dynamite\nBlue Dynamite was featured as one of the top 10 strains of 2007 in High Times magazine. \n  Island Sweet Skunk\nBred by Federation Seed Company in Canada, this beautiful blend of strong landrace genetics offers a smoke that is stimulating and versatile. Known for creating considerable amounts of tertiary CBD, Island Sweet Skunk invigorates the user while still offering anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.\n  Lowryder\nLowryder is a squat and resilient plant that is ideal for outdoor grows in less than pleasant climates, making it a seasoned fit for Canadians seeking a plant that could grow and hide in plain sight while weathering a rugged season. \n  Romulan\nRomulan is a space-age indica sent to Earth to expand our mind. And with Canada\u0027s savvy immigration policy, it\u0027s no wonder this heady smoker stopped there first.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12001518/cannabis-strains-with-canadian-roots.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/cannabis-strains-with-canadian-roots"},{"id":"contentitems-3495","title":"Cannabis Strain Highlight: The Legendary Granddaddy Purple","author":"Will Hyde","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1428422400000)\/","text":"Granddaddy Purple has always held a special place in my heart. Maybe it’s the fruity bouquet of sweet flavors or the powerful, relaxing nature of its indica genetics. Either way, when I find top-shelf, quality GDP, it is hard for me to pass up!\nMy love affair with Granddaddy Purple began in late 2005 while budtending at a Los Angeles-area dispensary. At the time I was on a real sativa kick, and while I enjoy the tropical flavors and cerebral energy they bring, I was struggling to balance my day-to-day anxieties and depression. When a close friend and vendor brought in a fresh batch of Granddaddy Purple, I was blown away by the bulky colas. Something captivated me, but it was more than just the pungent grape aroma. The way the deep violet and dark green hues mesh together under a thick blanket of milky trichomes gives Granddaddy Purple an exaggerated, cartoon-like quality, causing it to become almost a caricature of what I expect cannabis to look like.\n\nGranddaddy Purple was developed as a pain-fighting, sleep-inducing aid for California’s medical marijuana patients. It was introduced in the early 2000s by activist, breeder, and modern day “Medicine Man” Ken Estes, who found himself looking for a safe, smart alternative to pharmaceutical pain management. The strain was bred for its potent psychoactive effects that blanket both mind and body, producing a combination of heady euphoria and full-body relaxation that consumers and medical patients appreciate for nighttime use.\nThis batch of GDP comes from Fremont Gardens in Seattle. When I asked to see their jar of Granddaddy, an excited smile crept across the budtender’s face. She explained how this strain is one of her go-to indicas, and my decision was made all too easy after having my senses conquered by the invigorating aroma exhausted from the bulbous purple buds. After being convinced that I needed to try the DJ Short Blueberry as well, I rushed home to dive into my research!\n\nPopping open the container of Granddaddy Purple launched an assault of berry sweet odor on my living room. The smooth, earthy scent is accented by wood and light citrus notes that capture your attention without shocking the senses. Taking a grinder to this indica-dominant hybrid brought out a piney, evergreen characteristic, while the exhale from the first toke conjured memories of some of my earliest experiences with cannabis. The profile of Granddaddy Purple finished with a creamy spice of flavors ranging from refreshing mint to lightly toasted espresso.\n\nThe Leafly community appreciates GDP’s happy and relaxing effects as a way to keep their mood elevated, avoid stress, and find sleep at the end of a long day. Granddaddy has proven itself as a valuable tool when it comes to appetite stimulation, making it a top choice for those with stomach issues and cancer patients who struggle with the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\nFor me, the effects from Granddaddy Purple revealed themselves with an immediate tingle in my forehead which, by the time I could place it, had already begun circulating throughout the rest of my body. As I stubbed out the remnants of the joint in the ashtray, a deep calming sensation enveloped me into a trance-like state of meditation. Focusing on nothing in particular, I drifted away from the physical and mental pressure that has built up since sunrise. The only thing that snapped me out of my introspection was the hunger building in my stomach.\nWhat about you? Have you tried GDP? How does it affect you? Check the Granddaddy Purple strain details page to find out where this strain is available and leave a review of your experiences. If GDP isn’t the strain for you, start exploring thousands of other cannabis strains and products in the Leafly Explorer. In the meantime, here are a few things the Leafly community is saying about GDP:\n\n\"One of my new favorite indicas. Night time strain for sure.
