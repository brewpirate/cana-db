With glittering trichomes, bright pistils, and lime green and lavender leaves, this strain is a feast for eyes. Its aroma is pungent, sweet, and earthy with slight floral funkiness.

            "text": "Picked this up at Show Grow Ramona ! Worth the Visit, they consistently supply High Quality California Bay Area  strains.  Been waiting to try this one :) This was labeled a \"Hybrid\" at the Dispensary.   Picked up a description of the genetics off of Kushfly.com.  The description as follows:  Do si do is a cross between OGKB Girl Scout Cookies x Face Off OG bx1. It\u2019s a terrific Cookies cross that\u2019s roughly 50% Indica and 50% Sativa. Surely, the best of both worlds!Do Si Do is a potent hybrid strain.  Smells Fruity, Grassy, and a little bit earthy.  The taste is piney and earthy.  Smoked 1/2 a bowl of Flower out of a small glass pipe.  The High on this strain is a TRIP ...:)  The \"Body High came on quick with this one so I thought this would be a more Classic Indica Style High.  Fifteen to Twenty minutes later Miss Sativa awakens from her Slumber and Sinks her Fangs into your Brain.  In the best way possible of course :)  Then its a Duel for Supremacy between Indica and Sativa.  This is the kind of competition I'm talkin bout ! If your out in public and your High on Do-Si-Dos just go with it...don't try to be cool, even with Shades everyone around you knows you are High !  Show Grow Ramona Represent !!!",
