Fairly couch locking but you'll still enough enthusiasm to drive to the shop for supplies.\nPretty short bushy plant with fat leaves during growth, doesn't start producing heaps of visible resin until later weeks of flowering so doesn't start to stink for a while. A plus for those concerned with odour. Has a good bud to leave ratio which means less trimming headaches at harvest time.\nNot sure if this was due to growing methods but I found the dry material to be extremely stinky and flavourful. Dense fruit with a little spice in there somewhere.\nI would recommend for geeks about to watch a trilogy or couples after a chill night with white wine and chocolate.",
