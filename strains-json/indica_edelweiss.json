It keeps my head totally clear while also enabling me to pick up my kids w/o ANY back pain whatsoever. This weed really helps me get through the day without feeling out of it or feeling l,ike just sitting on the couch and not moving. If your looking for that then look for a Indica maybe. :) But, not Edelweiss. This stuff whips the pain while keeping me alert. Now $9g @ MC. When it's gone it's ALL gone for now...",

My anxiety melted right away. I\u2019ve never felt so giggly and happy with a strain. The taste after a fresh hit is incredible. The come down is mellow. Woke up very clear headed the next morning, zero grogginess. I am kicking myself bc I didn\u2019t buy more and can\u2019t find it anywhere. I love it so much I\u2019ve been thinking of growing my own. That\u2019s how much I love this strain. Highly recommended. ",
