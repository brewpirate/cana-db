            "text": "First thanks for Bhang Society in North Hollywood for getting me this new strain.  This is my first review on a flower that deserves to be mentioned. I am also not using an alias as I  stand proudly behind my reviews. From the gate, you will know Emd means business.  Physical layout is gorgeous with heavy carpeted trichomes and fat condensed calyxes.  Smell is like a field of lemon trees planted on newly overturned soil. Effects are enjoyable in the cerebral department but where it shines is the body high. The indica leaps out to set in its staple couch lock. Don't get me wrong, you can still be quite creative on this. I noticed this after staring at my computer screen for 10 minutes straight.  Ok all kidding aside, this flower is heavy on the myrcene so best used as a night time med. I sleep wonderfully on it. Also a side note. I get heavy anxiety on some strains so I mostly use CBD based-strains but Emerald did not have me paranoid. Beware though it is still STRONG. Probably the strongest indica I have had in the \"you ain't going nowhere\" department.  This is my favorite nighttime strain.",
