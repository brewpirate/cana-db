            "text": "I kind of wanted to hate this strain and tried it solely for the name so you can imagine my surprise when it placed within my top 5 favorite strains. \nOur power had been out since 6am due to an ice storm so around maybe 3 or so, my wife and I decided to smoke this and play a board game while our pets snuggled around us for warmth. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had that much fun while in frozen agony in ages! \nWe agreed this was an awesome strain for both of us to treat anxiety and stress. We also agreed to play more board games but with heat and lights. Winning all around!\n\nIf my rambling didn\u2019t give hint to the effects I\u2019ll just list them:\n\u2022Definitely relaxed\n\u2022Uplifted - I have pretty severe depression so this is huge for me and something I\u2019m always looking for.\n\u2022Euphoric\n\u2022Giggly\n\u2022Social\n\u2022Talkative\n\u2022Happy\n\nJust a great mood boost all around.
