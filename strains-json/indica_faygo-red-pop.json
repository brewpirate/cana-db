I don’t think we’ve had that much fun while in frozen agony in ages! \nWe agreed this was an awesome strain for both of us to treat anxiety and stress. We also agreed to play more board games but with heat and lights. Winning all around!\n\nIf my rambling didn’t give hint to the effects I’ll just list them:\n•Definitely relaxed\n•Uplifted - I have pretty severe depression so this is huge for me and something I’m always looking for.\n•Euphoric\n•Giggly\n•Social\n•Talkative\n•Happy\n\nJust a great mood boost all around.
