            "text": "Following the lunar calendar, the 2017 Chinese New Year (also known as the Spring Festival) falls on January 28th. This year rings in the Year of the Fire Rooster (whose last appearance on the Chinese calendar dated back to 1957) and will be accompanied by two weeks of celebration flanked by firework shows and traditional lion dancing.\nThose born under the\u00a0fire rooster are thought\u00a0to exude an attitude of trustworthiness and responsibility while maintaining the rooster\u2019s other positive traits: activeness, popularity, honesty, and loyalty.\nTo join in the celebrations of this Chinese New Year, we decided to pair a few strains that exude the fire rooster\u2019s best qualities.\nMango Haze\n\nSativa Mango Haze packs a fruity punch with its cerebral buzz and mango flavor. Its uplifting qualities speak directly to the fire rooster\u2019s \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cpopular\u201d traits.\nPermafrost\n\nIf this January chill has you turning blue, give the hybrid Permafrost a try. Despite the name, its only frosty elements come from its coat of crystal trichomes. Ease into this this strain for a relaxing body high that will set a joyous mood.\nSage N Sour\n\nSage is a popular \u201clife-giving\u201d herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, so there\u2019s no wonder why the sativa Sage N Sour made a spot on this list. Ring in the new year with a balance of euphoria and energy as you steep in this aromatic strain.\nFlowerbomb Kush\n\nThe indica Flowerbomb Kush won\u2019t knock you out before celebrations are over. It\u2019s \u201cinvigorating cerebral effects\u201d balance out a floaty body high that will cruise you through the Chinese New Year\u2019s two weeks of festivities.\nPeaches and Cream\n\nAdd a little sweetness to your celebrations with the delicious hybrid Peaches and Cream. Possessing a \u201cheady euphoria,\u201d this strain will keep you going through\u00a0glowing nights full of fireworks.",

I had a cold when I tried this in Amsterdam, so that may have caused me to feel the effects of this strain a bit more than most people. After taking a few hits, my body felt super heavy and all of my movements and thoughts seemed to slow. way. down. All I wanted to do was sit in a quite space and nap. While my friend was super hungry after trying this strain, I had the opposite experience. I couldn't get myself to eat anything and while in a restaurant, I ended up giving my food away because I had absolutely no appetite.",

I've written like complex feminist disablity theory while on and it came out grammatically terrible but still made  sense. Not a good vinyl buddy though Doesn't make music crazy or do much for visual effects. Doesn't get rid pain just sort turns your pain into itchy hot feeling. Couldn't get much work done but I felt better painwise next day. It super dense and hard to grind but very potent. Doesn't taste like much either. Smell loud but not sour. I think I would like smoke it regularly and might even buy an 8th which is a lot for me cause I smoke a gram a week. Might mix with edibles to see what it like and will review occurdinyly ",
