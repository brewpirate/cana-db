It's a very purple bud to the core and chock full of orange calyxes and frosty trichromes. It's beautiful to look at, smell, but treats you even better. An Indica dominant strain, this will make you smile and lose track of time and pain while lifting your body into euphoria. I'm glad this strain is gaining popularity, it deserves to be a legendary strain. ",
