    "description": "<p>Foul Mouth by Dungeons Vault Genetics is a clever name for this weird and wonderful strain. Created by crossing Dookies (Diesel x <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gsc\">GSC</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/grandpas-breath\">Grandpa&rsquo;s Breath</a>, this strain inherits both the sweet, pungent aroma of Dookies and the savory funk of Grandpa&rsquo;s Breath. Foul Mouth&rsquo;s buds are dense, bulbous, and covered in trichomes, expressing light tones of purple throughout the foliage, while the effects are mellowing and sedative. This strain is a good option for reducing stress and settling in after a long day.&nbsp;</p>\n",
