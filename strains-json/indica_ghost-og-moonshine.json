I must've had bad bud or was sick or something the first time I did it. This strain is amazing and is now one of my fav indicas out there. Felt super relaxed and helped with a bad headache I had, the high was also amazing. Felt pretty couch stuck this time and pretty much watched a dozen shows on hulu and played video games all night, a vibe night indeed. 5/5",
