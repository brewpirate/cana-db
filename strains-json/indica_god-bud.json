In addition to a number of cow-themed strains such as Alpha Cow, Madcow, Purple Cow, and Afghan Cow, our comely cattle companions have also inspired an oft-used phrase used in many a Leafly review: \u201cHoly cow!\u201d\nIn honor of these dearly beloved domesticated ungulates, here are eight cannabis strains that inspired Leafly reviewers to exclaim \u201cHoly cow\u201d that I\u2019ve helpfully paired with a corresponding gif.\n\u00a0\u00a0Durban Poison\n\u201choly cow I\u2019m flying. no such thing as stress or anxiety with this strain.\u201d \u2013 chaosanon\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Blockhead\n\u201cI hit some of this from a bong along with some crazy dank lemon skunk and then vaped some of this blockhead (all with a friend) and holy cow i was flying high as a kite.\u201d \u2013 chroniccannabisconsumsr\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Kandy Kush\n\u201cHoly cow was a privilege to try out this strain. [\u2026] Probably the smoothest that I have ever smoked.

I ripped three huge hits from a bong and didn\u2019t feel much yet so I killed the bowl, then it hit me \u2026. I had to sit down for a sec and as the high progressed I got more and more energetic and super trippy I dont know how else to describe it but like being in. a 3D movie it was weird and then the world got flat and 2D like it was amazing then as I was coming down I felt like a super hero being ably to switch between reality,2D ,And more real than real 3D movie feeling\u201d \u2013 COMetalHead\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Lemon Haze\n\u201cHoly COW.

I woke up this morning and loaded it up, about 2 hours before I had to go to work, with my last hit about 30 minutes before work. It is a GREAT get up and go, but be warned, you might [not] comprehend what you [are] getting up and going to.

Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: A longtime favorite from British Columbia, God Bud was bred by Jordan of the Islands, who mixed a Canadian strain known as \u201cGod\u201d with Purple Skunk and Hawaiian. God Bud is a powerful indica strain that offers potent medicinal properties and a sweet aroma of berry, lavender, and pine.\nGrow Techniques: This strain can be grown indoors or outdoors in a hydroponic or soil setup. The plants and buds grow dense, so prune and train them to maintain airflow while using trellising to keep ample space between buds. God Bud\u2019s flowers develop loads of sticky resin, making it a great plant for creating\u00a0hash.\nFlowering Time: 7 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: God Bud can handle colder climates, but be careful of high humidity levels as the buds develop. A drop in temperature can cause the buds to take on purple hues, but this strain prefers temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: God Bud can be grown either indoors or outdoors with success.\u00a0\nFeeding: This indica strain requires heavier feeding. Keep the plant happy by top dressing with organic nutrients.",
