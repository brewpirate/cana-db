The plants and buds grow dense, so prune and train them to maintain airflow while using trellising to keep ample space between buds. God Bud’s flowers develop loads of sticky resin, making it a great plant for creating hash.\nFlowering Time: 7 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: God Bud can handle colder climates, but be careful of high humidity levels as the buds develop. A drop in temperature can cause the buds to take on purple hues, but this strain prefers temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: God Bud can be grown either indoors or outdoors with success. \nFeeding: This indica strain requires heavier feeding.

Leafly and General Hydroponics are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: A longtime favorite from British Columbia, God Bud was bred by Jordan of the Islands, who mixed a Canadian strain known as “God” with Purple Skunk and Hawaiian. God Bud is a powerful indica strain that offers potent medicinal properties and a sweet aroma of berry, lavender, and pine.\nGrow Techniques: This strain can be grown indoors or outdoors in a hydroponic or soil setup. The plants and buds grow dense, so prune and train them to maintain airflow while using trellising to keep ample space between buds. God Bud’s flowers develop loads of sticky resin, making it a great plant for creating hash.\nFlowering Time: 7 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: God Bud can handle colder climates, but be careful of high humidity levels as the buds develop. A drop in temperature can cause the buds to take on purple hues, but this strain prefers temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: God Bud can be grown either indoors or outdoors with success. \nFeeding: This indica strain requires heavier feeding. Keep the plant happy by top dressing with organic nutrients.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/22121355/god-bud-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-god-bud-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":510,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":55.752782779505644},{"name":"Pungent","score":55.584997544606317},{"name":"Berry","score":51.532574889507281},{"name":"Woody","score":27.961818628253397},{"name":"Flowery","score":27.226223604517923}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":95.626330004910784},{"name":"Happy","score":74.600998526763789},{"name":"Relaxed","score":56.889425437878543},{"name":"Aroused","score":56.449500736618106},{"name":"Tingly","score":55.733344246194136}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":40.751350466524805},{"name":"Pain","score":40.6255115403503},{"name":"Depression","score":37.098952365362578},{"name":"Inflammation","score":34.288549680798816},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":30.965583565231622}],"conditions":[{"name":"PTSD","score":32.143149451628744},{"name":"Tourette\u0027s Syndrome","score":25.9033802586348},{"name":"Anxiety","score":10.898878703552136},{"name":"Arthritis","score":5.8203061057456216},{"name":"Migraines","score":4.8524717629726632}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":36.466688492388279},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":7.330373219839581},{"name":"Headache","score":2.9843264036667212},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.184277295793092},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.9745457521689311}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/god-bud_100x100_9d06.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1005482/b/god-bud__primary_d094.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/god-bud_100x100_66b0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001798/b/god-bud__primary_c27e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/god-bud_100x100_0dc9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/663948/b/god-bud__primary_f623.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/god-bud_100x100_8188.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/621674/b/god-bud__primary_ea67.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/god-bud_100x100_a369.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/621322/b/god-bud__primary_f235.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/god-bud_100x100_5430.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/597007/b/god-bud__primary_cfd7.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":145,"popularCities":["Montréal, QC","Toronto, ON","Vancouver, BC","Calgary, AB","Edmonton, AB","Winnipeg, MB","Spokane, WA","Hamilton, ON","Tucson, AZ","Halifax, NS"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/god-bud","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.30588235294118/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Hawaiian","subtitle":null,"slug":"hawaiian","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian","symbol":"Haw","applink":"leafly://strain/hawaiian"},{"name":"Purple Skunk","subtitle":null,"slug":"purple-skunk","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-skunk","symbol":"Psk","applink":"leafly://strain/purple-skunk"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Difficult","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":56,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Short","averageYield":"Low","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
