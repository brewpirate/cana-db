I love this strain! This is the PERFECT strain for the daytime. The first time I tried Goldberry I was a bit disappointed thinking \"Why do others like this, I feel very little.\" Then after a little bit I realized that I was very happy, I could still think clearly and focus. I decided to purchase Goldberry again and I discovered  there is not a very strong \"buzz\" but I felt really great! I could think clearly, felt creative,  and noticed, to my great shock, I was pain free, and best of all I was HAPPY!\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely my favorite for daytime. I remained focused and on task. Also, the wax is even better for pain and just as tasty. Did I mention this has a great taste? I was shocked! Delightful!  I am not a fan of the \"taste\" of many strains. Goldberry has an excellent and unique taste! I actually enjoy smoking Goldberry because of the taste!
