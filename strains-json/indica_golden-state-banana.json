Listen - the front of this can boasts a lab tested 30.4% thc - is that even possible? That is by far the highest claim I have heard to date and itâ€™s stamped on the side of the package (can)...Paper planes is a respectable lab and the cans come sealed too, anyway you could tell the quality right away from the fruity/skunky pungent smell that came wafting up when I popped the top to the fluorescent green  buds that look like they are frosted!!! I put a kola in a freshly cleaned bowl and blew my head back with a hemp wick to make sure I got as much terp flavor action as possible, I have an herb vaporizer but I need a new mouthpiece for it, better believe I have a g or two stashed for when I get that replaced - would love to extract from this strain too so reach out if you have the equipment cause I got the Buddha...if you get a chance to taste this Cali tree-fruit nugget - Do It!!!
