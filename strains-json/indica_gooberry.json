            "text": "Again, another entry into my favorite strains. Don't pass this one up!!\n\nInitial thoughts upon smoking this strain: The onset of this strain brings around a warming sensation that centralizes in a point on the forehead. This then spreads to create what I explain as a sauna towel wrapped around the head. This seems to wash over the whole body, but most noticeably on the shoulders and head. Brought a slight sense of tingly arousal.\n\nDuring: The strain continued to bring a deep state of relaxation and warmth. In addition, a focused, meditative tunnel vision ensued. There was a sense of couch lock not due to leaden sluggishness, but from comfort instead. This tunnel vision would not be conducive to instances that require much outward concentration.\n\nDown: Left slightly irritable, due to feeling amazing for so long.\n\nOverall: This strain is perfect for reading a book, listening to music, playing a video game, or meditating. It offers unparalleled relaxation and stress relief. Good for muscle pain!\n\nIt's a sure winner in my book. I was continually recommending this to patients for a wide variety of ailments with a very slim negative list. It felt like a 60i/40s strain. The sativa side left me mentally stimulated and energized. This perfectly accompanies the deep relaxation to stay functional.",
