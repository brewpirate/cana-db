Like most indicas, Gooberry will flower in 7-9 weeks with a short, bushy structure.\u0026nbsp;\n","aka":"Goo Berry","rating":4.31,"highlightedReviews":[{"id":1384750,"username":"OtterOtaku","text":"Again, another entry into my favorite strains. Don\u0027t pass this one up!!\n\nInitial thoughts upon smoking this strain: The onset of this strain brings around a warming sensation that centralizes in a point on the forehead. This then spreads to create what I explain as a sauna towel wrapped around the head. This seems to wash over the whole body, but most noticeably on the shoulders and head. Brought a slight sense of tingly arousal.\n\nDuring: The strain continued to bring a deep state of relaxation and warmth. In addition, a focused, meditative tunnel vision ensued. There was a sense of couch lock not due to leaden sluggishness, but from comfort instead. This tunnel vision would not be conducive to instances that require much outward concentration.\n\nDown: Left slightly irritable, due to feeling amazing for so long.\n\nOverall: This strain is perfect for reading a book, listening to music, playing a video game, or meditating. It offers unparalleled relaxation and stress relief. Good for muscle pain!\n\nIt\u0027s a sure winner in my book. I was continually recommending this to patients for a wide variety of ailments with a very slim negative list. It felt like a 60i/40s strain. The sativa side left me mentally stimulated and energized. This perfectly accompanies the deep relaxation to stay functional.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1622053,"username":"BowlsOPlenty","text":"üí¶üçìüçá as the name suggests gooberry is a lovely flower with tight dense nugs, pungent smell, a flavor between Earth Berry and gas or when I call my favorite!
