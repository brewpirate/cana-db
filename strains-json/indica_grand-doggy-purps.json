I suffer from chronic pain from a severe crushed ankle joint and broken leg. helps with the inflammation too. however, it was just a tad to strong for me. I'm a fairly new smoker so maybe I can grow into it.  I did have a few second hallucination where I was sitting in my car (not driving) and felt like it was moving hahaha. I do feel it's not the best for my anxiety disorder as it does make my heart race quite a bit. overall excellent for pain control. ",
