It was a Kush smell layered with some Afghani over the top. As soon as the scissors touch the surface the smell multiplied throughout the room.\nLook: Very dense, well trimmed lighter green nugs. Nice coating of kif.\nTaste: Not as pungent as the smell but pretty smooth and the Kush taste really takes a backseat to the bold flavor of the GDP.\nRecommendation for medicine: It slowed me right down. Not to a halt but it is definitely winding down stuff during the night for me or if it is for day use, I think it would be one fine escape of a day if needed.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/tAHHcVjF5EvieYWgrsxPA0WBCr8=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fRAbBXkNBSHOIMMxhio7k_wide-brim-red.png"},{"id":1599138,"username":"zojohnson313","text":"love this","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/tAHHcVjF5EvieYWgrsxPA0WBCr8=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fRAbBXkNBSHOIMMxhio7k_wide-brim-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3371","title":"New Strains Alert: Primus, Sour LSD, Strawberry Amnesia, Bubba\u0027s Gift, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1448038800000)\/","text":"New strains have just been added to Leafly\u0027s strain database and they need your reviews! As things cool down outside, snuggle up with Bubba\u0027s Gift or Cherry Grapefruit to get your full-body relaxation on. Motivate yourself to think creatively with Cambodian Haze, Strawberry Amnesia, or Sour LSD. And, of course, celebrate the announcement of Primus\u0027 winter tour with none other than the Primus indica. These strains are just what you\u0027ll need to get through the holidays, so figure out which ones are available near you by checking out the links below!\n \n   1. Primus\n\nPrimus, also called Primus OG, is a complex indica strain that combines Arcata, Trainwreck, and 303 OG. Each parent strain passes on something special to Primus: Arcata with its creative activation, Trainwreck with its long-lasting euphoria, and 303 OG with its sour fruit flavors. This trifecta of duration, fragrance, and quality of high makes for a potent hybrid cherished by patients and recreational consumers alike. For those using cannabis medicinally, consider choosing Primus for evening management of depression, anxiety, appetite loss, or pain relief.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Primus\n \n   2. Sour LSD\n\nSour LSD is a balanced hybrid strain that brings the best of its parent strains: the sour, funky aroma of Sour Bubble and the trippy head space provided by the hybrid LSD. Elevating the senses to new heights, Sour LSD is a great companion strain for enjoying the outdoors or creative activities. This BOG Seeds creation is a nostalgic throwback for all fans of Barney\u0027s Farm\u0027s original LSD, as it carries similar active sativa-like traits only with a little more body relaxation.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Sour LSD\n \n   3. Strawberry Amnesia\n\nA powerful and uplifting flower from Dinafem Seeds, Strawberry Amnesia is a strain made in sativa heaven. Bred from Strawberry Cough and Amnesia, this strain delivers the familiar sweet strawberry and earthy flavors of its parents. Having the typical energizing and euphoric effects of a sativa, Strawberry Amnesia also induces the calming body high from its distant indica relatives. The dark green buds of Strawberry Amnesia are very dense and heavily coated in resin, so this potent sativa should be handled with caution.\n\n \n   4. Bubba\u0027s Gift\n\nDeveloped by Humboldt Seed Organization, Bubba’s Gift is a strain unlike any other. Despite being almost purely indica, this cross between Bubba Kush and God’s Gift produces functional and uplifting effects with a mild body high. Given its strong indica genetics, this sweet, fruity strain is surprisingly well-suited for daytime creative activities. Bubba’s Gift will flower in 6 weeks and can be grown indoors and outdoors.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Bubba\u0027s Gift\n \n   5. Cherry Grapefruit\n\nCherry Grapefruit by Kera Seeds is a super fruity sativa-dominant hybrid that brings out the best qualities of parent strains Cherry and Grapefruit. The effects position themselves with gentle full-body relaxation and a nice head-buzz that would be best for anyone needing muscle relief and mood elevation. This easy-to-grow strain will flower in 9 weeks and is suitable for growing both indoors or outdoors.\n\n \n   6. Cambodian Haze\n\nReeferman Seeds created the vibrant Cambodian Haze sativa by crossing a Cambodian landrace strain with Purple Haze. This South East Asian spin on the classic Purple Haze will deliver a strong euphoric experience without exacerbating paranoia. Known to be extremely sticky in texture and sweet in flavor, Cambodian Haze is the perfect sativa for staying productive without being up all night. Flowering in 11 to 12 weeks, this strain is best suited for indoor and greenhouse grows for an experienced grower.\n\n \n   7. Grandpa Larry OG\n\nAn instant classic from top tier genetics, Grandpa Larry OG is the next elite OG strain. Granddaddy Purple and Larry OG were crossed to create this indica that behaves more like a hybrid. With clear, creative thoughts paired with a subtle relaxing effect, this strain can relieve pain without locking you to the couch. Taking after Granddaddy Purple in growth, these dense dark green and purple buds are covered in trichomes and orange hairs.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Grandpa Larry OG\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12002318/new-strains-alert-primus-sour-lsd-strawberry-amnesia-bubbas-gift.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-primus-sour-lsd-strawberry-amnesia-bubbas-gift"}],"reviewCount":44,"flavors":[{"name":"Pungent","score":8.3017077798861472},{"name":"Grape","score":6.6888045540796961},{"name":"Earthy","score":6.6888045540796961},{"name":"Sweet","score":4.5540796963946866},{"name":"Woody","score":3.7476280834914606}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":96.932321315623014},{"name":"Creative","score":74.161922833649569},{"name":"Euphoric","score":63.31435800126502},{"name":"Happy","score":62.507906388361789},{"name":"Sleepy","score":46.473750790638832}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":46.995572422517391},{"name":"Pain","score":46.189120809614167},{"name":"Depression","score":43.247944339025928},{"name":"Insomnia","score":11.527514231499051},{"name":"Inflammation","score":8.3017077798861472}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":44.576217583807718},{"name":"PTSD","score":40.022137887413024},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":37.887413029728009},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":4.5540796963946866},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":3.7476280834914606}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":15.79696394686907},{"name":"Dizzy","score":4.5540796963946866},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.7476280834914606},{"name":"Headache","score":0.80645161290322576},{"name":"Paranoid","score":0.80645161290322576}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/grandpa-larry-og_100x100_af83.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001226/b/grandpa-larry-og__primary_7e13.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/grandpa-larry-og_100x100_037e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000419/b/grandpa-larry-og__primary_1666.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/grandpa-larry-og_100x100_6437.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/616075/b/grandpa-larry-og__primary_7386.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/grandpa-larry-og_100x100_2099.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/449486/b/grandpa-larry-og__primary_3af0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/grandpa-larry-og_100x100_00da.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/439851/b/grandpa-larry-og__primary_5678.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/grandpa-larry-og_100x100_cfb3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/413616/b/grandpa-larry-og__primary_6301.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":13,"popularCities":["Bend, OR","Denver, CO","Flagstaff, AZ","Sherwood, OR","Willamina, OR","Winslow, AZ"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/grandpa-larry-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.47727272727273/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Granddaddy Purple","subtitle":null,"slug":"granddaddy-purple","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/granddaddy-purple","symbol":"Gdp","applink":"leafly://strain/granddaddy-purple"},{"name":"Larry OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"larry-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/larry-og","symbol":"Log","applink":"leafly://strain/larry-og"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":67,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Short","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
