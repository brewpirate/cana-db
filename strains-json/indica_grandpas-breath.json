            "text": "One of the things that makes every cannabis strain unique is its aroma. From sweet berry and fruit to earthy, herbal, and floral, an attractive fragrance is native to most strains.\nAnd then there are those that, whether by accident or breeder\u2019s intention, inherited flavors that truly challenge the palate. With names like \u201cCat Piss\u201d and \u201cDog Shit,\u201d it\u2019s clear that no one is in denial of this odiferous reality.\nOddly enough, either by novelty or quality of effects, many of these remain staples in the cannabis community despite their strange, borderline terrible aromas.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sour Cheese\nSour Cheese, UK Cheese, Exodus Cheese\u2026all of these strains refer to a lineage characterized by a sour, savory aroma. Offering mellow euphoria that lifts energy and mood, Sour Cheese is a delightful hybrid strain with a funky flavor that most consumers can look past. But with a fragrance this stinky, we see polarized opinions.\nSome love it so much, it inspires poetry. Just magical:\n\n\u201cWhen you open the jar and take a whiff you are greeted with a splash of pungent sour that quickly turns into a smooth cheese. The buds release a satisfying snap that throws trichomes into the air when broken from the stems.\u201d \u2013 Neemix\n\nBut then:\n\n\u201c[S]mells like puke.\u201d \u2013 soop21\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Cat Piss\nThis sativa has a pungent aroma that is reminiscent of ammonia\u2013and thus, cat urine. But there\u2019s a reason Cat Piss keeps getting planted, and it has something to do with the buzzy, stimulating effects considered to be worth the funk, according to many Leafly reviewers.\n\n\u201cBesides the [wretched] taste that leaves you wanting water and a mint, soon you will be too uplifted to care! Effects are amazing and are long lasting.\u201d \u2013misterbest\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re susceptible to paranoia and anxiety like this poor reviewer, maybe avoid this novelty strain altogether:\n\n\u201cYuck. It really does smell like cat piss. Strong, racy sativa. Made me paranoid.\u201d\u00a0\u2013aarvind\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Dog Shit\nSpeaking of animal waste you\u2019d never expect to find yourself smoking, Dog Shit is yet another strain named for its foul-smelling aroma. A hybrid strain most easily acquired in Oregon, its odor doesn\u2019t always come out smelling like sour, funky \u201cdoody pies.\u201d But even when it does, Dog Shit retains an unexpected fan base:\n\n\u201cMy first impressions of the bud were that they were very stinky and definitely lived up to their name however once I smoked it the smell evolved into something more sweet and pleasant.\u201d \u2013 DogeKing\n\nBut, to the shock of absolutely no one, this poopy scented strain ain\u2019t for everyone:\n\n\u201cI got very anxious and paranoid when taking this and it smells kinda bad.\u201d \u2013 BONECRUSHER27\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0M-39\nBased on descriptions from Leafly users, M-39 sounds like Canadian ditchweed grown in a tar pit. And, according to reviews, its aroma is most commonly likened to just that\u2013tar. Some say that its abundance can be attributed to its dull, lackluster aroma that made it easier to smuggle. Across the board, it seems the quality of this strain varies, as well as opinions of it:\n\n\u201cIt has a very strong smell almost a combination of paint and smelly body odor.\u201d \u2013 StoneySundays\n\nBut I guess it isn\u2019t always bad:\n\n\u201c[H]as a soft smoke with notes of peanut butter and fall aroma.\u201d \u2013 ray8753\n\nSo does it taste like tar or warm autumnal cookies? You\u2019ll probably have to wander over to Canada\u2019s black market to find out.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Grandpa\u2019s Breath\nThere\u2019s a slightly musty hint to this strain, but it\u2019s really not as bad as it sounds. Grandpa\u2019s Breath is more aptly named for the Granddaddy Purple genetics used to breed it, but still, expectations set by the name can shape the experience.\n\n\u201cReal nice body high, heavy relaxed head feeling, taste isn\u2019t amazing but isn\u2019t unpleasant either.\u201d \u2013 hazefordayz\n\nBut this reviewer not only loves Grandpa\u2019s Breath \u2013 he/she \u201cloooooves\u201d it:\n\n\u201cThis is one of the best tasting and medicating, fragrant strains I\u2019ve ever had. I looooove Grandpa\u2019s Breath!\u201d \u2013 Strandz\n\nIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a layer of subjectivity when it comes to cannabis flavors\u2013even flavors as unusual and questionable as those explored in this roundup. Although you may never want to try any of these, they do demonstrate the vast aromatic spectrum cannabis has to offer. And that, at the very least, is kind of impressive.",
