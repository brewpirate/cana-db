            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Produced by Apothecary Genetics, Grape Ape was created by crossing Mendocino Purps, Skunk, and Afghani strains. It is known for its large, dense indica-dominant buds. While the name comes from the size, smell, and sometimes the color of the buds, the grape flavor is recognizable and has a heavy-hitting indica high that will help with pain and stress management.\nGrow Techniques: Grape Ape grows well indoors, offering large yields in compact spaces with its short stature and dense buds. The plants will grow dense and thick, so the lower canopy should be cleared to improve circulation and reduce humidity. Hydroponic growing will help keep the plant strong and well-fed to promote big buds.\nFlowering Time: 7-8 weeks\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Plants grow best between 68-80 degrees Fahrenheit. Ideally, keep the humidity low\u2013between 30-40% RH\u2013as the flowers finish.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Indoor growing helps prevent mold in the large dense buds, but Grape Ape can also be grown outside. Growing in a covered outdoor space, like a greenhouse, will help ensure that moisture won\u2019t rot the buds.\nFeeding: Moderate to heavy. Use immune-boosting foods such as compost tea to help prevent powdery mildew in the canopy.",
