The buds were mostly green with very obvious patches of purple. The bud shares the skunky grape smell and taste of grandaddy purple and related strains. Overall, an amazing nighttime strain worthy  of being compared to the relief provided by gdp and kushes.  ",

The effects on the mind were mild and let me keep focus and kept me quite calm, happy and euphoric.  Sedative-like qualities were definitely present.  This is my new answer to having a night-time strain to enjoy that won't put me to sleep half-way through a movie.",
