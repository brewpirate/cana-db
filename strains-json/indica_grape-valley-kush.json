The cultivators knew exactly what they were doing with this one. Dark green and purple buds that were covered in trichomes, literally looks as though they rolled it in sugar! Fruity aroma in the front at first and then you get the kushy smell. The buds were super dense and the smallest nug broke up to a large amount, burned super slow. Same when you smoke, a great grape flavor that lasts throughout. Assisted my back pain in seconds and also boosted by appetite. Beginners may find this strain a bit too heavy but ideal for any seasoned smokes who love strong strains.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1628333,"username":"Norkj","text":"This flower grown by, Shango, is amazing.. Lime green core covered by dark green and purple frosted buds.. Very pleasant, sweet, light berries and sweet grapes kept my nose in the jar.
