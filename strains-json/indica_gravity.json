It's soooo smooth and has a great smell when burnt, like the weed I remember as a young adult.  \r\n\r\nI immediately get relief from neuropathy pain within seconds.  I'm already on Neurontin and it barely touches the pain.  Marijuana has been such a great help for my wife and I.  We can finally sleep at night without twitching and cursing at the shocking, burning, and stabbing pains.    \r\n\r\nIt doesn't make me sleepy, and I stay up till 3AM playing Minecraft and I'm almost 40!  I do get the munchies just before bed, but that's not a problem for me!  ",
