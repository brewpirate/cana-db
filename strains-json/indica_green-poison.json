            "text": "I recently picked up a healthy portion of Green Poison. I was initially drawn to its sweet citrusy and subtle earthy/piney aroma. Its buds are dense but light, with a generous dusting of sticky trichomes that leaves your finger tips smelling of freshly peeled oranges. You don't want to consume it because it is smells so amazing and looks so beautiful... But then you break down! You bust it up, and light it ablaze! Its smoke is mildly thick, but pungent! My initial reaction of the high was that it was a little on the light side for my tastes, which disappointed me slightly. However, within a few minutes my disappointment was replaced with cerebral euphoria and the munchies! It definitely is on the clear side, I never find myself feeling foggy or forgetful, in fact, quite the opposite. The euphoric effects usually dissipate within a few hours leaving you feel extremely relaxed. This is definitely a strain that everyone can enjoy, however, beginners should be aware of its late onset effects. I would recommend this strain to everyone",
