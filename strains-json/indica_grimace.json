It can be a very dank bud when grown and cured properly. I liked it more for the gimmick of smoking a purple bud, I didn't think it was the strongest or best in any way for me at the time- But I've come to remember it as a unique strain in my journal for sure. A must try if you are able to do so. -_-",
