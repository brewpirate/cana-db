These were just uploaded to Leafly\u0027s strain database, which means they\u0027re ready for your user reviews. Let us know which ones you\u0027re on the hunt for, or which ones you\u0027ve tried already!\n \n   1. Green Avenger\n\nThe celebrated breeder Subcool is well-known for his fondness of Brothers Grimm genetics, having used several of their strains in his breeding projects. As a thank you for championing their genetics while they were on a long hiatus from the seed business, the now active Brothers Grimm named a special hybrid after his seed company TGA (The Green Avengers). After finding a special male in a pack of TGA’s Vortex, they decided to cross it with their Genius, one of the most sought after Apollo 11 phenotypes. The result is Green Avenger, a squat, branchy plant with long, sticky colas of tropical, fruity smelling flowers. With notes of pineapple and citrus, Green Avenger delivers a speedy, euphoric rush.\n\n \n   2. Grimmdica\n\nLegendary Canadian breeders Brothers Grimm Seeds are back at it, reworking some of their original genetics and re-releasing classic seed lines that are hoarded and coveted by those in the know. With Grimmdica, they have crossed their heirloom Sensi Hash Plant with their favorite Afghani male to produce a truly old-school indica hybrid. The blissful, tranquilizing euphoria and rich, acrid hash flavor with hints of pine are sure to please lovers of classic indica strains everywhere.\n\n \n   3. Higher Power\n\nHigher Power is a cross between the hybrid strain Geezus and the sativa African Queen bred by Wild Oregon Weed. It has a delicious odor akin to grape Froot Loops and has been measured at 24% THC. This sativa offers a truly stimulating high that will leave you energized and bursting with creativity.\n\n \n   4. Shark Bite\n\nA hybrid from Archive Seed Bank, Shark Bite combines Great White Shark with a Face Off OG backcross into one fast-finishing, easy-to-grow strain. Its fat, sticky colas emit a delicious candied fruit aroma with a hint of skunky OG flavor for good measure. Considered a 50/50 hybrid, Shark Bite typically comes in between 18% and 24% THC and makes excellent concentrates.\n\n \n   5. Hashbar OG\n\nIn the old days of clandestine growing, people found many strains to be unsuitable for stealthy indoor grows. Sativa strains were too large and took too long, while many indica strains smelled too strongly to go unnoticed. Enter the Pacific Northwest Hash Plant, a compact, quick-flowering, low-odor plant that still delivers large yields and tons of resin. Archive Seed Bank crossed this plant with their favorite male, the Face Off OG backcross, to create Hashbar OG, a 70% indica-dominant hybrid that generates THC levels between 20% and 24%. While the smell of this strain is light, it still delivers a nice OG flavor when smoked.\n\n \n   6. Moose and Lobsta\n\nMoose and Lobsta is a 70% sativa-dominant hybrid that produces heavy yields of high-potency flowers in about nine to ten and a half weeks of flowering. It smells strongly of skunk and tropical fruit and has a similar taste with undertones of diesel fuel. Moose and Lobsta provides a very intense high that starts in the head and quickly spreads through the body and limbs, and can be beneficial in treating pain, anxiety, depression, and loss of appetite.\n\n \n   7. 5th Element\n\nElemental Seeds crossed Blackberry with All Spark OG to create this impressive strain. 5th Element produces huge yields of sticky buds that feature a powerful earthy, lemony smell and flavor. The effects are quite strong with a good mix of cerebral and body highs.\n\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/12002134/new-strains-alert-green-avenger-moose-and-lobsta-5th-element-red.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-green-avenger-moose-and-lobsta-5th-element-red"}],"reviewCount":3,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":106.25},{"name":"Sweet","score":6.25},{"name":"Grape","score":6.25},{"name":"Pungent","score":6.25},{"name":"Cheese","score":6.25}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":112.5},{"name":"Happy","score":106.25},{"name":"Sleepy","score":100},{"name":"Tingly","score":100},{"name":"Euphoric","score":12.5}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":112.5},{"name":"Fatigue","score":106.25},{"name":"Headaches","score":100},{"name":"Inflammation","score":100},{"name":"Insomnia","score":12.5}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":6.25},{"name":"Arthritis","score":6.25},{"name":"Cancer","score":6.25},{"name":"Glaucoma","score":6.25},{"name":"Migraines","score":6.25}],"negatives":[],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/grimmdica_100x100_3b23.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001560/b/grimmdica__primary_2d17.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/grimmdica_100x100_ad81.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/674382/b/grimmdica__primary_5513.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Denver, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/grimmdica","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Hash Plant","subtitle":null,"slug":"hash-plant","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/hash-plant","symbol":"Hp","applink":"leafly://strain/hash-plant"},{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
