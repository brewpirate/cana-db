            "text": "I tried finding reviews on this one but there weren't many. I always look for new Indica strains for my various ailments,& decided to give this one a shot. This has a particularly higher CBD content than any other strain I've tried , as well as a lower THC content,at least from what I've read. Somehow this creates a great relief for my constant muscle/joint pains as well as has stimulated appetite & helped me fall asleep for a good 8 hours (which is rare nowadays) I only woke up once or twice. When it comes to how exactly I reacted once i smoked this, I was automatically relieved from head to toe as if I had taken a couple of aspirins i had this relaxed slightly euphoric wave that provided  a calming effect on my ever racing thoughts. \nThis is def for bedtime , NOT for a group setting.

            "text": "It had been about 2 years since I last smoke and got out of smoking due to panic attacks then I tried this strain. It had a good stank on it with a good taste to follow. After consuming the first 30-45 mins were filled with lightheaded paranoia. Then we were off to the races for a fun filled evening of shooting pool, jamming vinyls, and socializing amongst family. It was a solid euphoric buzz and as I suffer from Bipolar and Panic attacks it eliminated both when the medicine finally set in, it\u2019s a very good strain I\u2019d love to try again",
