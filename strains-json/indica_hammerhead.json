I always look for new Indica strains for my various ailments,\u0026 decided to give this one a shot. This has a particularly higher CBD content than any other strain I\u0027ve tried , as well as a lower THC content,at least from what I\u0027ve read. Somehow this creates a great relief for my constant muscle/joint pains as well as has stimulated appetite \u0026 helped me fall asleep for a good 8 hours (which is rare nowadays) I only woke up once or twice. When it comes to how exactly I reacted once i smoked this, I was automatically relieved from head to toe as if I had taken a couple of aspirins i had this relaxed slightly euphoric wave that provided  a calming effect on my ever racing thoughts. \nThis is def for bedtime , NOT for a group setting.
