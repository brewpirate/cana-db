It\u0027s relaxing and you can function well due to its low THC content. I like the IndigoPro version I got at The Farm \u0027cause I can regulate the amount I draw with each pull of the vaporizer. Would highly recommend this for beginner cannabis users and for those looking for a healthy serving of CBD.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":16,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":53.125},{"name":"Woody","score":51.5625},{"name":"Sage","score":50},{"name":"Pungent","score":50},{"name":"Pine","score":50}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":114.0625},{"name":"Happy","score":106.25},{"name":"Uplifted","score":56.25},{"name":"Tingly","score":53.125},{"name":"Energetic","score":51.5625}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":51.5625},{"name":"Pain","score":10.9375},{"name":"Stress","score":7.8125},{"name":"Headaches","score":6.25},{"name":"Inflammation","score":6.25}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":62.5},{"name":"Arthritis","score":53.125},{"name":"Cancer","score":51.5625},{"name":"PMS","score":51.5625},{"name":"Migraines","score":6.25}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dizzy","score":53.125},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":53.125},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":4.6875}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gumbi_100x100_da14.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/438605/b/gumbi__primary_8a7f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/gumbi_100x100_8529.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/394802/b/gumbi__primary_4bcb.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Boulder, CO","Pueblo West, CO","Ridgway, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/harmonia","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.3125/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Pure Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"pure-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/pure-kush","symbol":"Pur","applink":"leafly://strain/pure-kush"},{"name":"LA Confidential","subtitle":null,"slug":"la-confidential","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/la-confidential","symbol":"La","applink":"leafly://strain/la-confidential"},{"name":"Sweet Tooth","subtitle":null,"slug":"sweet-tooth","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/sweet-tooth","symbol":"St","applink":"leafly://strain/sweet-tooth"},{"name":"Juicy Fruit","subtitle":null,"slug":"juicy-fruit","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/juicy-fruit","symbol":"Juf","applink":"leafly://strain/juicy-fruit"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
