            "text": "After you\u2019ve devoured every last ounce of gravy your stomach can handle, doused your pumpkin pie in whipped cream, and are now lying on the couch feeling somewhere between extremely satiated and \"I hate myself,\u201d as Louis CK would put it, I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re thinking what I\u2019m thinking: Some cannabis would be mighty fine right about now.\nAfter a hefty meal loaded with (delicious, delicious) carbs, you\u2019re bound to be feeling bloated, possibly even a little bit nauseous. You think about counteracting your discomfort with some cannabis, but which strains will offer the best digestive aid?\nDon't worry, we're hear to help! Here are some strains to ease your aching tummy after a huge holiday meal.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Thin Mint GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\nThis hybrid cross has some pretty impressive origins \u2013 we all know the famous GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) of legendary status. Cross that with Durban Poison from a continent away in South Africa, and you\u2019ve got a powerhouse combination that will knock any uncomfortable indigestion out solid (although it might knock you out, too). As an added bonus, this strain tastes like a nice minty after-dinner treat!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0SFV OG Kush\nSFV OG Kush is a heavy indica to top all heavy indicas. Of Afghani origins, crossed with OG Kush and SFV OG, this indica has a spicy citrus kick followed by a sleepy stone. Don\u2019t hit this bad boy unless you\u2019re ready to go down for the count.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bay Dream\nLooking for something that\u2019ll settle your tummy but won\u2019t leave you in a coma? Check out this savory sativa. A cross of Blue Dream and Bay 11, Bay Dream has a soothing effect on the stomach, with a cerebral burst of euphoria. This is also an excellent strain if you\u2019re looking for a creative boost to get some work done.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Ringo\u2019s Gift\nRingo's Gift is best for those looking for a dose of pain relief with their relaxation. This peppery strain crosses Harle-Tsu and ACDC for a powerful full-body pain reliever without the stoney couchlock effect. The body buzz is strong, but the cerebral effects are subtle \u2013 you might be talking someone\u2019s ear off for 20 minutes before you notice.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Chemo\nThis strain\u2019s name really says it all. It was conceived to counteract the side effects of chemotherapy, and this is easily the top strain for anyone dealing with nausea, stomach cramping, or a loss of appetite. Keep in mind that Chemo is P-O-T-E-N-T, but it's the perfect choice if you\u2019re looking for a comfy after-dinner snooze.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Blue Hawaiian\nFor a more subtle approach, this combination of the classic Blue Dream and Hawaiian Sativa will smooth out your stomach and give you a happy head high. It's a balanced hybrid, offering a tropical taste of pineapple and a sweet burst of blueberry. After a few puffs, you\u2019ll be feeling super mellow without a care in the world.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Strawberry\nStrawberry flavors highlight another stomach-soothing sativa strain you can try. It's especially good for those who might be prone to anxiety, as Strawberry offers a calm, relaxing buzz without the paranoia that is often common in sativa strains. This one is also a great choice for those who have social anxiety, particularly if your relatives are *ahem* out-staying their welcome.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Pure Kush\nTried and true, this indica is a favorite for those looking to stop their pain dead in its tracks. This is the strain you\u2019ll want if you\u2019re looking to sedate yourself into a sleepy stupor. It starts with a little sativa surge for the first few minutes, followed immediately by a pleasant pressure in your head and face. Once you settle yourself after a little dose of Pure Kush, don\u2019t make any plans because you won\u2019t be moving from your spot for a while.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Maui Bubble Gift\nWith a name like that, this strain sounds a bit discombobulated, but that\u2019s really just because it\u2019s a delightful hybrid composed of the best of all worlds. With origins in Maui Waui, Bubble Gum, and God\u2019s Gift, this strain really is a gift. It's This usually high in CBD, with a pleasantly cerebral buzz from Maui Waui, a blast of pain relief from Bubble Gum, and a gentle, caressing body stone that swoops in at the last minute. Your tummy troubles will soon be forgotten with Maui Bubble Gift!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Hashberry\nThis is a nice indica to try as an indigestion aid that won\u2019t knock you out. Hashberry has resinous buds covered in sticky trichomes, so keep in mind that it\u2019s not a strain for beginners. It has a soothing effect on muscles as well as offers full body relaxation while still allowing some degree of sociability. You\u2019ll be giggly and relaxed without being comatose.\nThere you have it! By now, hopefully you've got your feet up, a smile on your face, and are experiencing blissful satisfaction (hopefully while wearing comfy, stretchy pants). Happy Turkey Day!",

            "text": "If there\u2019s one attribute that distinguishes cannabis from its plant-family counterparts, it\u2019s trichomes,\u00a0the tiny, sticky, white glandular hairs that cover the marijuana flower, giving it a \u201cfrosty\u201d appearance. Though many plants and algae have developed trichomes of one type or another to trap insects or protect themselves against herbivores, when it comes to cannabis, trichomes have become one of the most coveted and used parts of the plant.\n\nWhy, you might ask? Trichomes are the primary source of terpenes and medicinal cannabinoids in the marijuana plant. Once buds are harvested and dried, these terpenes flake off into a light colored, sand-like substance known as kief.\nSince the highest concentration of vital cannabinoids like THC are found inside trichomes, it\u2019s no wonder that growers continuously seek new strains and cultivation techniques that maximize the amount of trichomes on each bud. While grow environment drastically affects the amount of trichomes produced by any cannabis plant, some strains certainly produce more trichomes than others.\n\nTo help you find some\u00a0strains that deliver the best kief, we\u2019ve created this handy little list of 10 trichome-heavy strains.\n\u00a0 Hash Plant\nCharacteristics of Hash Plant:\n\n90% indica\nBreeder: Sensi Seeds\nShort flowering time of 6-8 weeks\n\n\u00a0 G13\nCharacteristics of G13:\n\nIndica\nIndoor flowering time of 8-10 weeks\n\n\u00a0 White Widow\nCharacteristics of White Widow:\n\n50/50 hybrid\nBreeder: Green House Seeds\nIndoor flowering time of 8-10 weeks\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Chemdawg\nCharacteristics of Chemdawg:\n\nHybrid with both sativa and indica phenotypes\nIndoor flowering time of around 8 weeks\n\n\u00a0 OG Kush\nCharacteristics of OG Kush:\n\nHybrid\nIndoor flowering time of 8-9 weeks\n\n\u00a0 White Dawg\nCharacteristics of White Dawg:\n\nIndica hybrid\nIndoor flowering time of 8-10 weeks\n\n\u00a0 Chernobyl\nCharacteristics of Chernobyl:\n\nSativa-dominant hybrid\nBreeder: TGA Seeds\nFlowering time between 8-9 weeks\n\n\u00a0 Sour Diesel\nCharacteristics of Sour Diesel:\n\nSativa\nFlowering time of 10-11 weeks\n\n\u00a0 Hashberry\nCharacteristics of Hashberry:\n\nIndica-dominant hybrid\nBreeder: Mandala Seeds\nFlowering time of 7-9 weeks\n\n\u00a0 Sharksbreath\nCharacteristics of Sharksbreath:\n\nIndica-dominant hybrid\nBreeder: DNA Genetics\nFlowering time of around 9 weeks\n\nPhoto credit: Nickel Bag of Funk via photopin cc",

The next day after my migrane I would have headache and feel like I had been out drinking all night. I have an allergic reaction to asprin and tylenol and ibuprofin does nothing to relieve my symptoms. Last year I decided to get my medical card and try marijuana, because nothing else had worked. The strain that had was hashberry and worked like a miracele. The first thing it did was relieve all pain and then it accellerated my symptoms. Instead of 12 hours, the migraine only lasted 2 hours.
