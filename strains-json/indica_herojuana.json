    "description": "<p>Originally bred by Woodhorse Seeds, Herijuana is a combination of the highly regarded Humboldt County Afghan indica called <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/petrolia-headstash\">Petrolia Headstash</a> and an outdoor hybrid from Kentucky known only as the &ldquo;Killer New Haven&rdquo; strain. This combo was worked by breeders for 15 generations to create an inbred line (IBL), meaning that most of the seeds will grow into plants that are nearly identical. Herijuana produces large dense flowers on an open, stretchy plant, with aromas and flavors ranging from spicy earth and sandalwood to hashy fruit. THC levels have been measured at over 25%, and the high provides a heavy, almost numbing feeling.&nbsp;</p>\n",

The batch I purchased doesn't knock me out right away, but it lays the groundwork very well if needed,and insomnia was one of the reasons I wanted to try it.  Surprisingly, it works more as a fairly quick sleep aid if you smoke smaller quantities.  Last night I smoked a large bowl myself and it was a very trippy high.  I was left immobile, and just enjoyed all of the sensations that took over mind and body.  There is definitely some sativa lurking in there, but not anything racy.  It felt like I had a mask on the upper portion of my face that was massaging my forehead :-) , as sounds flooded and moved my brain and waves surged through my body.  A+ stuff.",
