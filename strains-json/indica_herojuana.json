If you smoke this, be prepared to not be active.  The batch I purchased doesn\u0027t knock me out right away, but it lays the groundwork very well if needed,and insomnia was one of the reasons I wanted to try it.  Surprisingly, it works more as a fairly quick sleep aid if you smoke smaller quantities.  Last night I smoked a large bowl myself and it was a very trippy high.  I was left immobile, and just enjoyed all of the sensations that took over mind and body.  There is definitely some sativa lurking in there, but not anything racy.  It felt like I had a mask on the upper portion of my face that was massaging my forehead :-) , as sounds flooded and moved my brain and waves surged through my body.
