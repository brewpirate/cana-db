I really liked the high i got from this strain, it has a nice pine, berry taste. Something i would wanna smoke during the winter. the high from this strain is a nice \"chill\" high meaning you can get baked of this strain and you can act serious at anytime. so that makes this my fav. strain if im about to go somewhere","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1610918,"username":"Sascoltch","text":"This has a nice sweet taste and I personally a slight slight earthy aftertaste.
