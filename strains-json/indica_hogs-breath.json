            "text": "This week is Crohn\u2019s Disease and Colitis Awareness week.\u00a0For those of you that don\u2019t know,\u00a0Crohn\u2019s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are gastrointestinal disorders in a group of conditions known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\nCrohn\u2019s Disease is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that\u00a0can affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the rectum, although it may skip certain areas of the intestine, leaving some healthy, while other parts suffer.\u00a0Ulcerative Colitis is a very similar disease in the IBD group of disorders, but it only affects the colon, affecting\u00a0only\u00a0the innermost lining of the colon.\u00a0\nThe telltale symptoms of Crohn\u2019s Disease:\n\nPersistent diarrhea\nRectal bleeding\nAbdominal pain and cramps\nConstipation\nUrgent need to move bowels\nSensation of incomplete evacuation or \u201crectal tenesmus\u201d (Hey, you learned a new word!)\n\nOther signs that are associated with IBD:\n\nFever\nLoss of appetite\nWeight loss\nFatigue\nNight sweats\nLoss of menstrual cycle in women\n\nSounds terrible, doesn\u2019t it?\u00a0These are painful,\u00a0life-altering disorders, which is why Crohn\u2019s Disease and Colitis are specified as qualifying conditions for medical cannabis in nearly half of all medical marijuana states.\nThese symptoms can be controlled somewhat through diet, but often cannabis offers some of the best relief for the most severe symptoms \u2013 cramps, nausea, loss of appetite, etc.\nWithout further ado, in honor of Crohn\u2019s Disease and Colitis Awareness Week, here are the top strains for your symptoms:\n\u00a01. Jean Guy\nA fan favorite from our neighbors to the North (Canada, eh?), Jean Guy (pronounced \u201cJawn Gee\u201d) is a sativa-dominant strain known for its high THC content and energizing effects.\u00a0A great one to start your day cramp-free.\n\u00a02. Hog's Breath\nHog\u2019s Breath is a well-known indica with roots in the Kush landrace and is known for its potency against heavy pain and anxiety \u2013 a good strain to relax after a long work day.\n\u00a03. Medicine Man\nMedicine Man lives up to its name by delivering potent pain relief with high levels of both THC and CBD.\u00a0This medicinal strain is closely related to the master of the indica jungle \u2013 White Rhino.\n\u00a04. Hash Plant\nHash Plant is known for an abundance of trichomes and a heavy body stone.\u00a0This indica has a reputation for blissful euphoria, as well as easing pain and inflammation associated with Crohn\u2019s and Colitis.\n\u00a05. Willie Nelson\nWillie Nelson is named for the Red-Headed Stranger himself. This sativa offers a clear-headed, energetic high known to incite creativity, as well as a decent case of the munchies.\u00a0\n\u00a06. Chemo\nChemo is just as sedative as you might imagine \u2013 a heavy body high that\u2019s perfect for chronic pain. Take note: the munchies are strong with this one.\u00a0If you have stomach cramps or trouble eating, this strain will inspire your appetite.\n\u00a07. Lemon Jack\nLemon Jack is born of the famed Jack Herer and Lemon Kush and offers strong psychoactive effects.\u00a0Lemon Jack is a daytime strain as strong as a cup of coffee, but without the harsh stomach irritation.\u00a0Recommended for users who suffer from fatigue.\n\u00a08. Golden Pineapple\nGolden Pineapple is as delightful as it sounds.\u00a0A hybrid cross that delivers uplifting, creative effects with a delicious fruity taste, it\u00a0offers relief from stress and anxiety without causing fatigue.\n\u00a09. Confidential Cheese\nConfidential Cheese is born of the legendary LA Confidential and Exodus Cheese. It offers powerful pain relief, as well as relief from insomnia.\u00a0Great for winding down before bedtime, Confidential Cheese also subdues painful muscle spasms and cramps.\n\u00a010. K2\nK2 is named for the world\u2019s second highest mountain peak, which makes sense, as it comes from two of the greats \u2013 White Widow and Hindu Kush.\u00a0K2 is known to increase appetite and calm nausea without any sedative sleepy effects, making it a great strain for both daytime and evening use.",

            "text": "I'll give this stuff somewhere between an 8.5 and a 9. \r\n\r\nWhen I heard we were picking some up two days ago, my initial reaction was a mix between curiosity and skepticism. I had never heard of 'Hog's Breath' before, and I didn't really get a, \"Wow, that sounds awesome!\", sensation from the name. Nonetheless, when it arrived, we loaded up the standard glass pipes, smoked a good three or four hits....and, slowly realized that our hands were too heavy to take the fifth.\r\n\r\nThe moment I received the bag I shoved my nose in, and was instantly overwhelmed by the perplexity Hog's Breath's smell. It didn't have the slightest whiff of skunk, rather a more pungent and wet odor... but it was more than that. A ghostly after-smell like faint hints of Springtime's orchards and fresh cut lawns lingered in my nose. The buds themselves were tight and dense. Small pockets of orange hairs littered the forest green nuggets, so covered with trichomes that they appear almost blurry on first glance. Still, many strains smell great and are far more intriguing to observe than this particular one, so, into the pipe it goes.\r\n\r\nLike I said, we smoked out of normal medium-sized glass pipes, a medium bowl pack to the head. It goes down smooth but tastes kind of funky. If I had to put a description on it I would say the flavors comparable to eating a dirt-covered plant. Certainly not the best tasting bud I've had, but, it's mellow and smooth! I took a few more hits and...\r\n \r\nIt didn't really take me long at all to notice how high I was. This strain hit me hard and fairly fast, and it continues to do so after 2 days of use. About an half hour after the initial application though inhalation, my creative senses skyrocketed. I couldn't put down my guitar even to smoke a cigarette, and as a rather 'artsy fartsy' person, one of the main qualities I search for in bud is creative enhancement. Don't consider me biased though! This herb is plenty powerful enough to satisfy any connoisseur of fine Cannabis. Make sure you watch out for the cotton-mouth, (it's vicious and persistent) and I've noticed the munchies tend to come in intense spurts. Not too bad for the only downsides if you ask me. \r\n\r\nWith all that said, I wouldn't really recommend this for an amateur toker. There's a possibility they might find it to be a little overbearing. Or, they could think its awesome and have a great time. Who knows?  It depends on the person. \r\n\r\nAnyways, Hog's Breath has completely revived my faith that there are amazingly fire strains out there. I will confidently say this stuff's worth a try. It's powerful, long-lasting, and warmly euphoric, a nice complement to anyone's stash.",
