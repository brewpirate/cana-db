            "text": "Wow. This is an incredible indica. The flavor is amazing, it smells like walking in a field of flowers. Both vaped and smoked, the great flowery taste and citrus accents still came through very clearly. The high? It's a really good couchlock, you'll be veeeery disconnected from reality, so get ready. However, as someone suffering from depression (and social anxiety) I find myself to be very calm and focused when active. It's strange because the couchlock is not present until you stop moving, so you can control it.\nAnyway, highly recommended strain. High in linalool with trace humulene and caryophyllene.",
