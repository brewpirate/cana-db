This strain STINKS due to the amount of trichomes, stink proof baggies needed, goodwich bags will do the smell no defense\nthe flavor is something way different from your usual bud, Woody, mentholy, and, to be honest, it tasted a bit like spice, Game over to be specific.\noverall this weed is an AMAZING painkiller and is excellent for rolling one up for your friends. 9/10\n",

Very euphoric strain with a medium body high. Good daytime smoke that simultaneously relaxes you, but also leaves you  fairly energetic and sociable. Not my absolute favourite but a good flower nonetheless.",
