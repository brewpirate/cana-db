And my immediate response was, \"You know what ol\u0027 Jack Burton always says at a time like this...? Bud tender said, \"Who?\" I said, \"Jack Burton...Me!\" -Bud tender was looking perplexed ðŸ˜•. But, I kept going! I said,\"Ol\u0027 Jack Burton always says...What the hell!\" So, I grabbed an eighth just to give this strain an honest review. It\u0027s an indica-dom strain with benefits that include stress relief and major somatic qualities. This will be a favorite for those looking to add some herbal stimulation to their hump game. Nice pain relief and great smoke.
