I tend to stray more towards heavy indicas as I deal with stomach pain from gastroparesis most of the day.\n\nThis instantly became a top 3 strain I’ve ever smoked. Have just tried flower personally but this is a nice heavy indica. I do find it harder to work the first hour after smoking but then I get in a zone and work better. So I would not recommend smoking this one while u work, at least without knowing u might be close to useless for an hour.\n\nAs I said this one is now on my top 3. It really helps me with my stomach pain and the high lasts me hours and I still feel it. Very highly recommend.
