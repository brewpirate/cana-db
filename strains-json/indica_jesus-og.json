Honestly, it felt psychedelic, provoking the most interesting thoughts.  It\u0027s the kind of strain that motivates you to watch or listen to something intellectually interesting. Your face feels weird, in a good way and you\u0027re smiling...Just a blissful, peaceful, euphoric high.  Definitely buying this again.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"},{"id":1640556,"username":"tiopepelovesweed","text":"I feel like walking on water !!!

For strains with well-documented roots, you can depend on your Leafly app to inform you of those beginnings. Most Leafly strain pages now come complete with lineage information so you can have a better understanding of your strain’s background, effects, and characteristics. For example, maybe you hate the racy cerebral effects commonly found in Haze strains, so knowing whether or not your strain was parented by Haze can help you avoid those effects.\nThink you know the genetics behind some of the most popular cannabis strains? It’s time to put your knowledge to the test! Take the quiz below to see how well you know your cannabis strains. (Don’t be too hard on yourself if you don’t ace it — these are a just few among thousands of strains you may have encountered in your cannabis journeys.)\n\n ","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/12002532/quiz-how-well-do-you-know-strain-genetics-8ded.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/quiz-how-well-do-you-know-strain-genetics-8ded"},{"id":"contentitems-3567","title":"The Leafly Strain Reviews Hall of Fame: The Spanish Boy Band Edition","author":"Sara Dilley","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1406162700000)\/","text":"Ladies and gentlemen, scorpions and crawdads, the time has come once again for another round of the Leafly Strain Review Hall of Fame! This month takes us on an impressive journey through the minds (and innards) of Leafly’s best reviewers, a transport so vivid you might get a contact high.  Empiricism and information are our thing, but sometimes, you just gotta laugh at ALL THE THINGS.\nSo, without further ado, here are the reviews that split our sides during July:\nBlue Dream\nBlue Dream is oversaturated in the market, and this month overrepresented in reviews. But we couldn’t help ourselves. We’re not sure that in tandem these reviews will give you a clear picture of the effects, but we’re confident the laughs will be rolling in. \n\nMy favorite strain gets me floating on clouds… one time I was so high I forgot I was in the woods! I literally thought I was on my couch but no I was in the woods.\nTwo words…Rice Balls.\nLeft me singing Spanish boyband songs on the couch and watching Power Rangers.\n\nMK Ultra\nIn the greatest invention since the bug zapper, we bring you a new, revolutionary product that will LITERALLY zap all your cares away.\n\nYOU WILL GET NOTHING DONE. Fucks Zapper! Kills fucks dead. NO FUCKS. None! Almost too lazy to bang: lots of giggling. Have tacos \u0026 ice cream ready.\n\nPineapple\nA strain so potent, it tops the FBI\u0027s, NSA\u0027s, and CIA’s “Most Wanted” lists.\n\nDocuments leaked by Edward Snowden reveal smoking this strain of marijuana may cause procrastination and acute weed nap syndrome. Read more…\n\nJesus OG\nSometimes you just have to get right with the Lord. (Thanks be to God.)\n\nTrust me when I say, you need Jesus in your life.\n\nBlackberry\nHopefully this reviewer wasn’t trampling through the fire swamp; sticky, sugary, delicious ground would really slow them down if they encounter an R.O.U.S.\n\nFeels like I’m walking through syrup.\n\nSour Diesel\nWhat a coincidence! We generally feel things better when using our five senses, too!\n\nRight now I feel so much pleasure; pleasure from everywhere all the time. I especially feel pleasure when I use any of my five senses. I am now taking big breaths and touching random objects because of this weird pleasure I have from doing it. \n\nBlue Diesel\nNo commentary required.\n\nI can feel it behind my eyeballs, and a slight buzz on my dick. Yes.\n\nMaui Waui\nSometimes a tropical holiday leaves you groggy and girlfriend-less in the morning, but $20 richer! \n\nI smoked this strain yesterday. Motivational, euphoric, citrus-tropical-smelling buds.. yesterday I also coincidentally broke up with my girlfriend, wrote a song, and found $20 rearranging my room. Be careful fellow do-stuff-when-I’m-high—ers.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/12002851/the-leafly-strain-reviews-hall-of-fame-the-spanish-boy-band-editi.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/the-leafly-strain-reviews-hall-of-fame-the-spanish-boy-band-editi"}],"reviewCount":324,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":23.190680766688697},{"name":"Citrus","score":20.636153337739593},{"name":"Flowery","score":11.87871777924653},{"name":"Lemon","score":9.5736946463978843},{"name":"Pungent","score":8.3269993390614676}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":68.07997356245869},{"name":"Happy","score":64.089557171183088},{"name":"Uplifted","score":53.527759418374089},{"name":"Energetic","score":49.068076668869793},{"name":"Relaxed","score":46.144249834765368}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":32.352115003304689},{"name":"Stress","score":28.616159947124917},{"name":"Pain","score":22.813119629874421},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":13.564111037673495},{"name":"Inflammation","score":12.062954395241242}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":17.12822207534699},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":14.854593522802379},{"name":"Arthritis","score":8.002313284864508},{"name":"PTSD","score":7.808988764044944},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":7.0893919365499007}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":23.26090548578982},{"name":"Anxious","score":12.5371777924653},{"name":"Dizzy","score":11.220257766027759},{"name":"Paranoid","score":6.1500330469266355},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":4.3630204890945148}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jesus-og_100x100_6fbf.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/605771/b/jesus-og__primary_57fb.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jesus-og_100x100_acc0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/605770/b/jesus-og__primary_ab89.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jesus-og_100x100_2fa4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/595773/b/jesus-og__primary_8b50.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jesus-og_100x100_28b8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/588339/b/jesus-og__primary_e84f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jesus-og_100x100_214d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/588686/b/jesus-og__primary_0b1f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jesus-og_100x100_e828.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/558355/b/jesus-og__primary_6338.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":52,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Portland, OR","China","San Francisco, CA","Denver, CO","Phoenix, AZ","Spokane, WA","Aberdeen, WA","Bellingham, WA","Bothell, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/jesus-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.56481481481481/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Hell\u0027s OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"hells-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/hells-og","symbol":"Hel","applink":"leafly://strain/hells-og"},{"name":"Jack the Ripper","subtitle":null,"slug":"jack-the-ripper","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/jack-the-ripper","symbol":"Jtr","applink":"leafly://strain/jack-the-ripper"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tTwo main phenotypes: one is high in the terpene Limonene, producing a strong lemon aroma; the second expresses dominant kush characteristics.\u0026nbsp;\n\tTGA Genetics recommends topping early and encouraging round, bushy growth for best results.\n\n"}}
