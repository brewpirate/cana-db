Picked this up and will always have some on hand. As someone who is really anxious and in pain this was perfect. No anxiety but pairs well with Xanax if you’re prescribed it for a great pain relief. Lots of euphoria, full body relaxed and rather clear head at lower doses and is a hyperbolic high so rise carefully. Mine came in at almost 30%.
