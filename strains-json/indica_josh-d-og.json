After doing 2 dabs I decided I wanted to take a bubble bath and for some reason played with some of my old star wars toys. I just turned 29 today & I'm female I don't play with toys in the tub. On this strain I do.\nDefinite couch lock sedation when over indulged, has a sweet & almost chemical taste. \nI suffer from some pretty painful migraines occasionally and this strain actually got rid of one.\nI picked up a half gram by Canamo concentrates @ Nova Dispensary. Offered as a discount strain but UT's excellent quality.",

It outgrew every other strain.  FAST!   This a nice body stone, no so much head, but I like that when I want to sleep.\n\nWill definitely grow again.\n\nFuck I'm ripped...\nG.",
