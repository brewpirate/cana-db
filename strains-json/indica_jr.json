            "text": "I'm going to give a full review of Jagermeister OG (yes Jager is OG) marijuana strain created in Southern Oregon. I known this strain like the back of my hand so without further ado--\n*Origin: Southern Oregon (anyone who tries to take credit for this remarkable strain outside of Southern Oregon is just plain full of shit)\n*Appearance: darker green and purple oblong/pinecone tight buds with purple calyxes throughout with a very even coating of tricombs. Jager is slightly underwleming in bag apeal.\n*Smell: literally licorice and gas\n*Taste: literally licorice and gas.\n*Mold: highly resistant\n*Powdry Mildew: resistant\n*Yield: High\n*Outdoor: fantastic\n*Indoor: very good\n*Difficulty: fairly easy strain to work \n*Potency: thc-  19% cbd- 1.75\n\n**Bottom line: I am a true OG nut and this strain is my favorite strain of all time straight Licorice and gas to the nose and lungs there's no mistaking Jager once you open the bag. Tastes just how it smells. Uplifting and extreley functional high. Not too couch lock, more of a clear than fubar high. But still some couch lock on the back end. If you ever come across this strain grab it up as fast as you can you won't regret it!",

            "text": "it's so much better than waking up not remembering what happened the night before. And there's even a hint of licorice in the smoke. The purple leaves within the bud doesnt mean it has a grape flavor at all. Definitely taste trac3s of back to like Northern Lights ancestry in this strain. Blow the smoke and it doesnt linger too long either except in taste. Nice body high with a little cottonmouth & munchies. Good night.",
