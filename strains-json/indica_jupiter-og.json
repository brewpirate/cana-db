You’ve probably noticed that certain varieties of cannabis help you stay focused and productive while others can send your mind completely off the rails. Finding that perfect focusing strain requires a little self-analysis first: What is it that’s impeding your concentration? Are you disengaged? Do your thoughts race? Think of the below sections as your roadmap to the right strain.\nWe’re still waiting for research to provide more guidance on why cannabis might or might not help someone with ADD/ADHD, but we’re limited mostly to personal anecdotes. It’s not a bad idea to try a few different strains – a high-THC strain, a low-THC strain, high-CBD, balanced THC-CBD, and so on. At the end of this list, you’ll also find some appetite-boosting, sleep-inducing strains for those of you experiencing the negative side effects of stimulant ADD/ADHD medications.\n \nStrains for Mental Energy and Engagement\n \nCinex is the strain you reach for when that cup of coffee didn’t do the job. Providing wired euphoria that feeds creativity, this sativa can rekindle interest in tasks that may otherwise be a drag. Take caution with this one if you’re prone to anxiety and racing thoughts; Cinex can turn that up in some individuals.\n \n \nIt’s famous for a reason. Sour Diesel is one of the highest-rated strains on Leafly for treatment of ADD/ADHD, quite possibly due to its ability to shine a new, engaging light on activities and tasks. Speedy euphoria lets your mind stay nimble, but remember that dosing is key. Overdoing a potent sativa like Sour Diesel can have the opposite of your desired effect.\n\n“It makes your frontal lobe act in ways you could never have imagined. It’s almost like Sour Diesel is a key, a key that opens up whole realms of your mind that you were once ignorant of.”\n \n \nAccording to lore, this sativa was dubbed Green Crack by Snoop Dogg because its effects were so intensely stimulating. Green Crack had to make the list because, in my experience, few other strains can match its energy and focus. It sharpens the senses and brings vibrancy to the dull, all with an enticing tropical citrus flavor.\nClick here to browse more strains with stimulating, focused effects.\n \nStrains for Calming Focus\n \nSometimes what you need to concentrate isn’t a strain that speeds your brain up, it’s one that can slow the brain down. The indica-dominant True OG is touted among reviewers for knocking down stress and distractions for easier focus.\n\n“Comes on kind of slowly. Is a chilling high, but you can easily focus and do things like schoolwork, cleaning, etc.”\n \n \nBlueberry Headband captures the perfect synergy of its two parents. From Headband, it inherits a supercharged cerebral effect that lends a spark of creativity. The Blueberry parent softens the euphoric intensity of Headband, providing a mellow, full-body experience that allows your thoughts run at a more manageable pace.\nClick here to browse more strains with relaxing, focused effects.\n \nStrains for Cognitive Clarity\n \nA cross between Sour Tsunami and Harlequin, Harle-Tsu is a high-CBD strain that contains minimal levels of THC. It eases you into a sober, clear-headed calm as its relaxing effects come with minimal psychoactive impact, so you can keep your cognitive faculties intact. If you’re having trouble finding Harle-Tsu near you, try finding its high-CBD parent strains or close relative, Canna-Tsu.\n\n“A good herb for relaxation. Not much of a cerebral high, but what little high you do get is focused and energetic but calm. Its good to mix with some powerful indicas to even it out.”\n \n \nCalming physical sensations coupled with agile cerebral focus, Harlequin is another high-CBD strain that should be on your radar if concentration is hard to come by. Although this ratio can fluctuate, Harlequin typically expresses a 5:2 ratio of CBD:THC, so expect some euphoric stimulation in the mind.\nClick here to browse more strains with a high CBD content.\n \nStrains for ADD/ADHD Medication Side Effects*\n \nA genetic cross between Blueberry and Hindu Kush, Goo provides the golden trifecta of effects for those treating ADD/ADHD: appetite, sleepiness, and focus. This strain is meant for winding down, which can be difficult if you’re prescribed psychostimulant drugs that may stunt the appetite and keep you tossing and turning at night.\n\n“Currently one of my favorite strains. When my brain is too active I smoke this and it helps calm it down.”\n \n \nJupiter OG is another indica strain that can help restore appetite and restfulness when the side effects of your medications are at their worst. This indica may still provide a little kick of focus, but it should definitely be saved for later in the night when you’re ready to help your brain shut down.\nClick here to browse more appetite-enhancing, sedating strains.\n*Please consult with your doctor if you are being prescribed medication to treat your ADD/ADHD or another medical condition and ask if it’s advisable to supplement your regimen with medical marijuana.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12001420/best-cannabis-strains-for-focus-and-addadhd.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/best-cannabis-strains-for-focus-and-addadhd"}],"reviewCount":145,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":46.153846153846153},{"name":"Pungent","score":29.679487179487179},{"name":"Sweet","score":24.294871794871796},{"name":"Flowery","score":21.025641025641026},{"name":"Lemon","score":20.641025641025642}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":132.62820512820514},{"name":"Euphoric","score":79.038461538461547},{"name":"Happy","score":76.7948717948718},{"name":"Tingly","score":67.435897435897431},{"name":"Sleepy","score":66.089743589743591}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":76.282051282051285},{"name":"Stress","score":73.782051282051285},{"name":"Nausea","score":44.551282051282051},{"name":"Headaches","score":41.92307692307692},{"name":"Inflammation","score":41.153846153846153}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":31.858974358974358},{"name":"Migraines","score":24.807692307692307},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":23.141025641025642},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":21.025641025641026},{"name":"PTSD","score":3.7820512820512819}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":29.358974358974358},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":26.987179487179489},{"name":"Paranoid","score":3.7820512820512819},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.2820512820512819},{"name":"Headache","score":0.51282051282051277}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_a76a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/652207/b/jupiter-og__primary_680c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_0d7d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/584211/b/jupiter-og__primary_3774.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_7d86.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/512335/b/jupiter-og__primary_ec0a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_e9da.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/509466/b/jupiter-og__primary_2db2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_e8e4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/449282/b/jupiter-og__primary_e10f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_4f0f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/416006/b/jupiter-og__primary_b873.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":39,"popularCities":["Detroit, MI","Portland, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Las Vegas, NV","North Las Vegas, NV","Phoenix, AZ","Sun Valley, NV","Sweet Home, OR","Torrance, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/jupiter-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.37931034482759/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

You’ve probably noticed that certain varieties of cannabis help you stay focused and productive while others can send your mind completely off the rails. Finding that perfect focusing strain requires a little self-analysis first: What is it that’s impeding your concentration? Are you disengaged? Do your thoughts race? Think of the below sections as your roadmap to the right strain.\nWe’re still waiting for research to provide more guidance on why cannabis might or might not help someone with ADD/ADHD, but we’re limited mostly to personal anecdotes. It’s not a bad idea to try a few different strains – a high-THC strain, a low-THC strain, high-CBD, balanced THC-CBD, and so on. At the end of this list, you’ll also find some appetite-boosting, sleep-inducing strains for those of you experiencing the negative side effects of stimulant ADD/ADHD medications.\n \nStrains for Mental Energy and Engagement\n \nCinex is the strain you reach for when that cup of coffee didn’t do the job. Providing wired euphoria that feeds creativity, this sativa can rekindle interest in tasks that may otherwise be a drag. Take caution with this one if you’re prone to anxiety and racing thoughts; Cinex can turn that up in some individuals.\n \n \nIt’s famous for a reason. Sour Diesel is one of the highest-rated strains on Leafly for treatment of ADD/ADHD, quite possibly due to its ability to shine a new, engaging light on activities and tasks. Speedy euphoria lets your mind stay nimble, but remember that dosing is key. Overdoing a potent sativa like Sour Diesel can have the opposite of your desired effect.\n\n“It makes your frontal lobe act in ways you could never have imagined. It’s almost like Sour Diesel is a key, a key that opens up whole realms of your mind that you were once ignorant of.”\n \n \nAccording to lore, this sativa was dubbed Green Crack by Snoop Dogg because its effects were so intensely stimulating. Green Crack had to make the list because, in my experience, few other strains can match its energy and focus. It sharpens the senses and brings vibrancy to the dull, all with an enticing tropical citrus flavor.\nClick here to browse more strains with stimulating, focused effects.\n \nStrains for Calming Focus\n \nSometimes what you need to concentrate isn’t a strain that speeds your brain up, it’s one that can slow the brain down. The indica-dominant True OG is touted among reviewers for knocking down stress and distractions for easier focus.\n\n“Comes on kind of slowly. Is a chilling high, but you can easily focus and do things like schoolwork, cleaning, etc.”\n \n \nBlueberry Headband captures the perfect synergy of its two parents. From Headband, it inherits a supercharged cerebral effect that lends a spark of creativity. The Blueberry parent softens the euphoric intensity of Headband, providing a mellow, full-body experience that allows your thoughts run at a more manageable pace.\nClick here to browse more strains with relaxing, focused effects.\n \nStrains for Cognitive Clarity\n \nA cross between Sour Tsunami and Harlequin, Harle-Tsu is a high-CBD strain that contains minimal levels of THC. It eases you into a sober, clear-headed calm as its relaxing effects come with minimal psychoactive impact, so you can keep your cognitive faculties intact. If you’re having trouble finding Harle-Tsu near you, try finding its high-CBD parent strains or close relative, Canna-Tsu.\n\n“A good herb for relaxation. Not much of a cerebral high, but what little high you do get is focused and energetic but calm. Its good to mix with some powerful indicas to even it out.”\n \n \nCalming physical sensations coupled with agile cerebral focus, Harlequin is another high-CBD strain that should be on your radar if concentration is hard to come by. Although this ratio can fluctuate, Harlequin typically expresses a 5:2 ratio of CBD:THC, so expect some euphoric stimulation in the mind.\nClick here to browse more strains with a high CBD content.\n \nStrains for ADD/ADHD Medication Side Effects*\n \nA genetic cross between Blueberry and Hindu Kush, Goo provides the golden trifecta of effects for those treating ADD/ADHD: appetite, sleepiness, and focus. This strain is meant for winding down, which can be difficult if you’re prescribed psychostimulant drugs that may stunt the appetite and keep you tossing and turning at night.\n\n“Currently one of my favorite strains. When my brain is too active I smoke this and it helps calm it down.”\n \n \nJupiter OG is another indica strain that can help restore appetite and restfulness when the side effects of your medications are at their worst. This indica may still provide a little kick of focus, but it should definitely be saved for later in the night when you’re ready to help your brain shut down.\nClick here to browse more appetite-enhancing, sedating strains.\n*Please consult with your doctor if you are being prescribed medication to treat your ADD/ADHD or another medical condition and ask if it’s advisable to supplement your regimen with medical marijuana.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12001420/best-cannabis-strains-for-focus-and-addadhd.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/best-cannabis-strains-for-focus-and-addadhd"}],"reviewCount":145,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":46.153846153846153},{"name":"Pungent","score":29.679487179487179},{"name":"Sweet","score":24.294871794871796},{"name":"Flowery","score":21.025641025641026},{"name":"Lemon","score":20.641025641025642}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":132.62820512820514},{"name":"Euphoric","score":79.038461538461547},{"name":"Happy","score":76.7948717948718},{"name":"Tingly","score":67.435897435897431},{"name":"Sleepy","score":66.089743589743591}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":76.282051282051285},{"name":"Stress","score":73.782051282051285},{"name":"Nausea","score":44.551282051282051},{"name":"Headaches","score":41.92307692307692},{"name":"Inflammation","score":41.153846153846153}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":31.858974358974358},{"name":"Migraines","score":24.807692307692307},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":23.141025641025642},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":21.025641025641026},{"name":"PTSD","score":3.7820512820512819}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":29.358974358974358},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":26.987179487179489},{"name":"Paranoid","score":3.7820512820512819},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.2820512820512819},{"name":"Headache","score":0.51282051282051277}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_a76a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/652207/b/jupiter-og__primary_680c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_0d7d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/584211/b/jupiter-og__primary_3774.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_7d86.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/512335/b/jupiter-og__primary_ec0a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_e9da.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/509466/b/jupiter-og__primary_2db2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_e8e4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/449282/b/jupiter-og__primary_e10f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/jupiter-og_100x100_4f0f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/416006/b/jupiter-og__primary_b873.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":39,"popularCities":["Detroit, MI","Portland, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Las Vegas, NV","North Las Vegas, NV","Phoenix, AZ","Sun Valley, NV","Sweet Home, OR","Torrance, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/jupiter-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.37931034482759/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
