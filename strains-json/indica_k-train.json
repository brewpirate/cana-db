Helps me concentrate and work a while or play music.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":33,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":18.939393939393938},{"name":"Tree Fruit","score":18.939393939393938},{"name":"Lemon","score":17.234848484848481},{"name":"Lime","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Earthy","score":3.4090909090909087}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":140.71969696969694},{"name":"Sleepy","score":122.34848484848484},{"name":"Euphoric","score":61.36363636363636},{"name":"Uplifted","score":24.621212121212118},{"name":"Creative","score":22.916666666666664}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":117.8030303030303},{"name":"Fatigue","score":37.878787878787875},{"name":"Cramps","score":35.037878787878782},{"name":"Pain","score":26.893939393939391},{"name":"Stress","score":26.325757575757571}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":6.8181818181818175},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Migraines","score":2.8409090909090908},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"PTSD","score":2.2727272727272729}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":120.64393939393939},{"name":"Dizzy","score":101.70454545454545},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.9772727272727271},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.7045454545454544},{"name":"Headache","score":0.56818181818181823}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k-train_100x100_56ac.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/562891/b/k-train__primary_ddf2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k-train_100x100_852e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/563018/b/k-train__primary_7ac5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k-train_100x100_a6d2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/135608/b/k-train_825x550_f21e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k-train_100x100_1d71.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/41515/b/k-train_825x550_3ce7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k-train_100x100_0f45.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/39375/b/k-train_825x550_b112.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/k-train_100x100_6449.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/21368/b/k-train_825x550_7d9d.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":9,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/k-train","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.42424242424242/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Trainwreck","subtitle":null,"slug":"trainwreck","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck","symbol":"Tw","applink":"leafly://strain/trainwreck"},{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":63,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
