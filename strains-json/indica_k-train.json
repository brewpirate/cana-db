    "description": "<p>K-Train is a mostly indica strain that was developed by Greenhouse Seeds as a cross between <a href=\"http://leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush\">OG Kush</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck\">Trainwreck</a>. These parents are both popular in their own right and were chosen to try and combine their prized effects: the muscle-relaxant qualities of OG Kush with the lucid mental buzz that Trainwreck induces. Once you get on the K-Train, be prepared to sit back and relax with something creative for a while. Thanks to its potency, it&rsquo;s a popular medical choice to treat depression, stress disorders, and pain for patients who want to relax without total sedation. Still a strong indica, the K-Train hits you hard and fast and may prove to be an intense ride for some. These plants are easy to grow and should flower in 9 weeks with the oversized buds that are characteristic of its Trainwreck lineage. K-Train&rsquo;s Kush genetics dominate the aroma, making it sweet and earthy with a hint of black licorice.</p>\n",

This is some serious medicine and will provide the user with a head numbing, body thumping experience that will make them happy and uplifted. As a medicinal user i find this strain ideal because it lasts a solid 3 hours and stops pain and stress, increases appetite, and decreases anxiety to the point of starring blankly at walls. ",

I enjoy trying to taste the strain and see if my taste buds are aligned with leafly's, and I think the citrus-like taste of K-Train is one of the most obvious ones out there. So good.\nThe mental buzz is good aswell. Helps me concentrate and work a while or play music.",
