You\u2019ll feel the high in your eyes, forehead, and most of your head. This gives a classic \u201cStoney\u201d high and gives your body a nice body buzz. The buds themselves are good in size and somewhat frosty and covered in orange hairs. The smell is earthy, citrusy, and slightly sweet. This is a very nice strain for relaxing but nothing amazing. I\u2019ll still give it a 4.5 Stars ",
