Wow! I\u0027ve been eying this strain at Delta 9 in Van Nuys - researching the shit out of King Kush. And I could not wait until I could taste such a beautiful flower.\r\n\r\nI usually focus on hybrids and sativas as I really love the cranial love I get from them. But today I had to get a gram of the King Kush. This is indica gold... Midas is touching my brain right now and I am blissing out at the mellow vibe that is flowing over me and saturating my bones.\r\n\r\nSticky and dense, with a hint of cheese and musk in the nose. So sticky and dank that I could barely pull apart the nug. My little aluminum diamond grinder took a lot of effort to mince. Damn.\r\n\r\nI vaped a trench on the Magic Flight Box. Candied lemon rind and pine, I would even say spruce. Candied lemon rind and spruce. Sweet even and went down smooth. Exhaling lifted your nose with hints of pine and hash. A cuban cigar of vapes... And then it hits your head.\r\n\r\nWow, does it ever grab your head from the inside, pushing softly outwards. Dry mouth almost immediately, but don\u0027t let that dissuade you. This is a comforting softness that warms you from the inside. Currently listening to dub-step and I am in audible heaven! Then a blanket of pain relief hits your shoulders and drops down into your core. This warms you from the inside out. My tongue and the tips of my fingers and toes are tingling.\r\n\r\nHuge euphoria - massive! Great uplifting and smiles. Warm, soft smiles - maybe just a wicked snicker hiding. And man, this makes me horny (TMI, I know). This is a beautiful high, fade, whatever you want to call this, it is beautiful.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m saving up for an eighth or maybe even splurge and get a 1/4 and make the best damn cookies EVER! (Yes, I\u0027ll save some flower for vape-night.\r\n\r\nIf you find the King Kush - do not pass it up.\r\n\r\nShitfuckatasticka!  (say that three times stoned on the King!)","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sPaGuIbcIjKwcF8O7kQXXoAFJ6s=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fkfmswExdS0yqeEmdLkUQ_nerd-green.png"},{"id":1640169,"username":"Kushman24","text":"My Buds are grape sweet an sour no menthol aroma.

For those of you cannabis consumers who are also fans of The Sawx (or for BoSox fans who are also cannabis consumers — after all, you did have a player on your team named Smoky Joe Wood), what better way to celebrate your beloved team\u0027s third World Series win in 10 seasons than with the following strains:\n1. Cherry Pie\n\nThey say baseball is as American as apple pie, but in honor of Boston\u0027s red-hued winners, we think you should opt for cherry this go around. \n2. East Coast Sour Diesel\n\nNot only do the Sox rule the east coast, they reign supreme over the entire nation.\n3. Dynamite\n\nTo celebrate a dynamite season, of course.\n4. Lifesaver\n\nKnowing how die-hard Boston sports fans are, the Sox\u0027s win may very well have lifted their spirits out of some hard times. \n5. Jillybean\n\nFor Beantown, duh.\n6. Euphoria\n\nRide that wave straight to the victory parade!\n7. Red Haze\n\nI\u0027m guessing this is the current state of the entire city of Boston. \n8. King Kush\n\nThis one\u0027s in honor of the \"King of October,\" David Ortiz, who was awarded MVP.  \n9. Holy Grail Kush\n\nWhat bigger Holy Grail exists in baseball other than a World Series win? \nAnd, of course: \n10. F*cking Incredible\n\nCongratulations, Red Sox! And congrats to the city of Boston. As a native Michigander, I will continue to weep over the Tigers\u0027 continued inability to execute in the playoffs. \nphoto credits: nancydowd, Werner Kunz, kim.rossi, Werner Kunz, Aero Racer E, bunkosquad, sea turtle, ctsilva, joyosity, B Rosen via photopin cc","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/12003036/wicked-awesome-10-strains-to-celebrate-the-boston-red-sox-world-s.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/wicked-awesome-10-strains-to-celebrate-the-boston-red-sox-world-s"}],"reviewCount":312,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":19.630041011619955},{"name":"Sweet","score":14.498367129946077},{"name":"Grape","score":11.982133363712311},{"name":"Flowery","score":11.540214171793119},{"name":"Lavender","score":11.287688919267866}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":84.404666970456432},{"name":"Happy","score":63.041600212652838},{"name":"Creative","score":46.6545150755677},{"name":"Sleepy","score":42.342124250018983},{"name":"Tingly","score":40.8772879167616}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":60.7740943267259},{"name":"Depression","score":42.320289359763045},{"name":"Stress","score":32.005202399939243},{"name":"Insomnia","score":27.044884939621781},{"name":"Nausea","score":19.252677147413991}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":19.09413685729475},{"name":"Hypertension","score":10.841972355130249},{"name":"PTSD","score":9.1592617908407377},{"name":"Arthritis","score":7.4637350953140427},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":7.2240259740259738}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":32.94315333789018},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":15.378408141566034},{"name":"Anxious","score":7.1480785296574769},{"name":"Headache","score":6.3363902179691642},{"name":"Dizzy","score":2.7056277056277054}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/indica/king-kush/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/indica/king-kush/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/king-s-kush_100x100_a7dc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002136/b/king-s-kush__primary_85a1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/king-s-kush_100x100_86ec.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/667530/b/king-s-kush__primary_c87c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/king-s-kush_100x100_a7e8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/579150/b/king-s-kush__primary_b374.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/king-s-kush_100x100_337f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/539827/b/king-s-kush__primary_7822.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/king-s-kush_100x100_877e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/537333/b/king-s-kush__primary_f9b9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/king-s-kush_100x100_7bf5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/516110/b/king-s-kush__primary_142e.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":98,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Toronto, ON","Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Ottawa, ON","Las Vegas, NV","Vancouver, BC","Edmonton, AB","Hamilton, ON","Winnipeg, MB"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/king-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.28525641025641/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":63,"outdoorFinish":"Early October","height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tSuitable for screen of green (SCROG) and low stress training (LST)\n\n"}}
