This strain is definitely something that you would wanna smoke if you know that you are having sex that night.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The major pro that I would with this strain the body high I get from it was spectacular! I made my body feel as it were electric  or on \"fire\" Hormones were all over the place/\n\n2. High last for a long time after smoking a bowl I feel the high on average 3 to 4 hours.\n\n3. Very sweet taste! I love the taste of this strain, so much I could help but to nibble on my nugs a bit. This would be a great strain to make cannabutter.\n\nCons:\n\n1. One of the cons that I personally found for myself was that I was way too hormonal. I times I felt like I couldn\u0027t help myself.  Would not be good to smoke around someone you didn\u0027t trust or don\u0027t wanna sleep with.\n\n2.

Though a 80/20 sativa-dominant strain, Oregon Pinot Noir gives the effects of a couch-locking indica, providing a noticeable body high best served for nighttime consumption.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Oregon Pinot Noir \n \n   6.
