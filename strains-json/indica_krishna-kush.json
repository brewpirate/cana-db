Helping Hands Herbals hit it out of the park with Krishna Kush. This strain combines two of my favorite strains. The medicinal benefits from the Gupta Kush mixed together with the heavy sedating effects from the Lavender strain creates a formidable nighttime medicine for any level of consumer. It\u0027s a fantastic strain for anyone who wants help sleeping or needs help relaxing after a hard day.
