I smoked this strain 9 times & each time I smoked it, it caused me to get a throbbing headache, extreme anxiety/paranoia & fear. Even caused me to be irritable/bad mooded. Not because I was mad about purchasing a strain that caused more bad effects than good effects. This strain did absolutely nothing to help curb my pain. The smell isnt strong & the taste is really earthy. Won't be purchasing this strain again. ",
