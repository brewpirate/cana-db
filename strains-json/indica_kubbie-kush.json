I smoked this strain 9 times \u0026 each time I smoked it, it caused me to get a throbbing headache, extreme anxiety/paranoia \u0026 fear. Even caused me to be irritable/bad mooded. Not because I was mad about purchasing a strain that caused more bad effects than good effects. This strain did absolutely nothing to help curb my pain. The smell isnt strong \u0026 the taste is really earthy. Won\u0027t be purchasing this strain again.
