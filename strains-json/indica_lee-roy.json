But you are listing it as Indica Hybrid.  A couple of reviews cite other sources and list an analysis that indicates Sativa.

Well this little ant found a drop of water in a spoon on my desk into which a chuck of half-smoked Lry had fallen. The littler guy drank his fill and then crawled STRAIGHT away. This s**t can take the zig out of ants.
