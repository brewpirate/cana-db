After both of those failed to relieve any pain I got my hands on some Lee Roy and he can finally get relaxed enough to fall asleep and stay asleep!

            "text": "I love it.. But you are listing it as Indica Hybrid.  A couple of reviews cite other sources and list an analysis that indicates Sativa.  I took it before bed and stayed up all night solving the problems of the world.\nMy internal dope meter points strongly to the Sativa side.  \n   May NOT cause drowsiness ... (lol) .. its great for body pains  and wonderful for depression -- calming, uplifting and euphoria...\n  Perhaps Leafly could cite their research, because I do believe this should be reclassified.  Forgive any mis-spellings ... I'm Lee Roy'ed.  <)\n\nYou know how ants zig-zag around. Well this little ant found a drop of water in a spoon on my desk into which a chuck of half-smoked Lry had fallen. The littler guy drank his fill and then crawled STRAIGHT away. This s**t can take the zig out of ants.  Now if Lry were Indica, the little dope fiend ant would be asleep on his spoon.",
