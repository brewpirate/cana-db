            "text": "Great strain. This one showed up suddenly in Berkeley (I got mine from the CBCB) and boy does it live up to its name! I am a heavy medical user, which can be frustrating because my tolerance is high. It can be difficult to find strains that are strong enough to give me a notable, undeniably medicinal effect. \n\nThis is a couch-lock high, and the CBCB describes this as \"Sedative. Good for sleep\" on its website, while all others are listed as \"good for evening relaxation\" and there absolutely is a difference. You will get munchies, but feel too heavy to get up. You will be on couch lock once you pass the threshold of smoking recreationally. This strain is THE BEST I have smoked for sleeping through chronic pain and even migraines. (If you are a strain connoisseur, think the body effects of Afgoo with the sedative mind lull of Berry White. This is not the genetic make-up of Legend, but I can try to paint a picture.) Everyone who I have introduced this strain to now swears by it.\n\nThe length of high is pretty long too. I was set for two hours before I thought of taking another hit. Then I took another hit and woke up the next morning. My nights of sleep have been great, even with my pinched nerve. One thing I'd say is definitely prep with food before smoking this. You will not want to get up to get it.",
