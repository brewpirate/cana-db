            "text": "I was lucky and got a batch of freshly \"churned\", Liquid Butter from SCSA dispensary.  I took a small bud and broke it up the old fashioned way by using my fingers...and, yes, I smelled my fingers. They had a citrus odor with a hint of pine; a very pleasant odor.  If I had a pound or two of Liquid Butter, I'd rub it all over my body...every nook and cranny.  I lit the bowl, and took three big hits.  I can now understand the moniker, \"Liquid Butter\": 1.)  A slight taste of butter on the tongue upon exhale.  2.) The silky smoothness of the smoke.  3.) The way your body feels after five minutes.  If Liquid Butter's punch does not knock you out, it will stagger you.  A strong and tasty smoke for a lazy afternoon or evening.",
