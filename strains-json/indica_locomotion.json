Rob Ford Kush\n\nA Toronto strain that gets its name from its sensationalized former mayor, Rob Ford Kush is a powerfully sleepy indica strain. Keep this one for a day when you want to get nothing done, because its heavy, sedating effects will keep you stagnant in full relaxation. Its plants bloom with overweight, round buds that exude pungent aromas of lemon and hashy kush.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Doox\n\nDoox is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain bred from Purple Cow and the legendary hybrid Chemdawg. The effects will set in quickly, delivering an intense body buzz coupled with dreamy euphoria.

Nicole Kush\n\nNicole Kush is a 75/25 indica-dominant strain that will satisfy your need for potency as well as flavor. Kosher Kush from DNA Genetics teamed up with the Nicole indica from Marimberos to create a dynamic variety that captures sweet and woody flavors with a touch of lemon. Deep relaxation overtakes the body, leaving the mind calm and introspective. Its buds bloom with chunky calyxes that may take on a stunning blue hue as they mature, depending on the phenotype. A delight for novice cultivators, Nicole Kush is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that gives way to large yields so long as it\u2019s raised indoors, in a greenhouse, or in a warm Mediterranean climate.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Nicole Kush\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.
