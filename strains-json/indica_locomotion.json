I thought so. Check out these seven newly added strains and find out if a shop nearby has it in stock! Don\u0027t forget to leave reviews for the ones you\u0027ve tried so others know what to expect.\n \n   1. Buddha\u0027s Hand\n\nBuddha’s Hand is a sativa-dominant strain that was bred by combining genetics from Lemon Thai and Snow Lotus. Pungent aromas of citrus and wildflowers burst from the dense, trichome-caked buds. Easing stress without the cost of energy, Buddha’s Hand is your perfect daytime companion when you’re in need of a mood boost or focus.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Buddha\u0027s Hand\n \n   2. Locomotion\n\nLocomotion is a 70/30 indica-dominant strain by Heroes of the Farm. A cross between Blue Diesel and Timewreck, this strain delivers a dreamy cerebral high while soothing the body. Locomotion’s sour-smelling buds bloom with deep hues of silvery purple. Novices take caution with this potent indica: a little bit goes a long way.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Locomotion\n \n   3. Rob Ford Kush\n\nA Toronto strain that gets its name from its sensationalized former mayor, Rob Ford Kush is a powerfully sleepy indica strain. Keep this one for a day when you want to get nothing done, because its heavy, sedating effects will keep you stagnant in full relaxation. Its plants bloom with overweight, round buds that exude pungent aromas of lemon and hashy kush.\n\n \n   4. Doox\n\nDoox is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain bred from Purple Cow and the legendary hybrid Chemdawg. The effects will set in quickly, delivering an intense body buzz coupled with dreamy euphoria. Doox flowers typically bloom in pale pastel greens masked by a dense coat of frosty resin. Pungent and skunky, this strain is sure to fill the room with its strong sour aroma.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Doox\n \n   5. Nicole Kush\n\nNicole Kush is a 75/25 indica-dominant strain that will satisfy your need for potency as well as flavor. Kosher Kush from DNA Genetics teamed up with the Nicole indica from Marimberos to create a dynamic variety that captures sweet and woody flavors with a touch of lemon. Deep relaxation overtakes the body, leaving the mind calm and introspective. Its buds bloom with chunky calyxes that may take on a stunning blue hue as they mature, depending on the phenotype. A delight for novice cultivators, Nicole Kush is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that gives way to large yields so long as it’s raised indoors, in a greenhouse, or in a warm Mediterranean climate.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Nicole Kush\n \n   6. Jacked-Up\n\nOriginally bred by Heroes of the Farm, Jacked-Up is a 60/40 sativa-dominant hybrid cross between Jack Herer and Timewreck. It typically provides strong cerebral, uplifting effects ideal for daytime use. These resin-packed flowers boast a spicy, woody aroma with intricate undertones of berry, citrus, peaches, and apricots. As multifaceted as its flavor profile, Jacked-Up buds are a colorful display of lavender and green pastels bursting with orange hairs.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Jacked-Up\n \n   7. West OG\n\nA heavy-handed indica, West OG descends from the famous Chemdawg and a backcrossed Humboldt. West OG’s fluffy, purple-hued buds release a musky diesel aroma reminiscent of the long line of OG strains.
