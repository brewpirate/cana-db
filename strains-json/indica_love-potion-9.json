            "text": "Compared to most other cocktails and mocktails, punches are easy-peasy \u2013 combine all ingredients, stir, chill, and serve. In lieu of extensive preparation, the best punches are simply made by layering complementary flavors, and terpene-laden cannabis adds one more element of both flavor and effect, augmenting the overall experience of classic fall punch drinks.\nThe following autumnal\u00a0drink recipes are adapted to accommodate the addition of cannabis tinctures. While any infused tincture you have on hand will do, we\u2019ve recommended a few specific strains whose terpenes amplify each elixir. If you don\u2019t have any tinctures handy, you can make your own, or check the menus of your favorite local dispensaries to find a place where you can pick one up.\n\nMix up a batch of one of the following, pop the pitcher in your fridge, and enjoy an extra-chill punch at your leisure. Cheers to fall!\nSparkling Sativa-Pear Punch\n\nThis pretty pink punch is ideal for the last few semi-sunny fall afternoons on the patio or porch. Whether you\u2019re expecting company or cozied up on your own, keep plenty on hand so you\u2019re ready whenever autumn calls for something to sip.\n\n2 parts pear nectar or pear juice\n2 parts Prosecco (make this a non-alcoholic punch with sparkling cider or lemon-lime soda)\n1 part cranberry juice\n10 mg-worth of cannabis tincture (suggested strains: sweet Candy Jack, tart Vortex, or floral Alice in Wonderland)\nGarnish: pear slice and/or freshly grated nutmeg\n\nAdapted from Sparking Pear-Prosecco Punch by Delish.\nCanna-Pome-Grapefruit Punch\n\nThis fruity pomegranate-grapefruit concoction marries your cannabis tincture with bright citrus notes and deep dark pomegranate colors and characteristics. It\u2019s bold, beautiful, and guaranteed to put a smile on your face.\n\n2 parts pomegranate juice\n1 part grapefruit vodka (try Deep Eddy, Smirnoff, or Absolut \u2013 or omit the alcohol by subbing in soda water)\n1 part fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice\n10 mg-worth of\u00a0cannabis tincture (suggested strains: fruit-punchy Dream Berry, grapefruit-orangey Citrix, or the descriptively-named Grapefruit)\nGarnish: pomegranate seeds or a grapefruit wheel\n\nAdapted from Pomegranate Grapefruit Punch by A Simple Pantry.\nAutumn Apple Indica Punch\n\nThis non-alcoholic apple punch is bona-fide fall in a glass: at once crisp, cool, juicy, and refreshing, it\u2019s ratcheted up a notch by the addition of an indica-infused tincture. What better way to melt seasonal stress away?\n\n3 parts apple cider\n2 parts cranberry juice\n1 part ginger beer\n10 mg-worth of\u00a0cannabis tincture (suggested strains: apple-vanilla Butter OG, honeyed Cream Caramel, or rich, sweet Love Potion #9)\nSqueeze of fresh lime juice\nGarnish: fresh cranberries and a cinnamon stick\n\nAdapted from Apple Orchard Punch by Allrecipes.\nNote: Always imbibe both cannabis and alcohol responsibly, and never drive after consuming either. When in doubt on the potency of your tincture, start with a small amount and work up \u2013 you can always add more, but you can\u2019t add less.",

Took a hit as soon as I got home and the grogginess and discomfort I had from a long walk home cleared up almost instantly. This is a sweet smelling bud smells infinitely better once busted (I stopped to \"smell the roses\" because it's so pretty). It's delicate scent paired with a mild smoke makes it a very pleasant choice. This strain helped seduced my adhd and BPD sympotoms (anxiety and depression), and it doubled as a lovely pain medication for stomach cramps (FYI ladies!). I highly suggestion trying this strain out!",

            "text": "I was hitting my pipe in the shed at my house, filled Love Potion #9. This strain is amazing, It took away all my stress after one bowl. I then walked inside after smoking that one bowl and realized that the power went out. So I entertained myself for an hour and a half waiting for the power to come back on. I even did some productive activities for a few minutes. One example is that I folded my laundry and put it away. I remember feeling proud after I did that. It's the perfect strain to smoke in the evening because you can still function and do a few things. Perfect for after work or after you've been working hard all day doing whatever.",
