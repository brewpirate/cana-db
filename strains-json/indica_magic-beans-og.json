            "text": "Wow. This strain is unbelievable... I just smoked two blunts with this and I don't know how I'm managing to write this... I'm literally laying upside down on my couch lol. You know what's crazy? Nobody can ever REALLY know what colors look like exactly. There's no way to see something through another person's eyes. I could be looking at a red stop sign, and I can tell the person next to me that the sign is red, but there's no way to tell they see red the way I see red. What is red to me could honesty be like blue to someone else, but if they know it as red, they may see that same stop sign and think that's actually blue. I'm gonna smoke another blunt of this stuff shortly because this is seriously amazing. Super fresh and kinda fruity smelling (imo) out the jar. Nice dense buds too. Don't plan on doing anything after smoking this because my eyelids feel like they're 50 pounds each and it's only 11:34 AM and I'm about to knock the hell out. \n\nGet it. You won't regret it. \nOverall: 9.5/10 ",
