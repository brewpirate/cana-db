            "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Floridians allowed to use medical marijuana are one step closer to being able to smoke it.\nLeon County circuit court Judge Karen Gievers on Tuesday lifted a stay on her May 25 ruling that the Florida Legislature\u2019s provision banning smokable medical marijuana is unconstitutional. The state\u2019s Department of Health had filed an appeal of Gievers\u2019 ruling, which automatically put it on hold. Attorney John Morgan and two patients with terminal illnesses then filed an appeal of that stay.\n\nThe stay will officially be lifted on June 11. Gievers wrote that delaying her ruling any further would create irreparable harm to patients.\nShe also wrote that the stay returns the law to its previous state after voters approved a constitutional amendment in November 2016 allowing the use of medical marijuana.\nWhen the Legislature passed the laws to enact the amendment last year, they included a section banning the sale of products used to smoke marijuana, citing health risks. The laws, signed by Gov. Rick Scott last June, state that patients can use cannabis through vaping and in food, oils, sprays and tinctures.\nMorgan, who led the push for the constitutional amendment, filed a lawsuit challenging the ban two weeks after Scott signed the bill. He was joined in the suit by Cathy Jordan and Diana Dodson, who say that smoking medical marijuana has prolonged their lives.\n\nIn her four-page ruling, Gievers cited the harm that could be caused to Jordan, who has had ALS since 1986, and Dodson, who has had HIV since 1991, if the stay was extended.\n\u201cFirst, they cannot legally access the treatment recommended for them. Second, they face potential criminal prosecution for possession and use of the medicinal substance,\u201d she wrote.\nMorgan asked Gov. Scott on Tuesday via social media to drop his appeals.\n\u201cEvery day you waste taxpayers\u2019 money with this frivolous appeal sick people, veterans, cops, firefighters and cancer patients suffer!\u201d Morgan wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhere is your compassion man?\u201d\n\nEven with the stay being lifted, smokable medical marijuana will not immediately be available for sale at treatment centers. That\u2019s because the Department of Health must come up with rules to cultivate, distribute and sell, which could take several months.\nAs of last Friday there were 117,522 patients and 2,644 doctors in the state\u2019s medical marijuana registry. The Department of Health also says that 94,023 patients have received their ID cards, which allow them to receive cannabis at state-approved treatment centers.\nFlorida Department of Health spokesman Devin Galetta said in a statement that department officials are reviewing the ruling. Any further appeal would be heard in the state\u2019s 1st District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee.\nThe health department is involved in six other cases dealing with medical marijuana, ranging from the process of awarding treatment center licenses to allowing a Tampa man to grow it at home for juicing.",

            "text": "This article is sponsored by Jupiter Research.\n\nAs the market for cannabis oil vaporizers continues to mature, so is the user base. Seasoned vape pen customers are increasingly prevalent and come in all stripes, but they have one thing in common: they\u2019ve tried plenty of pens that didn\u2019t quite cut it.\nA more crowded marketplace means that competition is heating up to keep increasingly savvy consumers coming back. And retaining customers is two tiers of tough for cannabis oil processors\u2014they have to make sure they not only have an impeccably refined product, but also that it\u2019s being delivered consistently.\nVape Pen 101\nVaporizers work by heating a concentrate to its boiling point, vaporizing rather than burning the substance. That process accounts for the clean taste and smooth pull consumers expect from a vaporizer, but achieving it can be a tricky prospect.\nA variety of batteries and vape cartridges from Jupiter Research. (Courtesy of Jupiter Research)\n\u201cWe tested a lot of cartridges that provided one good hit,\u201d says Jupiter Research VP of Engineering David Schuler. \u201cAfter that, they didn\u2019t deliver much vapor, and the vapor they did create often tasted burnt.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because in cartridges where a wick delivers fluid to a heating element, sometimes it doesn\u2019t deliver that fluid as fast as a user is pulling, which can cause the wick to dry out. The result can be a vicious cycle; a dry wick can lead to burning in the cart that can leave residue behind, which may in turn impede fluid delivery even further.\nCarts that don\u2019t perform reliably or only draw properly when held at just the right angle are destined for the kitchen junk drawer, and customers won\u2019t be back to try a poorly performing cartridge a second time.\nTo prevent their pens from being relegated to the same fate as dried-out ballpoints, extra twist-ties, and that set of keys that must open something, many processors are turning to a new twist on an established technology to heat the cannabis distillates just right: ceramics.\n\nWhy Ceramic?\nCeramic heating elements are popping up in more vape pens lately for the same reason they\u2019ve been seeing use in kitchen cookware in recent years\u2014namely, that ceramic elements can reach the high temperatures needed to vaporize cannabis oil without burning the material.\nThat\u2019s a turn away from previous iterations of vaporizer cartridge technology, many of which employ technology originally developed for the e-cigarette industry. The problem is, that technology isn\u2019t always the best answer for cannabis oils.\nCeramic cores prevent thick cannabis oils from burning when heated by vape pen batteries. (Courtesy of Jupiter Research)\n\u201cE-cigarette liquid is not as thin as water, but it\u2019s darned close, and that\u2019s not the case with cannabis oil,\u201d Schuler recalls. \u201cWhen we first started working on these cartridges, we found out pretty quickly that existing e-cig technology wasn\u2019t well-suited to the higher viscosity and higher boiling point of cannabis oils.\u201d\nFree Flow\nJust as a pot of pasta will scorch on the stovetop if you don\u2019t add enough water, the finest cannabis oil in the world will burn and taste rotten if the heating element goes dry. Thick, sticky cannabis oil needs room to flow, and not all ceramics can handle it.\n\u201cThe ceramic we use, CCELL, is porous, kind of like a rigid sponge, which gives it the ability to wick high viscosity fluid,\u201d says Schuler. \u201cWhen you fire these elements, they just keep on going. They never dry out, which allows us to run higher power and make more vapor, without worrying about burning.\u201d\nThat porous ceramic also helps Jupiter\u2019s cartridges breathe better, ensuring that as cannabis oil in the cart is vaporized, air is allowed in to replace it. Proper breathing is a key to getting every last bit of oil in a cart fully vaporized every time.\nThe consistency provided by ceramic heating elements isn\u2019t just limited to a single vape pen. Predictable heating like that provided by Jupiter\u2019s CCELL cores can provide reliable, dependable heating across the whole product line.\n\nThat ensures customers get what they came for\u2014the best version of a processor\u2019s carefully crafted cannabis extract\u2014the first time, every time, no matter what oil they\u2019re using. And since those cannabis extracts keep evolving and getting refined, the team at Jupiter Research is constantly working out new ways to provide great performance for a swelling suite of products.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to watch how these oils are evolving,\u201d says Schuler. \u201cWhen we started, it was with BHO-extracted oils. Now, we\u2019re seeing distillates more frequently. Those are going to perform differently, so we have to make sure we\u2019re always providing the best solutions for a whole variety of materials.\u201d\nA Premium Platform\nAs Schuler and his team work to develop new solutions for vaporizing cannabis oils, they\u2019re also working to broaden the usefulness of their existing devices. Jupiter\u2019s Liquid 9 platform, for instance, is already a popular item among recreational cannabis users, powering vaporizers like the IndigoPro. When Kanabo Research was looking for a device it could use as the foundation for its VapePod\u2014the first vaporizer approved as a medical device in Israel\u2014it found a lot about the Liquid 9 to like.\nJupiter Research technology powers the VapePod, the first medically-cleared cannabis vaporizer. (Courtesy of VapePod)\nBut the company also knew it would need to make some modifications before it would pass muster with Ministry of Health officials. Notably, it needed to be able to meter how patients are using the device and deliver consistent, carefully measured puffs that administer the same amount of vapor every time.\n\u201cThat\u2019s very important for a medical device, because it makes it possible to administer a defined and consistent dose,\u201d says Kanabo Research founder and COO David Sack. \u201cThe team at Jupiter was fantastic to work with as we made the changes we necessary to bring the platform in line with our needs. The result has been a really strong partnership that\u2019s important to us in the long term.\u201d",
