This year rings in the Year of the Fire Rooster (whose last appearance on the Chinese calendar dated back to 1957) and will be accompanied by two weeks of celebration flanked by firework shows and traditional lion dancing.\nThose born under the fire rooster are thought to exude an attitude of trustworthiness and responsibility while maintaining the rooster’s other positive traits: activeness, popularity, honesty, and loyalty.\nTo join in the celebrations of this Chinese New Year, we decided to pair a few strains that exude the fire rooster’s best qualities.\nMango Haze\n\nSativa Mango Haze packs a fruity punch with its cerebral buzz and mango flavor. Its uplifting qualities speak directly to the fire rooster’s “active” and “popular” traits.\nPermafrost\n\nIf this January chill has you turning blue, give the hybrid Permafrost a try. Despite the name, its only frosty elements come from its coat of crystal trichomes. Ease into this this strain for a relaxing body high that will set a joyous mood.\nSage N Sour\n\nSage is a popular “life-giving” herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, so there’s no wonder why the sativa Sage N Sour made a spot on this list. Ring in the new year with a balance of euphoria and energy as you steep in this aromatic strain.\nFlowerbomb Kush\n\nThe indica Flowerbomb Kush won’t knock you out before celebrations are over. It’s “invigorating cerebral effects” balance out a floaty body high that will cruise you through the Chinese New Year’s two weeks of festivities.\nPeaches and Cream\n\nAdd a little sweetness to your celebrations with the delicious hybrid Peaches and Cream.

Its euphoric and relaxed high is similar to that of Hindu Kush, but its flavor is distinctively fruitier.\nGrow Techniques: Like Hindu Kush, this plant stays dense and bushy, resulting in increased yields in small spaces – especially when methods like SOG (sea of green) are used. Prune and trellis diligently to help keep the plants happy and healthy. You can easily fill a greenhouse or indoor space with clones and expect a heavy yield.\nFlowering Time: 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Mango Kush plants handle colder nighttime temperatures well but do poorly with heavy rains while flowering. It’s best to keep Mango Kush between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Performs well indoors or out, as long as humidity is kept at bay.\nFeeding: Heavy feeding with CalMag will help keep this plant growing strong.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/31151916/mango-kush-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-mango-kush-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":413,"flavors":[{"name":"Mango","score":63.617886178861795},{"name":"Citrus","score":27.193926351028214},{"name":"Tropical","score":26.103538976566238},{"name":"Sweet","score":19.026781444285032},{"name":"Pungent","score":13.768531802965088}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":70.927785748445714},{"name":"Happy","score":64.493065518890475},{"name":"Euphoric","score":57.673362027737923},{"name":"Hungry","score":54.326877092300329},{"name":"Sleepy","score":52.685318029650887}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":37.636298421807751},{"name":"Depression","score":27.132950741272122},{"name":"Pain","score":23.450502152080343},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":15.919416547106646},{"name":"Insomnia","score":14.191774270683883}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":23.597560975609753},{"name":"PTSD","score":11.109516977522714},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":8.8175514108082247},{"name":"Migraines","score":3.327355332376853},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":2.8802008608321374}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":52.691296030607369},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":9.4799139167862272},{"name":"Dizzy","score":8.18029650884744},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.929220468675275},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.0784313725490196}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_1645.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000978/b/mango__primary_1786.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_77af.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000560/b/mango__primary_e6d7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_8920.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/672556/b/mango__primary_c0e5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_0a5c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/672529/b/mango__primary_f667.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_34f2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/670801/b/mango__primary_0bf0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_85a8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/639378/b/mango__primary_d0ea.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":119,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Seattle, WA","Eugene, OR","Bend, OR","Calgary, AB","Denver, CO","Detroit, MI","Vancouver, BC","Everett, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/mango","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.11864406779661/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"},{"name":"KC 33","subtitle":null,"slug":"kc-33","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/kc-33","symbol":"K33","applink":"leafly://strain/kc-33"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":52,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":"High","environment":"Outdoor","growNotes":"\n\tLarge sized plants are best suited for outdoor growth\n\tAllow longer flowering outdoors, between 63 and 77 days\n\tFor height management outdoors, halt vegging at 3 weeks and transplant\n\n"}}

Either way, it had the most unique smell I\u0027ve ever experienced.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/tAHHcVjF5EvieYWgrsxPA0WBCr8=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fRAbBXkNBSHOIMMxhio7k_wide-brim-red.png"},{"id":1619868,"username":"ctd1000","text":"very good ","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-15829","title":"Celebrate Chinese New Year With These 5 Strains","author":"Hannah Meadows","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1484677341000)\/","text":"Following the lunar calendar, the 2017 Chinese New Year (also known as the Spring Festival) falls on January 28th. This year rings in the Year of the Fire Rooster (whose last appearance on the Chinese calendar dated back to 1957) and will be accompanied by two weeks of celebration flanked by firework shows and traditional lion dancing.\nThose born under the fire rooster are thought to exude an attitude of trustworthiness and responsibility while maintaining the rooster’s other positive traits: activeness, popularity, honesty, and loyalty.\nTo join in the celebrations of this Chinese New Year, we decided to pair a few strains that exude the fire rooster’s best qualities.\nMango Haze\n\nSativa Mango Haze packs a fruity punch with its cerebral buzz and mango flavor. Its uplifting qualities speak directly to the fire rooster’s “active” and “popular” traits.\nPermafrost\n\nIf this January chill has you turning blue, give the hybrid Permafrost a try. Despite the name, its only frosty elements come from its coat of crystal trichomes. Ease into this this strain for a relaxing body high that will set a joyous mood.\nSage N Sour\n\nSage is a popular “life-giving” herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, so there’s no wonder why the sativa Sage N Sour made a spot on this list. Ring in the new year with a balance of euphoria and energy as you steep in this aromatic strain.\nFlowerbomb Kush\n\nThe indica Flowerbomb Kush won’t knock you out before celebrations are over. It’s “invigorating cerebral effects” balance out a floaty body high that will cruise you through the Chinese New Year’s two weeks of festivities.\nPeaches and Cream\n\nAdd a little sweetness to your celebrations with the delicious hybrid Peaches and Cream. Possessing a “heady euphoria,” this strain will keep you going through glowing nights full of fireworks.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/27164926/chinese-new-year.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/strains-to-celebrate-chinese-new-year"},{"id":"contentitems-35874","title":"Tips for Growing Mango Kush Cannabis","author":"Leafly Staff","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1501542907000)\/","text":"Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: By crossing parent strains Hindu Kush and Mango, the tasty and potent strain known as Mango Kush was created. Its euphoric and relaxed high is similar to that of Hindu Kush, but its flavor is distinctively fruitier.\nGrow Techniques: Like Hindu Kush, this plant stays dense and bushy, resulting in increased yields in small spaces – especially when methods like SOG (sea of green) are used. Prune and trellis diligently to help keep the plants happy and healthy. You can easily fill a greenhouse or indoor space with clones and expect a heavy yield.\nFlowering Time: 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Mango Kush plants handle colder nighttime temperatures well but do poorly with heavy rains while flowering. It’s best to keep Mango Kush between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Performs well indoors or out, as long as humidity is kept at bay.\nFeeding: Heavy feeding with CalMag will help keep this plant growing strong.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/31151916/mango-kush-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-mango-kush-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":413,"flavors":[{"name":"Mango","score":63.617886178861795},{"name":"Citrus","score":27.193926351028214},{"name":"Tropical","score":26.103538976566238},{"name":"Sweet","score":19.026781444285032},{"name":"Pungent","score":13.768531802965088}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":70.927785748445714},{"name":"Happy","score":64.493065518890475},{"name":"Euphoric","score":57.673362027737923},{"name":"Hungry","score":54.326877092300329},{"name":"Sleepy","score":52.685318029650887}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":37.636298421807751},{"name":"Depression","score":27.132950741272122},{"name":"Pain","score":23.450502152080343},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":15.919416547106646},{"name":"Insomnia","score":14.191774270683883}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":23.597560975609753},{"name":"PTSD","score":11.109516977522714},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":8.8175514108082247},{"name":"Migraines","score":3.327355332376853},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":2.8802008608321374}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":52.691296030607369},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":9.4799139167862272},{"name":"Dizzy","score":8.18029650884744},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.929220468675275},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.0784313725490196}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_1645.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000978/b/mango__primary_1786.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_77af.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000560/b/mango__primary_e6d7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_8920.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/672556/b/mango__primary_c0e5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_0a5c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/672529/b/mango__primary_f667.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_34f2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/670801/b/mango__primary_0bf0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango_100x100_85a8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/639378/b/mango__primary_d0ea.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":119,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Seattle, WA","Eugene, OR","Bend, OR","Calgary, AB","Denver, CO","Detroit, MI","Vancouver, BC","Everett, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/mango","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.11864406779661/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"},{"name":"KC 33","subtitle":null,"slug":"kc-33","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/kc-33","symbol":"K33","applink":"leafly://strain/kc-33"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":52,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":"High","environment":"Outdoor","growNotes":"\n\tLarge sized plants are best suited for outdoor growth\n\tAllow longer flowering outdoors, between 63 and 77 days\n\tFor height management outdoors, halt vegging at 3 weeks and transplant\n\n"}}
