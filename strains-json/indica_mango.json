            "text": "Following the lunar calendar, the 2017 Chinese New Year (also known as the Spring Festival) falls on January 28th. This year rings in the Year of the Fire Rooster (whose last appearance on the Chinese calendar dated back to 1957) and will be accompanied by two weeks of celebration flanked by firework shows and traditional lion dancing.\nThose born under the\u00a0fire rooster are thought\u00a0to exude an attitude of trustworthiness and responsibility while maintaining the rooster\u2019s other positive traits: activeness, popularity, honesty, and loyalty.\nTo join in the celebrations of this Chinese New Year, we decided to pair a few strains that exude the fire rooster\u2019s best qualities.\nMango Haze\n\nSativa Mango Haze packs a fruity punch with its cerebral buzz and mango flavor. Its uplifting qualities speak directly to the fire rooster\u2019s \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cpopular\u201d traits.\nPermafrost\n\nIf this January chill has you turning blue, give the hybrid Permafrost a try. Despite the name, its only frosty elements come from its coat of crystal trichomes. Ease into this this strain for a relaxing body high that will set a joyous mood.\nSage N Sour\n\nSage is a popular \u201clife-giving\u201d herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, so there\u2019s no wonder why the sativa Sage N Sour made a spot on this list. Ring in the new year with a balance of euphoria and energy as you steep in this aromatic strain.\nFlowerbomb Kush\n\nThe indica Flowerbomb Kush won\u2019t knock you out before celebrations are over. It\u2019s \u201cinvigorating cerebral effects\u201d balance out a floaty body high that will cruise you through the Chinese New Year\u2019s two weeks of festivities.\nPeaches and Cream\n\nAdd a little sweetness to your celebrations with the delicious hybrid Peaches and Cream. Possessing a \u201cheady euphoria,\u201d this strain will keep you going through\u00a0glowing nights full of fireworks.",

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: By crossing parent strains Hindu Kush and Mango, the tasty and potent strain known as Mango Kush was created. Its euphoric and relaxed high is similar to that of Hindu Kush, but its flavor is distinctively fruitier.\nGrow Techniques: Like Hindu Kush, this plant stays dense and bushy, resulting in increased yields in small spaces \u2013 especially when methods like SOG (sea of green) are used. Prune and trellis diligently to help keep the plants happy and healthy. You can easily fill a greenhouse or indoor space with clones and expect a heavy yield.\nFlowering Time: 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Mango Kush plants handle colder nighttime temperatures well but do poorly with heavy rains while flowering. It\u2019s best to keep Mango Kush between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Performs well indoors or out, as long as humidity is kept at bay.\nFeeding: Heavy feeding with CalMag will help keep this plant growing strong.",

            "text": "Right off the bat, the name caught my attention.   So I got a clone and tried it out.  This became one of my favorite plants to grow.  For starters, it only had 1 to 3 leaves on each branch as opposed to the typical 5 or 7.  It started growing the normal ones closer towards the end.  After much research, I was happy to find out that this would have no ill effect.  The buds were really thick and dense.  I was under the impression that this was more of an indica dominant hybrid.  If it is a total indica then you might be happy to know that it isn't a super heavyweight hitter or a 'de-motivator', but it has a killer buzz none the less.  It totally lived up to its rep for having an amazing smell and flavor.  Some of my friends swore it smelled and tasted like mango.  Others just thought it was really pungent and fruity.  Either way, it had the most unique smell I've ever experienced.",
