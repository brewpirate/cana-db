We were lying on the bed, awake, but couldn\u0027t move or talk, just giggled with each other and cuddled up, took us about an hour to get back up for our second bowl, then we fell asleep.. At 2pm.\n\n2nd best strain I\u0027ve ever smoked, hands down.\nPineapple Chunk, would be number 1 for me. But make no lie, this is a strong contender.\nMy only negative is that falling asleep so fast means you don\u0027t truly experience the high, this is why I would recommend Pineapple Chunk to anyone looking to get a high you can stay awake with that\u0027s similar in strength to this, it\u0027s a magical strain.\n\nPeace!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1631712,"username":"GreenGreenWA","text":"This Bushy, sturdy, resilliant Cannabis Plant is Legendary! I\u0027ve grown her outdoors in the Puget Sound Region and she loves the atmosphere. After the Dark Green Foliage is formed I cut the larger fan leaves to give the bottom some love too. This babe flowers at warp speed without much smell at all. It produces light green flower with the most trichome coverage i\u0027ve ever seen! After the full plant hang dry and subsequent meticulous trim and air tight 8-12 week cure the bloom booms with the sweetest,honey-pine, gas, syrupy aroma on earth. The smell alone will have your nostrils addicted to opening the jar just to get that exotic whiff. The indica effects tend to creep, while the the intitial effects are a sense of well being, enhanced senses and a true playfull or frisky kind of mood. Eventually, the relaxing full body buzz takes over all the limbs and puts the mind to sleep as well.
