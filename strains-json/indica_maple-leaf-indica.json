    "description": "<p>The Maple Leaf is a heroic strain of Indica with fat leaves, plump buds, and caked with crystals. Ml&#39;s lineage spans from the Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan and has survived through some turbulent times due to the invading former USSR in the 80s. The taste of the herb is sweet, somewhat citrusy, and smells of incense. The effect of this wonderful strain has been known to act as an aphrodisiac and gives off a very relaxing and sensational body buzz. Coupled with a loved one and some good music or a good movie, Maple Leaf Indica can help provide the right mood for romance...or if enjoyed too much, can bring on a deep sleep right in the middle of your plans.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n",

            "text": "One of the first legendary strains, in my opinion, I tried.\n\nI understand highly what it means when they say, \"if enjoyed too much, can bring on a deep sleep\".\nMe and my girl got a bag of this stuff, smelled amazing and was sticky like syrup.\nGot home, packed my favourite Yoda bong with a fat bowl, hit it, put a bowl for my girl and she hit it.\nThe high, I would like to note here, is  almost immediate, but once it starts, it continues to grow, you feel as though you're being enveloped by a cloud, don't smoke this if you can't handle such things, it can be distressful for some of a nervous disposition and 1st time smokers, this is for experienced tokers only.\n\nAnyway;\n2 minute later? We were lying on the bed, awake, but couldn't move or talk, just giggled with each other and cuddled up, took us about an hour to get back up for our second bowl, then we fell asleep.. At 2pm.\n\n2nd best strain I've ever smoked, hands down.\nPineapple Chunk, would be number 1 for me. But make no lie, this is a strong contender.\nMy only negative is that falling asleep so fast means you don't truly experience the high, this is why I would recommend Pineapple Chunk to anyone looking to get a high you can stay awake with that's similar in strength to this, it's a magical strain.\n\nPeace!",

            "text": "This Bushy, sturdy, resilliant Cannabis Plant is Legendary! I've grown her outdoors in the Puget Sound Region and she loves the atmosphere. After the Dark Green Foliage is formed I cut the larger fan leaves to give the bottom some love too. This babe flowers at warp speed without much smell at all. It produces light green flower with the most trichome coverage i've ever seen! After the full plant hang dry and subsequent meticulous trim and air tight 8-12 week cure the bloom booms with the sweetest,honey-pine, gas, syrupy aroma on earth. The smell alone will have your nostrils addicted to opening the jar just to get that exotic whiff. The indica effects tend to creep, while the the intitial effects are a sense of well being, enhanced senses and a true playfull or frisky kind of mood. Eventually, the relaxing full body buzz takes over all the limbs and puts the mind to sleep as well. This strain is Epic if you can get the real deal",
