It tastes of sweet citrus and a slightly kushy finish.\n\nthe sativa components hit immediately and gradually fade away to the tingle in your legs and the weight of your eyes. its a very relaxing strain for any time of day, however I prefer it in the evening. it's a superbly balanced hybrid. highly recommend it to anyone with stress or fatigue that needs a lift and a nap.
