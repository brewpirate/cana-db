Very calming but uplifting, this was my favorite thing to smoke after a shitty day at work.  Also loved it for the weekends, when I just wanted something that I could just puff here and there -  all day long.  I think this would be a great starting point for those afraid of a \"paranoia\" effect, or those who just want a night of self care. ( Self care being eating and sleeping and watching the shittiest documentaries on Netflix).",
