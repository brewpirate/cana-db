            "text": "Before the heat dies down and the sunsets start to shorten, it\u2019s time to make the most out of your summer. And just as ros\u00e9 is the perfect summer sipper, these 10 strains might as well have been bred expressly for summer fun with friends, whether out in the sun or under the stars.\nFrom sweet, citrusy sativas to sticky, sunset-hued hybrids, don\u2019t miss a single one of the following cannabis strains this season.\n\nSchrom | Sativa\n\u00a0\nAroma and flavor | Lemon-limey as a soda pop with extra squeezes of fresh-sliced citrus.\nExperience | Frequently tricky to hunt down, this 70% sativa delivers a breezy, buoyant, clear-headed elevation that\u2019s completely worth the search. An axiom frequently uttered around the Leafly office: \u201cSchrom is bomb.\u201d\nWhat you need it for | Chilling on the back patio with your favorite people.\nIntake | Bong, with an ice pinch.\nGolden Pineapple | Hybrid\n\u00a0\nAroma and flavor | Pineapple upside-down cake, fresh out of the oven, two inches from your nose. Somewhere nearby, a fruit basket overflows with papayas, ripe bananas, and mangoes.\nExperience | Gp is liquid sunshine, in the form of unadulterated happiness. You\u2019ll want to dance, hum, and hug someone.\nWhat you need it for | Your friend\u2019s backyard barbecue; pair it with a couple of teriyaki kebabs.\nIntake | Vaporizer that supports dry herb.\nRed-Headed Stranger | Sativa\n\u00a0\nAroma and flavor | Subtly spicy, tangy and herbal.\nExperience | Zippy, jazzy, energetic.\nWhat you need it for | Day hike motivation. The view from the top of that mountain is going to look better than ever.\nIntake | Pipe, tincture, or baked into an edible.\nSunset Sherbet | Hybrid\n\u00a0\nAroma and flavor | Sweetness underscores berry flavors on the inhale, then jumps out to steal the whole show on the exhale.\nExperience | GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) may be legendary, but Sunset Sherbet is its heir apparent. The hybrid builds on Gsc\u2019s all-star ancestry (grandparents: Cherry Pie, OG Kush, and Durban Poison), and weaves in a few indica-dominant characteristics all its own.\nWhat you need it for | A sandy beach at \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 sunset.\nIntake | Joint.\nIngrid | Indica\n\u00a0\nAroma and flavor | Sweet, skunky, earthy.\nExperience | Not all indicas are made for summer, but Ingrid is the free-wheeling hippie kid who got cool in college, came home over summer vacation, and knocked everyone\u2019s socks off. Side effects include a desire to snuggle up in a hammock and smile around at everyone and everything.\nWhat you need it for | Your next lakeside campout; break out a jar once you\u2019ve settled by the campfire for the evening.\nIntake | Pipe.\nTangie | Sativa\n\u00a0\nAroma and flavor | A tangerine dream come true. If aromas could drip citrus juice, this one would.\nExperience | Slow and shy to come on at first, Tg\u2019s high tends to hit as soon as you look the other way. It\u2019s a tingly rush of cool, creative energy, and you\u2019re going to want to get up and do stuff.\nWhat you need it for | You know how you\u2019ve been meaning to tackle that art project? Get on it.\nIntake | Concentrate; a li\u2019l dab\u2019ll do ya for the afternoon.\nSuper Silver Haze | Sativa\n\u00a0\nAroma and flavor | Earthy with hints of pine, like gardening in an evergreen forest.\nExperience | With numerous coveted first-place awards, Ss is one of the most decorated strains out there, and its energetic, euphoric high is among the most classic. It\u2019s a solid strain year-round, but its effects shine brightest from July through September.\nWhat you need it for | Your Labor Day backpacking trip.\nIntake | Pre-roll; no need to get fancy.\nJillybean | Hybrid\n\u00a0\nAroma and flavor | Orange candy meets a creamsicle in a fruity, delicious flavor-splosion.\nExperience | Chatty and cheerful for hours on end.\nWhat you need it for | Sitting on your front porch (preferably on a porch swing) with a glass of iced tea in one hand.\nIntake | Time-to-time tokes off your concentrate pen.\nMercury OG | Indica\n\u00a0\nAroma and flavor | Mer expresses a complex array of gorgeous floral characteristics; you\u2019ll have a hard time taking your nose out of the jar long enough to load a bowl.\nExperience | Get ready to relax, breathe easy, and relish a deeply pleasurable body high.\nWhat you need it for | Your family vacation.\nIntake | Bong or dab rig \u2013 go for a big hit.\nPurple Trainwreck | Hybrid\n\u00a0\nAroma and flavor | Think fragrant California wine grapes, freshly picked and about to be pressed.\nExperience | This bold yet balanced hybrid heightens everything you love about summer. There\u2019s also a good chance it\u2019ll bring on a bout of the giggles.\nWhat you need it for | An outdoor concert or afternoon of beach volleyball.\nIntake | Shatter, wax, or a classic joint.",

            "text": "This is my favorite day time \"I have nothing to do\" strain. It does keep you focused and to me a bit over critical of things you are working on, the trick is to start working on what ever you need to do BEFORE your first hit. This is a strong strain and it's VERY sticky. I smoke 90% of the time from a joint (I am a cigarette smoker as well) this strain does NOT burn well in a joint, the paper burns much faster and you end up wasting a lot. I will try this in a water bong instead. Love the taste, excellent for head and body high, great for all issues- eating/stomach problems, depression, body pain, and sleeping problems being the key ones. I tried painting on this, I was very focused and very slow, much slower than I would have been not on this, but because I slowed down I caught flaws much faster. Easy to smoke in a group and socialize as well. This is a must have on hand for me.",

            "text": "**I vaped this**\nRating it a 4 because it wasn't as groundbreaking as I thought it would be. It's a really nice OG though and I'm glad I got it! \n\nThis strain is the definition of \"chill af\"\nI felt an immediate wave of relaxation/pain relief when I first vaped this, followed by a calming pulse felt from the top of my head to the tip of my toes. And now the high is just a peaceful experience that will definitely lead to some shut eye. \nPerfect strain for a bath, this really stood out as useful for pain relief, insomnia, lack of appetite and anxiety. \n\nAlso...this is a munchie strain. Have snacks ON HAND.",
