    "description": "<p>Misty Kush&rsquo;s genetics include two of the most famous indica plants, <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow\">White Widow</a> and &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights\">Northern Lights</a>, along with another strong indica, Shiva. Given its origins, it may be surprising that this strain&rsquo;s effects tend to be more uplifting and mental than is usually expected from an indica. Misty Kush was created by breeders at Nirvana Seeds and quickly gained a following in its native Amsterdam. Misty are true indicas as plants; they&rsquo;re short in stature and will flower in 8 to 9 weeks. Indoor growing is best, but the plants&rsquo; strong stink may be a problem. This is one of those strains that truly has a &ldquo;sweet stink&rdquo; ranging from rotten fruit to old socks. Luckily, the taste is pure sugary goodness.</p>",

            "text": "I was very pleased with this strain. My dealer said it is og kush crossed with misty and hawaiin snow. The buds are dense sticky and smell very strongly of citrus. I have to keep this in a glass jar because the smell is very pungant. The high the strain provided me was very pleasant, happy, and uppy. This bud gave me a nice boost of energy and permi-grin for the entire time i was high. I smoked a 3g blunt between 3 people and it got us all increadably baked for about 3 hours. This bud seemed to burn slower than buds normally do. The blunt seemed to last for an extremely long period of time. This is a strain i would definately reccomend for seasoned smokers.",
