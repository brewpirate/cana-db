This strain prompted me to write my first review because it would be a dishonor to the islands of Hawaii for not promoting this incredible flower. After purchase i waited until the next morning to smoke it, i wanted to feel fresh. After breaking the seal, Moloka\u0027i\u0027s raw nature-like odor climbed up inside my nostrils and started f**king. I let the scent do its thing until it was finished and then loaded up a gravity bong. A couple coughs later and i was best friends with couch. GREAT ODIN\u0027S RAVEN was the come up satisfying! I wanted to sit down but also do everything i could think of all at once. Instead, I decided to build a much needed pineapple spice rack (you can find it on reddit). All in all, this is the perfect all-around strain to chill with friends, go to a sports game, bake muffins, or make sweet, sweet love to your woman.
