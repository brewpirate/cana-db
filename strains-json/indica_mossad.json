Having finally bought Fallout 4 for myself, I’m keeping an eye out for the G.O.A.T. hybrid which could only be a reference to the game’s Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test (…or maybe it stands for “Greatest Of All Time”). Check out the other strains recently added to Leafly below, and remember to leave reviews for any you’ve had a chance to try.\nWhich strains made it on your shopping list this weekend? Let’s hear about them in the comments section below!\n \n  1. G.O.A.T.\n\nCreated by Scapegoat Genetics and TSL Farms, G.O.A.T. is a hybrid strain that crosses Animal Pie and ACDC. Bursting with fragrant cherry aromas, G.O.A.T. is as flavorful as it is potent. With a 1:1 ratio of CBD:THC, this hybrid is preferred by patients treating pain, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. \n\n \n  2. Mossad\n\nMossad is an indica-dominant strain bred by Terraform Genetics, who crossed a Conspiracy Kush male with the Kosher Kush female. This San Fernando Valley strain may express one of two sets of characteristics depending on the phenotype. The first (dubbed Mossad OG) takes after its OG heritage, with frosty and dense buds that exhibit a unique calyx structure. Its aroma is a sweet and herbal mix of rose and sage, and its effects will leave you feeling mellow and relaxed following a slightly energetic cerebral buzz. The second phenotype (referred to as Mossad Kush) inherits more characteristics from Conspiracy Kush, boasting a hashy, earthy aroma accented by sour lemons.\n\n \n  3. Northern Lights #5 x Haze\n\nA sativa from Sensi Seeds, Northern Lights #5 x Haze is a vigorous strain bred to improve upon Haze’s flowering time and bud structure. With zesty flavors of pungent spice, this 70% sativa delivers an invigorating cerebral buzz that seems to boost sensory awareness. Though the indica in her shines through in density and growth stature, this strain carefully preserves an uplifting high that’s perfect for daytime use.\n\n \n  4. Jamba Juice\n\nJamba Juice is a unique clone-only offering from Golden State Genetics. This pungent hybrid packs tantalizing exotic fruit aromas, offering sweet and candy flavors from start to finish.\n\n \n  5. Chronic Thunder\n\nChronic Thunder is an indica strain bred by Barney’s Farm that offers full-body effects alongside a funky diesel and spicy pepper aroma. Save this heavy-hitter for a day in which you find your to-do list blank, because this indica will have you stuck in a comfortable place for a while. With moderate levels of CBD, Chronic Thunder is preferred for resolving insomnia, pain, and upset stomachs.\n\n \n  6. Jungle Juice\n\n\nBred by Golden State Genetics, Jungle Juice is a hybrid strain that crosses Animal Cookies and their in-house Tangie male. Balancing sweet and sour citrus flavors, this strain offers a flavorful release from stress, sleeplessness, and pain.\n\n \n  7. Black Lime Special Reserve\n\n\nFrom Aficionado Seeds comes Black Lime Special Reserve, an indica strain that descends from Woodman Canyon Oil Can, Lime Afghani, Northern Lights, Purple Kush, and Chemdawg Special Reserve. Flavors of pine, lemon, and black pepper are ushered in alongside uplifting euphoria, leaving you feeling tingly and relaxed.\n\n \nBrowse through other new strains that were added recently to the Leafly Explorer or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12002126/new-strains-alert-goat-chronic-thunder-jamba-juice-and-more.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-goat-chronic-thunder-jamba-juice-and-more"}],"reviewCount":4,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":5},{"name":"Lemon","score":5},{"name":"Earthy","score":5}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":5},{"name":"Focused","score":5},{"name":"Relaxed","score":5}],"symptoms":[],"conditions":[],"negatives":[{"name":"Headache","score":5},{"name":"Paranoid","score":5},{"name":"Anxious","score":5}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mossad_100x100_e1ef.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/472689/b/mossad__primary_c488.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mossad_100x100_9f04.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/458860/b/mossad__primary_c904.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/mossad","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3.75/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Conspiracy Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"conspiracy-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/conspiracy-kush","symbol":"Csp","applink":"leafly://strain/conspiracy-kush"},{"name":"Kosher Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"kosher-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/kosher-kush","symbol":"Kos","applink":"leafly://strain/kosher-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Having finally bought Fallout 4 for myself, I’m keeping an eye out for the G.O.A.T. hybrid which could only be a reference to the game’s Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test (…or maybe it stands for “Greatest Of All Time”). Check out the other strains recently added to Leafly below, and remember to leave reviews for any you’ve had a chance to try.\nWhich strains made it on your shopping list this weekend? Let’s hear about them in the comments section below!\n \n  1. G.O.A.T.\n\nCreated by Scapegoat Genetics and TSL Farms, G.O.A.T. is a hybrid strain that crosses Animal Pie and ACDC. Bursting with fragrant cherry aromas, G.O.A.T. is as flavorful as it is potent. With a 1:1 ratio of CBD:THC, this hybrid is preferred by patients treating pain, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. \n\n \n  2. Mossad\n\nMossad is an indica-dominant strain bred by Terraform Genetics, who crossed a Conspiracy Kush male with the Kosher Kush female. This San Fernando Valley strain may express one of two sets of characteristics depending on the phenotype. The first (dubbed Mossad OG) takes after its OG heritage, with frosty and dense buds that exhibit a unique calyx structure. Its aroma is a sweet and herbal mix of rose and sage, and its effects will leave you feeling mellow and relaxed following a slightly energetic cerebral buzz. The second phenotype (referred to as Mossad Kush) inherits more characteristics from Conspiracy Kush, boasting a hashy, earthy aroma accented by sour lemons.\n\n \n  3. Northern Lights #5 x Haze\n\nA sativa from Sensi Seeds, Northern Lights #5 x Haze is a vigorous strain bred to improve upon Haze’s flowering time and bud structure. With zesty flavors of pungent spice, this 70% sativa delivers an invigorating cerebral buzz that seems to boost sensory awareness. Though the indica in her shines through in density and growth stature, this strain carefully preserves an uplifting high that’s perfect for daytime use.\n\n \n  4. Jamba Juice\n\nJamba Juice is a unique clone-only offering from Golden State Genetics. This pungent hybrid packs tantalizing exotic fruit aromas, offering sweet and candy flavors from start to finish.\n\n \n  5. Chronic Thunder\n\nChronic Thunder is an indica strain bred by Barney’s Farm that offers full-body effects alongside a funky diesel and spicy pepper aroma. Save this heavy-hitter for a day in which you find your to-do list blank, because this indica will have you stuck in a comfortable place for a while. With moderate levels of CBD, Chronic Thunder is preferred for resolving insomnia, pain, and upset stomachs.\n\n \n  6. Jungle Juice\n\n\nBred by Golden State Genetics, Jungle Juice is a hybrid strain that crosses Animal Cookies and their in-house Tangie male. Balancing sweet and sour citrus flavors, this strain offers a flavorful release from stress, sleeplessness, and pain.\n\n \n  7. Black Lime Special Reserve\n\n\nFrom Aficionado Seeds comes Black Lime Special Reserve, an indica strain that descends from Woodman Canyon Oil Can, Lime Afghani, Northern Lights, Purple Kush, and Chemdawg Special Reserve. Flavors of pine, lemon, and black pepper are ushered in alongside uplifting euphoria, leaving you feeling tingly and relaxed.\n\n \nBrowse through other new strains that were added recently to the Leafly Explorer or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12002126/new-strains-alert-goat-chronic-thunder-jamba-juice-and-more.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-goat-chronic-thunder-jamba-juice-and-more"}],"reviewCount":4,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":5},{"name":"Lemon","score":5},{"name":"Earthy","score":5}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":5},{"name":"Focused","score":5},{"name":"Relaxed","score":5}],"symptoms":[],"conditions":[],"negatives":[{"name":"Headache","score":5},{"name":"Paranoid","score":5},{"name":"Anxious","score":5}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mossad_100x100_e1ef.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/472689/b/mossad__primary_c488.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mossad_100x100_9f04.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/458860/b/mossad__primary_c904.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/mossad","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3.75/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Conspiracy Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"conspiracy-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/conspiracy-kush","symbol":"Csp","applink":"leafly://strain/conspiracy-kush"},{"name":"Kosher Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"kosher-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/kosher-kush","symbol":"Kos","applink":"leafly://strain/kosher-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
