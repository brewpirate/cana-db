            "text": "Rhythm and Blues is a rich genre with roots planted firmly in the black American community. It is a genre synonymous with emotion\u2014music that feeds the soul and tells stories of pain and love. Born in the 1940s, R&B has evolved over the decades to mean different things during different times while covering other genres such as gospel, funk, hip hop, and soul.\n\nDiverse as it is, there is a rich plethora of R&B to explore and appreciate. While the genre may encompass many elements, R&B will always be known for radiating feeling and heart. As R&B artist Kenny \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds says, \u201cR&B is the one thing that has influenced every kind of music.\u201d Pack a bowl and turn up these five powerful R&B albums to electrify your next smoke session.\nWoman by Jill Scott\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Ultraviolet OG\nJill Scott\u2019s album\u00a0Woman\u00a0marks her fifth and latest release. The album showcases Scott\u2019s powerful and hypnotic voice against irresistibly catchy beats.

Erykah Badu\u2019s voice, at once both strong and soothing, is a delight to luxuriate in, and it takes center stage against a backdrop of steady and well-rounded instrumentation. Released in 2010, the album encompasses Badu\u2019s neo-soul flavors, with elements of funk, hip hop, and electronic mixed in. All in all, it is a truly heartfelt album, with a vibe that will have you in your feels from the first to the last note.\nLet Love Rule by Ledisi\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Black Diamond\nLedisi\u2019s uplifting voice is captivating on her 2017 album, Let Love Rule. Ledisi takes the listener on a journey through various sounds and themes, with influences of hip hop and soul woven throughout. Let Love Rule is a work of poignancy, incorporating important social issues like the Black Lives Matter movement. Her song \u201cShot Down\u201d addresses police brutality against black Americans with lyrics like \u201cShot down on display in the middle of the story / She was shot down in the park in the middle of the day,\u201d and \u201cThe System says we matter, but the black lives only / Matter certain days.\u201d Ledisi combines these raw, real lyrics with her powerful, soulful voice, and exquisite instrumentals make it all sound effortless\u2014though it is anything but.\n\nFunk This by Chaka Khan\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Mother of Berries\nLegendary \u201cQueen of Funk\u201d singer/songwriter and talented drummer Chaka Khan has been producing music for five decades, incorporating funk, jazz, and soul influences. Funk This, released in 2007, is Khan\u2019s most modern album that exemplifies her unique sound and style. The album features funky R&B beats, full instrumentation, and Khan\u2019s signature vocals ripe with feeling and presence. From high-energy tracks such as \u201cDisrespectful\u201d to soulful ballads such as \u201cAngel,\u201d Funk This is an immersive album that demonstrates why Khan is called Queen.\nThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill by Ms. Lauryn Hill\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Punky Lion\nLauryn Hill\u2019s first solo album, released in 1998, gained wide spread acclaim and went on to break records. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is a hard-hitting and expertly assembled album featuring Lauryn Hill\u2019s unique mix of beauty and boldness. With elements of rap, reggae, hip hop, and soul, Hill fluctuates effortlessly between commanding lyrical composition and light, effervescent singing\u2014both of which pull the listener in and captivate.

Strong couchlock with creative ideas, a euphoric sense, and a vibrant body high that pinpoints in joints. With the slightest wiff, you will be mezmerized. Then you will notice it's (hopefully) distinct purple faded,  slightly dense pine cone nuggets. One toke later your just about blown away by a hit of dark, fruity smooth but thick smoke, reminiscent of a grape and blue razz berry jolly rancher mixed. ",
