Mt. Cook\n\nNamed after the highest peak in New Zealand, Mt. Cook by Kiwiseeds is a former Cannabis Cup champion.

Known to be powerful and sedative, this is a great strain to relax and catch some sleep with.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Island Maui Haze\n\nIsland Maui Haze is a 75/25 sativa-dominant strain with effects that can creep up on you. These dense, forest green buds may not initially attract you based on its strong, ammonia smell; however, this crystal-covered strain is praised for its uplifting, energetic effects that can relieve pain and other symptoms without bringing you down into a lazy state.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Island Maui Haze\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Leda Uno\n\nA Cannabis Cup finalist in the sativa category, Leda Uno will undoubtedly raise your spirits. The team at KC Brains took its KC 33 crossed with a Brazilian female landrace and crossed it once more with its KC 606 and Leda hybrid. The result is a smooth lemony hybrid with beautiful chunky, light green buds. Best when grown in soil, this plant can shoot to 10 feet outdoors and produces considerable yields.\n\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",

            "text": "One of my favorite strains since 2010 or so.   When my friend grew it,it tasted like watermelon. While the bean I cracked has a more citrus like flavor, I've narrowed the flavor down to Sierra Mist soda :).  \nThe effects were the same from both plants; a warm powerful high, I feel in a Zen like state when I smoke it and my body feels like I've got a warm-fluffy blanket wrapped around it.  Has been great for pain! My planters F...my feet hurt less!  Hell, everything hurts less.\nI like growing this plant too, and I'm not a great grower yet. No matter how bad my other plants may do, this one seems to be very tolerant of basic mistakes.  It yields better than average, branches and vegs well, doesn't need much help but I always trellis.  FIM works well with her, clones easy.\nMy first review! Pics will show buds in flower and next to a 420 scope.",
