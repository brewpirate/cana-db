When my friend grew it,it tasted like watermelon. While the bean I cracked has a more citrus like flavor, I\u0027ve narrowed the flavor down to Sierra Mist soda :).  \nThe effects were the same from both plants; a warm powerful high, I feel in a Zen like state when I smoke it and my body feels like I\u0027ve got a warm-fluffy blanket wrapped around it.  Has been great for pain! My planters F...my feet hurt less!  Hell, everything hurts less.\nI like growing this plant too, and I\u0027m not a great grower yet. No matter how bad my other plants may do, this one seems to be very tolerant of basic mistakes.  It yields better than average, branches and vegs well, doesn\u0027t need much help but I always trellis.  FIM works well with her, clones easy.\nMy first review!
