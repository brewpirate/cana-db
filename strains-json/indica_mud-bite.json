The strain IS REAL, folks, it does exist!! Currently single digit number of growers of original strain left. It held its own in the 70's against Columbian Gold, Panama Red, THE original Thai-Stick, etc...  Rare to find, availability very limited so if one is lucky enough to be able to find a reliable, original strain supplier - do not disrespect the source! These guys are dead serious about maintaining the original 70's strain, years of skill and they love their craft! It all shows in the final product as it's truly a one-of-a-kind, physically \"chilling\", smooth hitting, power punching high! Do not make big plans after smoking this unless it involves the couch or kicking back... Movies and munchies go good with this!",
