The first clone I took ended up hermaphroditing on me because I had a bad light leak in my tent for a few days that allowed sunlight to come in and throw this plant off, so beware of stress with this plant to prevent hermaphrodite tendencies, otherwise this plant is rock solid genetically speaking.  This plant doesn\u0027t need very long in the vegg stage in you are trying to keep your plants in the  2-3 feet range.  It will stretch 2-3x the first 2 weeks of flowering, so I advise topping early on in vegg to try and bush it out.  2 main phenotypes: one with buds that form in a totem pole style with monster buds measuring 8-10\" long and the other phenotype with here and there rock style buds the size of golf balls.  Both pheno\u0027s produce about the same yield.

This plant doesn\u0027t need very long in the vegg stage in you are trying to keep your plants in the  2-3 feet range.
