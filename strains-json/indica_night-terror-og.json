Took about 0.1g and vaped it through my SSV, the flavors were outstanding, delicious grape and berry with a light piney finish. Took a little while to set in but the relaxation was exceptional and I was quite sedate, shedding the day\u0027s earlier anxiety. I fell asleep about 30 minutes after vaping and woke up about an hour and half later, feeling very calm and composed. Sauntered off to bed and slept wonderfully. Slight grogginess this morning but overall this is easily a 5 star strain for me!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"},{"id":1631635,"username":"thiccnkushy","text":"I went through the loss of a child recently and I never thought I\u0027d find anything to help me cope with it, but this strain seriously does the trick.

We\u0027ve highlighted five that made the cut, but you can browse many other newly added varieties in the Explorer.\nLeave a review if you\u0027ve already had a chance to indulge in one of these newcomers!\n   1. Lucid Dream\nCharacteristics of Lucid Dream:\n\nLucid Dream is a dynamic blend of Amnesia Haze and Blue Dream. This sativa-dominant hybrid provides a stimulating mix of uplifting Haze effects with the sweet blueberry notes of Blue Dream. Lucid Dream\u0027s energetic, uplifting buzz makes it a great daytime choice for patients treating migraines, nausea, and stress.\n\n   2. Night Terror OG\nCharacteristics of Night Terror OG:\n\nNight Terror OG is what you get when you combine Blue Dream with Rare Darkness #1 genetics. This cleverly named hybrid sways heavily toward the indica side of the spectrum, inducing relaxing effects that sink deeper in the body over time. You may find your eyelids feeling heavy before long, but don’t let a name like Night Terror OG fool you: a good night’s sleep is on its way. This 70% indica isn’t necessarily a day-ender, as the OG Kush in Rare Darkness genes provides a heady, invigorating buzz that deteriorates stress at the end of a long day. These effects are ushered in by flavors of blueberry and fruit with subtle notes of lemon, pine, and diesel.\n\n   3. Sonoma Coma\nCharacteristics of Sonoma Coma:\n\nSonoma Coma sprouted in Sonoma County, California and presents itself with tight, electric green buds which produce a thick coat of trichomes that sparkle in the sunlight. Contrary to what the name implies, Sonoma Coma is actually an energetic, uplifting sativa. The genetics remain a closely guarded recipe but are impressive enough to claim the prize for 1st place Sativa at the 2012 High Times Medical Cannabis Cup in Los Angeles. A complex mixture of sweet tropical fruits and spiced, woody undertones combine to give Sonoma Coma its distinct aroma. The flavor maintains the aroma’s complex characteristics but provides a smooth mellow finish. True to its sativa heritage, Sonoma Coma produces an energetic invasion of heady effects that produce bursts of creativity and euphoria. This strain is also known to induce a case of the munchies, so it makes a great remedy to a diminished appetite.\n\n   4. Soul Assassin OG\nCharacteristics of Soul Assassin OG:\n\nSoul Assassin OG is an OG Kush variety bred by the Soul Assassins Crew, a collective of musicians and artists affiliated with the hip hop group Cypress Hill. While the genetics remain unclassified, there have been rumblings through the underground that Lemon Thai is the mistress responsible for influencing OG Kush into its Soul Assassin OG offspring. It is an indica-dominant hybrid that produces smooth, expansive smoke with and aroma of pungent diesel and citrus fumes. Soul Assassin OG evokes sleepy, knockout indica effects that help silence any pain, stress, or tension from a long a day.\n\n   5. Americano\nCharacteristics of Americano:\n\nAmericano is a Canadian strain released by Enterprise Seeds. It is a Northern Lights/Skunk hybrid that is named for the American consumers it was designed to attract. When tourists, notably Americans, came to Vancouver looking to purchase bulk cannabis, they wanted their buds to have “bag appeal” – or stunning visual characteristics that made it easy to sell. Americano is known for its heavy coat of trichomes and its thick dense colas. The flavors and aromas of Americano stay true to its Skunk lineage and produce a sweet, piney musk. The effects are exactly what you would expect from an indica-driven hybrid: fast-acting, relaxing, and sleepy. Americano is a solid answer to symptoms of insomnia, headaches, and chronic pain.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002226/new-strains-alert-lucid-dream-night-terror-og-sonoma-coma-soul-as.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-lucid-dream-night-terror-og-sonoma-coma-soul-as"}],"reviewCount":84,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":26.331168831168831},{"name":"Earthy","score":24.231601731601735},{"name":"Berry","score":21.038961038961041},{"name":"Pungent","score":16.872294372294373},{"name":"Grape","score":15.086580086580087}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":108.8095238095238},{"name":"Sleepy","score":98.961038961038952},{"name":"Happy","score":79.177489177489178},{"name":"Hungry","score":51.103896103896105},{"name":"Uplifted","score":31.861471861471863}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":78.733766233766232},{"name":"Insomnia","score":75.281385281385283},{"name":"Pain","score":57.489177489177493},{"name":"Depression","score":52.132034632034632},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":36.287878787878789}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":48.290043290043293},{"name":"PTSD","score":35.8008658008658},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":28.279220779220779},{"name":"Arthritis","score":18.279220779220779},{"name":"Migraines","score":17.629870129870131}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":54.502164502164504},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":15.465367965367966},{"name":"Dizzy","score":2.9220779220779223},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.75757575757575757},{"name":"Headache","score":0.37878787878787878}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/night-terror-og_100x100_1f4e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/651699/b/night-terror-og__primary_826e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/night-terror-og_100x100_d736.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522934/b/night-terror-og__primary_9e90.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/night-terror-og_100x100_0fe4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/458012/b/night-terror-og__primary_799a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/night-terror-og_100x100_06c7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/450828/b/night-terror-og__primary_f4eb.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/night-terror-og_100x100_e1c7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/407019/b/night-terror-og__primary_0503.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/night-terror-og_100x100_bdf6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/401836/b/night-terror-og__primary_ab50.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":13,"popularCities":["Bay City, MI","Boston, MA","Brockton, MA","Las Vegas, NV","Point Arena, CA","Santa Ana, CA","Sparks, NV"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/night-terror-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.60714285714286/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Blue Dream","subtitle":null,"slug":"blue-dream","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-dream","symbol":"Bd","applink":"leafly://strain/blue-dream"},{"name":"Rare Darkness","subtitle":null,"slug":"rare-darkness","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/rare-darkness","symbol":"Rar","applink":"leafly://strain/rare-darkness"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":65,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
