The buds themselves glisten like diamonds, and are light and fluffy; Congratulations to Suspended for growing some damn nice bud. Very strong effects that take over mind and body, but not turbulent. Slightly face-melty, definitely some effects of Trainwreck, a couch-lock hard Indica for sure. Definitely more Indica than Sativa, feels like Trainwreck if it were crossed with GD Purp or similar. Not super long lasting, but a very, very strong high with great effects. A+.\n\nOn another note, this vaporizes VERY well. I\u0027ve thought that vaping didn\u0027t get me as high as smoking, but this one feels like the first hit I ever took!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"},{"id":1632881,"username":"skullerymaid","text":"Solid indica... very clear headed, which can sometimes make sleep more difficult for some people.

Velvet Bud\n\nLike the name suggests, Velvet Bud will produce a smoke that is smooth like velvet.

L\u0027Eagle Eagle\n\nThe L\u0027Eagle Eagle hybrid is a blend of Candy Haze and Skunk #6 genetics offered at L\u0027Eagle Services in Denver, Colorado.

Blue Treat\n\nJordan of the Islands matched two of the sweetest tasting flowers to make this candy of an strain. Using Blueberry and Dutch Treat genetics, Blue Treat was born. This short plant takes after its strong indica lineage, producing sticky resinous buds that can soothe your pain and relieve your stress. The dark green buds are covered in trichomes and give off a sweet berry aroma.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Blue Treat\n \n   7.
