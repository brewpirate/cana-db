Burned smooth and clean, and vape was even smoother. Sweet berry flavor with uplifting and calming effect. Worked great for stress and dulled some chronic back pain (L4S5, for the record), but keep a drink within reach and make no plans to go out and engage the public in conversation. Also, very good for last burn of the night, or last burn before gaming.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1607918,"username":"cmarcosn","text":"Helps you sleep","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":8,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":111.11111111111111},{"name":"Lavender","score":100},{"name":"Rose","score":100},{"name":"Woody","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":5.5555555555555554}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":116.66666666666666},{"name":"Focused","score":113.88888888888889},{"name":"Sleepy","score":111.11111111111111},{"name":"Happy","score":105.55555555555556},{"name":"Uplifted","score":8.3333333333333321}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Insomnia","score":111.11111111111111},{"name":"Depression","score":105.55555555555556},{"name":"Fatigue","score":105.55555555555556},{"name":"Stress","score":105.55555555555556},{"name":"Seizures","score":100}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":105.55555555555556},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"PTSD","score":2.7777777777777777}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":105.55555555555556},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":5.5555555555555554},{"name":"Dizzy","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"Headache","score":2.7777777777777777}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/north-american-indica_100x100_7f7a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/556972/b/north-american-indica__primary_f61d.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Las Vegas, NV","Denver, CO","Santa Fe, NM"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/north-american","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.75/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
