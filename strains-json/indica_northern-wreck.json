            "text": "Leafly just updated its database with some new strains! Allow us to introduce you to Margaret Cho-G (soon we'll all have our own OG strain), Flaming Cookies, Fruit Punch, Pie Face OG, Northern Wreck, Alpha Cow, and Hurkle. Find out if these new strains are available near you by checking the links below, and leave a strain review once you've had a chance to try any of them!\n\u00a0\n 1. Margaret Cho-G\n\nComedian Margaret Cho makes her move into the cannabis game with Margaret Cho-G, a cut of the famous OG Kush available in Bay Area, California. Sweet lemon, woody pine, and sour diesel flavors lead you into Margaret Cho-G\u2019s powerfully tranquilizing effects that any OG Kush enthusiast will appreciate. Pairing this strain with some stand-up is a surefire recipe for laughing fits, giving this hybrid even more reason to be dubbed \u201cMargaret Cho-G.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n 2. Flaming Cookies\n\nGSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) and Fire OG combine to create Flaming Cookies, a potent indica strain that delivers a thick fog of cerebral euphoria. Woody, earthy, and diesel flavors give away this strain\u2019s OG lineage, with an added hint of minty eucalyptus. Scorching orange hairs burst from this indica\u2019s dark buds, giving the flowers themselves an almost fire-like appearance.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Flaming Cookies\n\u00a0\n 3. Fruit Punch\n\nFruit Punch is a mostly sativa strain from Heavyweight Seeds, who bred this flavor powerhouse from Skunk, Haze, and Northern Lights genetics. Named for its swift hit of sweet fruity and tropical flavors, this sativa has something to offer in both taste and effect. Fruit Punch charges the mind with creative and social energy, so keep this strain in your stash jar for active days spent with friends or personal hobbies.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Fruit Punch\n\u00a0\n 4. Pie Face OG\n\nPie Face OG is what you get when you cross Cherry Pie with Face Off OG, a creation from Archive Seed Bank. This 60/40 indica-dominant strain carries a sweet cherry and earthy hash flavor, taking after both sides of the family. Though potently euphoric, Pie Face OG\u2019s effects leave enough mental clarity for you to stay functional and engaged throughout the day\u2019s tasks. This hybrid is ideal for social afternoons, unwinding after a stressful day, or kick-starting the appetite.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Pie Face OG\n\u00a0\n 5. Northern Wreck\n\nNorthern Wreck is an indica-dominant strain that combines the dizzying strength of Northern Lights with the complex cerebral sensations of Trainwreck. Get to a comfortable place, because Northern Wreck will leave you melting under the force of its euphoria. With its heavy yields and fast flowering cycle, Northern Wreck is a blessing to commercial growers looking to harvest a lot of product quickly.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Northern Wreck\n\u00a0\n 6. Alpha Cow\n\nAlpha Cow is a sativa strain that brings together genetics from Alpha Blue and Purple Cow. Its aroma is a distinctive mix of overripe blueberries and sweet toffee, while the exhale accentuates its smooth berry flavors. Some sativas tend to bring on racing thoughts, but this strain provides a calming buzz with mellow cerebral sensations that keep you feeling uplifted and positive.\n\nAlpha Cow is currently available at The Farm in Boulder, CO\n\u00a0\n 7. Hurkle\n\nBred by TGA Genetics, Hurkle is a hybrid cross between the high-CBD sativa Harlequin and a Querkle indica. Most Hurkle phenotypes will hover around a 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD, but some variation should be expected. Flavors of grape, coffee, and chocolate overwhelm the palate in a flavorful introduction to Hurkle\u2019s calming effects. CBD and THC team up to crush pain, stress, and anxiety, leaving you feeling relaxed in both mind and body.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Hurkle\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",
