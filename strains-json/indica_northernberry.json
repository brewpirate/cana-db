OK sorry for caps but I\u0027m serious, northern berry aka \"Big Blue\" is an amazing Indica with amazing Sativa cerebral effects to complement the heavy indica. This strain smells and reeks of Blueberry more than any other Blueberry strain I\u0027ve tried I truly can\u0027t believe the taste off this stuff it\u0027s incredible. This stuff is amazing for pain relief, anxiety \u0026 depression, you will definitely get \"glued\" but it\u0027s so worth it. Definitely a MUST TRY for newbies \u0026 vets! Hands down a 5 star rating!

Didn\u0027t improve depression really for me but did ease my anxiety. Hunger creeps up on you, then bam - tired dry eyes ready to sleep, and a lil dizziness and slight headache too. Even though I was very chill, I got majorly engrossed in researching holiday hotel packages and looking at the pictures lol so still focused creatively I guess. Not as good as it\u0027s hyped up to be for me but still solid, and not for the faint hearted.
