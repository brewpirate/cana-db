This strain smells and reeks of Blueberry more than any other Blueberry strain I've tried I truly can't believe the taste off this stuff it's incredible. This stuff is amazing for pain relief, anxiety & depression, you will definitely get \"glued\" but it's so worth it. Definitely a MUST TRY for newbies & vets! Hands down a 5 star rating! ",

Hunger creeps up on you, then bam - tired dry eyes ready to sleep, and a lil dizziness and slight headache too. Even though I was very chill, I got majorly engrossed in researching holiday hotel packages and looking at the pictures lol so still focused creatively I guess. Not as good as it's hyped up to be for me but still solid, and not for the faint hearted. B+\n\nAND IT STINKS :)",
