            "text": "Every year we like to look back and recognize the rising stars of the cannabis world. Last year, GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4), Critical Kush, Candyland, and ACDC were among the fastest trending\u00a0strains according to Leafly user strain reviews, but which strains stood out from the crowd this year?\nTo eliminate outliers that might skew the results, we restricted our search to the top 200 ranking strains of 2016. These strains tend to be more available nationwide, and we hope you\u2019re able to find them in your area!\nBudtenders and inventory managers \u2013 are these trending strains on your menu? If not, consider keeping an eye out for them. Because in 2016, they were flying off the shelves fast.\n\n#10.\u00a0Blue Cookies\n\nWe all know that customers swarm around anything containing the word \u201cCookies,\u201d thanks to the Girl Scout Cookie hype. But what makes Blue Cookies stand out from the many, many other Cookie crosses? The addition of Blueberry indica genetics, of course.\n#9.\u00a0Birthday Cake Kush\n\nAnother decadent GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) cross, Birthday Cake Kush also pulls in genetics from Cherry Pie to achieve a dessert-like taste that\u2019s not altogether unlike cake itself. It may not be your birthday, but the luxurious and relaxing qualities of this potent hybrid are certainly something to celebrate.\n#8.\u00a0Sour Tangie\n\nThe citrus-loaded sativa strain Tangie can\u2019t possibly be improved. Or can it? DNA Genetics has done it again, spinning their Tangie masterpiece with the help of East Coast Sour Diesel\u00a0genetics. Sour Tangie improves the fuel-like taste of Sour Diesel without compromising Sour D\u2019s high-flying creative effects, making this sativa a must-have for flavor enthusiasts and artists alike.\n#7.\u00a0Purple Candy\n\nPurple Candy blossomed in British Columbia, Canada. Believed to be a cross between BC Sweet Tooth and Mendocino Purps, it\u2019s\u00a0as sticky and sweet as grape hard candy. But you won\u2019t feel a sugar rush with this indica; instead, expect the heavy-hitter to prime you for bedtime or a solid nap.\n#6.\u00a0Quantum Kush\n\nA good sativa can lend a positive spark to an otherwise dreary day of chores, so it\u2019s no wonder that Quantum Kush tipped the charts in 2016 as one of the fastest\u00a0trending\u00a0sativa strains. While some sativas bring on the buzz with a bit too much gusto, resulting in anxiety and paranoia, Quantum Kush manages to deliver creative, talkative, giggly qualities without what we like to call \u201cThe Fear.\u201d\n#5.\u00a0God\u2019s Green Crack\n\nWho knew the not-so holy union of God Bud and Green Crack would result in something so heavenly? God Bud is known for producing mammoth yields of gargantuan buds, but the effects are a little heavy-handed for some. That\u2019s why Jordan of the Islands crossbred God Bud with Green Crack, the high-flying sativa strain that focuses all of its effort on elevating the mind to a place where laughing fits are inevitable.\n#4.\u00a0Gelato\n\nA new generation of GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) has arrived, and its name is Gelato. From the same breeders that delivered fan favorites Sunset Sherbet and GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), Cookie Fam Genetics from Bay Area, California isn\u2019t finished with their royal line quite yet. Gelato, a descendent of Sunset Sherbet and Thin Mint GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), blooms in bright colors that are almost as inviting as its tantalizing dessert-like aroma.\n#3.\u00a0Grape Stomper\n\nGrape Stomper isn\u2019t a new strain, but a jump in Leafly reviews will show that not all good things are sparkly and new. Strong genetics inherited from Purple Elephant and Chemdawg Sour Diesel equip this strain with the full package: flavor, potency, and consistency. Relaxing without encumbering social skills, the balanced Grape Stomper is an excellent choice for so many different activities. No wonder its popularity isn\u2019t waning.\n#2.\u00a0Nuken\n\nNuken is also an older strain making a comeback. Originally found in Canada, it\u2019s\u00a0since proliferated throughout the Pacific Northwest to states like Washington and Oregon. Herbal and sweet in flavor, Nuken cradles you in a blanket of dreamy euphoria where your thoughts can float upward to bliss.\n#1.\u00a0Superglue\n\nLast year, the top trending strain was GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4). This year it\u2019s Superglue, which surprisingly bears no family ties to last year\u2019s champ. A cross between Northern Lights and Afghani, Superglue develops a thick coat of sticky resin that will quite literally glue your fingers together. Though its parentage may lead you to believe Superglue will be a knockout, this strain is bred to deliver more light-footed effects. In fact, Leafly users have described this strain as focusing and creative while simultaneously relaxing the body.\n\nWhat was your favorite strain of 2016? We want to hear from you! Leave your most memorable cannabis varieties in the strain section below.",

            "text": "Since the presidential nominations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, record numbers of people have been searching Google for \u201cHow to Move to Canada.\u201d The grass may be greener on the other side, whether we\u2019re talking about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or Canada-grown bud. So for those of you seeking democracy to the North, allow us to point you to a few memorable cannabis varieties with Canadian roots for you to enjoy after your grand escape.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0OG Shark\nA strain so potent, it\u2019ll make you forget all the woes you left back home. OG Shark is a powerful hybrid strain that knocks out stress, depression, headaches, and many other symptoms the 2016 election may have left you with. True to its OG roots, this hybrid reeks of lemony fuel with hints of forest pine that\u2019ll keep you coming back to the bowl for more.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Nuken\nNuken is an indica strain that strikes a balance between relaxation and invigoration, giving your body escape from pain and tension while the mind soars with upbeat euphoria. Weaving together genetics from the widely cherished parent strains Shishkaberry and God Bud, Nuken was destined for success. Herbal, woody aromas come together to create an organic flavor profile that brings the mind a little closer to nature and the peace it provides. We know you need it.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Black Tuna\nThis BC native mixes old school indica genetics from Herijuana and the Jamaican sativa Lamb\u2019s Bread to build a unique hybrid named for its original packaging: sealed tuna cans. The days of Black Tuna\u2019s secretive marketing may be no more, but Black Tuna lives on, offering powerfully sedating effects that can help you hibernate until the 2020 election.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Island Sweet Skunk\nIsland Sweet Skunk is a sativa strain from Vancouver Island that offers sweet-tasting freedom from stress and anxiety alongside its creative effects. Sour skunky notes intermix with tropical orange and grapefruit to create an intricate composition of flavors that no doubt helped bring this strain fame and prosperity far beyond the borders in which it first grew.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Chemo\nAs the story goes, Chemo was developed in Canada in the early 1970s at the University of British Columbia to treat the side effects of chemotherapy. Maintained by Canadian cannabis breeders Jordan of the Isles, Chemo remains an indica staple, showing itself off with a woody, earthy aroma. Its effects sink deep in the body, relaxing muscles while simultaneously backhanding nausea, insomnia, and appetite loss.",
