            "text": "If you don\u2019t get high before attending a sporting event, then you\u2019re doing it all wrong. I mean, sure, you can have a good time while being sober, but you can have a great time while being lifted.\nSo with that said, I curated a list of suggested strains for you to indulge in, depending on which sport you\u2019re going to see. Peep the list, use Leafly\u2019s Finder to locate the dispensaries stocking these strains, purchase, and enjoy some good ol\u2019 sportsball.\nStrains to Pair With Exciting Sports (Basketball, Football, Soccer, Hockey)\nSports that fall under this category are the types of sports that include constant back and forth action, which keeps you engaged from start to finish. A big play is always looming, so you\u2019re stuck to the edge of your seat because you don\u2019t want to miss that big dunk or the chance to yell \u201cGOOOOAAALLLLL\u201d in the face of whoever\u2019s sitting next to you. For that reason, you should indulge in strains that\u2019ll have you uplifted and energetic, feeling hyped and ready for that big moment.\n\u00a0 Candyland\nCandyland\u2019s a high-THC, sativa-dominant hybrid that\u2019ll have you super smacked without the paranoia. As a mix of Grandaddy Purple and Platinum GSC, it\u2019s got an earthy type of scent and a sweet flavor, with effects that will have you uplifted, engaged, and in a whole entire world of euphoria. Smoke these before an exciting sport and those big plays will feel that much bigger.\nFind Candyland Nearby\n\u00a0 Green Crack\nEveryone knows how good, energized, and focused Green Crack can make you feel. It\u2019s one of those strains that you can smoke and power through the day like you drank 84 cold brews, so it\u2019s perfect to smoke before a sporting event that you want to be locked into.\nFind Green Crack Nearby\n\u00a0 Cotton Candy Kush\nCotton Candy Kush is another high-THC strain that leaves you feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good, like Outkast on \u201cGhettoMusick.\u201d As a mix of Power Plant and Lavender, its powerful effects are relaxing yet still energetic while inducing happiness, freedom, and overall euphoria, so you\u2019ll be that much more excited when you see that Ronaldo bicycle kick for the game-winning goal live and in person.\nFind Cotton Candy Kush Nearby\n\u00a0 Stardawg\nStardawg is one of the best smelling, best tasting, most euphoric, most energetic, most everything strains I\u2019ve ever come across. Gifted to me by LTRMN in Portland, I smoked this and walked around the city for hours, falling in love with everything and everybody. It\u2019s definitely a strain I\u2019d recommend smoking before a sporting event, because every single dunk, touchdown, and goal will likely feel like the greatest moment in sports history for you.\nFind Stardawg Nearby\nStrains to Pair With Chill Sports (Baseball, Golf, Tennis)\nSports that fall under this category tend to be a lot more laid-back and reserved. Baseball games can be long and boring, and golf and tennis matches require damn near complete silence, with light clapping being the most excited you can get, so if you\u2019re overly hyped at any of them, you may feel a bit uncomfortable or out-of-place. These strains will help you lean a little more towards the indica side of things.\n\u00a0 Obama Kush\nObama Kush is a great indica with a relatively mild THC percentage that\u2019ll chill you out without knocking you out. I smoked a gram joint of Obama Kush a few weeks ago and knocked out the entire first season of Girls Incarcerated\u00a0on Netflix, which is still shorter than one full-length baseball game.\nFind Obama Kush Nearby\n\u00a0 Larry OG\nLarry OG is a hybrid of OG Kush and SFV OG, whose indica effects will overtake your body and have you with your feet in the air like your Cares-to-Give Meter is at zero. Smoke a little of this and you\u2019ll have no problem sitting through an entire round of golf, where the most exciting thing possible is a fox running across the course.\nFind Larry OG Nearby\n\u00a0 Cheese\nCheese is an indica-dominant hybrid that:\n\nactually smells like Cheese, which is wild; and\nwill have you feeling relaxed while avoiding the sleepy sleepy nap nap state of mind.\n\nYou can smoke some Cheese and kick back in comfort for hours, so if you\u2019re going to see one of the chill sports where everything\u2019s deathly silent and calm, Cheese is a good strain to indulge in beforehand.\nFind Cheese Nearby",

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Obama Kush is an indica strain with invigorating cerebral effects. Created by crossing OG Kush and a classic Afghani landrace strain, Obama Kush inherits a sweet earthy aroma that radiates with floral notes. This indica is a popular medical strain as it soothes the body without being too cumbersome on the mind.\nGrow Techniques: Like most indicas, Obama Kush grows short and stout. A SOG (sea of green) or SCROG (screen of green) method can maximize yields either indoors in a hydroponic setup or outdoors in a greenhouse. Air circulation, pruning, and training will also help to increase this strain\u2019s yield.\nFlowering Time: 8 to 9 weeks\nYield: Moderate\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Obama Kush can handle colder temperatures, but likes to be kept in a dry climate between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: This strain grows well indoors or outdoors. Be wary of excess moisture in the air when the buds begin to develop as they will be dense and at risk for molding.\u00a0\nFeeding: Feed heavier on the CalMag and introduce compost tea to keep the plant\u2019s immune system strong against mold.",
