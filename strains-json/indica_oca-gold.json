Hindu Kush is one of my favorite strains, but it\u0027s unfortunately tough to find where I live.\n\nIt smells wonderful - floral and hashy - and the taste is nice, too: floral, earth and hash. The effects, however, lean hard to the Afghani side. There\u0027s almost no head high at all, not even the contemplative spacey vibe that most indicas create, so the effect is all body.\n\nIt\u0027s a great strain if you want to relax and go to sleep, but if you\u0027re looking for some mental effects, I didn\u0027t get much of that at all.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sPaGuIbcIjKwcF8O7kQXXoAFJ6s=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fkfmswExdS0yqeEmdLkUQ_nerd-green.png"},{"id":1585381,"username":"Urdaga","text":"Itâ€™s been knocking everyone out fast lol","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sPaGuIbcIjKwcF8O7kQXXoAFJ6s=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fkfmswExdS0yqeEmdLkUQ_nerd-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":5,"flavors":[{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":10},{"name":"Sweet","score":10},{"name":"Flowery","score":10},{"name":"Honey","score":10},{"name":"Earthy","score":10}],"effects":[{"name":"Sleepy","score":40},{"name":"Relaxed","score":40},{"name":"Tingly","score":30},{"name":"Euphoric","score":10},{"name":"Happy","score":10}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":30},{"name":"Insomnia","score":20},{"name":"Pain","score":20},{"name":"Depression","score":10},{"name":"Fatigue","score":10}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":10},{"name":"Anxiety","score":10},{"name":"Arthritis","score":10},{"name":"Asthma","score":10},{"name":"Hypertension","score":10}],"negatives":[],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Eugene, OR","Springfield, OR","Gresham, OR","Newport, OR","Santa Ana, CA","Tigard, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/oca-gold","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.8/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"},{"name":"Hindu Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"hindu-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush","symbol":"Hk","applink":"leafly://strain/hindu-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
