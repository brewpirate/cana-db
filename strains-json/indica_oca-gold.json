            "text": "OCA Gold interested me because it's a Hindu Kush - Afghani cross. Hindu Kush is one of my favorite strains, but it's unfortunately tough to find where I live.\n\nIt smells wonderful - floral and hashy - and the taste is nice, too: floral, earth and hash. The effects, however, lean hard to the Afghani side. There's almost no head high at all, not even the contemplative spacey vibe that most indicas create, so the effect is all body.\n\nIt's a great strain if you want to relax and go to sleep, but if you're looking for some mental effects, I didn't get much of that at all.",
