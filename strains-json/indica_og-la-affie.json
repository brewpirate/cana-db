            "text": "This is a brilliant Indica! Surprisingly there's no couch lock effect that usually accommodates the heavy body buzz you get with this strain. Instead you're very uplifted almost energetic yet you keep the hefty body relax feel you get with great indicas. This blend helps to create a very nice focused effect that makes it easy to accomplish tasks if in the mood all the while that dense body buzz is relaxing the bodies aches and pains making it easy to melt to a couch if needed. considered your mind relaxed as well because this strain also eases stress and anxiety. This in large part may be due to this strain having no real paranoia side effect. All in all this is a wonderful strain great for when you need relief of the daily pains and stresses whether it during the morning up and go or the evening wind down.",
