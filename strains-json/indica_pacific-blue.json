    "description": "<p>Pacific Blue by Falcanna is a flavorful cut with a THC content that consistently reaches above 20%. This indica-dominant strain was bred by crossing the legendary Kush powerhouse <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/pre-98-bubba-kush\">Pre-98 Bubba Kush</a> with the fruity phenom <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/dj-short-blueberry\">DJ Short Blueberry</a>. These robust and flavorful genetics offer aromas of sweet skunk and blueberry with a smooth floral aftertaste. Pacific Blue&rsquo;s effects vary with dosage, but the onset is calming and euphoric, insulating the consumer in&nbsp;carefree bliss. This strain can get rather sedating with continued consumption, weighing on the limbs and gluing the body to the couch. Utilize Falcanna&rsquo;s Pacific Blue to help with headaches, nausea, anxiety, and restlessness. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
