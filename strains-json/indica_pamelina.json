            "text": "This is definitely an indica-dominant hybrid that has a more cerebral effect than your average indica. I found the \"munchie\" profile on this one to be quite a bit less than your average indica, but it does have quite a heavy body high with a nice, relaxing, and mildly sedating feel. Avoid daytime use.\n\nThe flavor is very interesting - the Rare Dankness parent is dominant on the scent with a hint of pine, ammonia, and diesel - with a trace of lemon - with a smooth flavor.  The only downside is that the strain will make you cough quite a lot. Overall, this is a good strain for an indica connoisseur.",

You\u2019ll be so busy enjoying the flavor that you won\u2019t notice that sedating effect creeping in. You\u2019ll be relaxed in no time. It\u2019s strong but it\u2019s not too heavy (connoisseurs will understand), which makes it a great candidate to use in small doses throughout the day or in larger quantities to knock your socks off.
