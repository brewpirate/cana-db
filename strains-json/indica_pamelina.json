I found the \"munchie\" profile on this one to be quite a bit less than your average indica, but it does have quite a heavy body high with a nice, relaxing, and mildly sedating feel. Avoid daytime use.\n\nThe flavor is very interesting - the Rare Dankness parent is dominant on the scent with a hint of pine, ammonia, and diesel - with a trace of lemon - with a smooth flavor.  The only downside is that the strain will make you cough quite a lot. Overall, this is a good strain for an indica connoisseur.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1535918,"username":"dragonbone","text":"ðŸ’£This is everything you want if youâ€™re a fan of indicas.

Youâ€™ll be relaxed in no time. Itâ€™s strong but itâ€™s not too heavy (connoisseurs will understand), which makes it a great candidate to use in small doses throughout the day or in larger quantities to knock your socks off.
