    "description": "<p>Papaya is an indica-dominant hybrid cannabis&nbsp;strain that is known for producing effects that might be more in line with a traditional sativa. The indica element of this strain does provide a mental calmness, but many consumers&nbsp;also find that this strain makes them energetic and productive. Nirvana Seeds bred this to be their take on a <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/indica/mango\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Mango</a> strain and crossed Citral #13 with <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Ice</a> #2 to make their own fruit. They met their own challenge and Papaya smells uncannily like its namesake. The taste is similar to its tropical fruit counterpart, but a spicy, peppery side also becomes apparent. The plants&nbsp;stay&nbsp;fairly short and thin, producing lots of fluffy buds with papaya-orange hairs in 8 or 9 weeks.</p>\n",

Unfortunately, I am sick, so I can't say much about the taste, or smell. =/. From what I am able to taste... I get slightly sweet, fruity undertone, over a piney, fresh clean smell, with a slight pungent edge. Produces a thick white smoke, quickly. It makes me cough easily. Pretty groggy feeling, I keep falling asleep as I write this... It makes you feel so relaxed, mellowed out... Where your body just goes limp, and you get such an overwhelming calmness....
