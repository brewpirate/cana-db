            "text": "Oh wow, this one\u2019s ridiculously good. A medium to slow come on that gradually grows in pleasure - like an orgasm in extreme slow motion. You may think that\u2019s hyperbolic, but the whole body literally radiates with pleasure. This degree of physical feel good-ness, euphoria, and sensory accentuation -all coupled with an impressive \u201dgoneness\u201d catapult this high into the hallucinogenic echelons of LSD. Initial rush of come on does temper out into a calmer, more chilled stone. But goddamn, music is all-encompassing. Visuals are rich and powerful, narrow focus seems to narrow depth of field, making the dimensionality of things very striking. Despite strong, intoxicating effects the mental space stays calm, collected. Noticeably slowed/disabled, but happy and surprisingly competent at conveying thoughts. Provides perfect, cozy zone out times...ideal for time passage. Think I\u2019m going to have to give this one a perfect score.",
