Squinted feeling to my eyes, very heavy head feeling and stoned in my brain feeling. I feel slow as heck in my mind. I feel focused at the same time. I don't know about the taste. It tastes like really good clean bud. Just good delicious clean meds. Great stuff. I just baked some chocolate chip cookies and they taste sooo good. Food is so bomb on this strain. This one has me feeling just happy and good inside. I really hope the indica side of this strain comes on heavily and putts me to sleep for the whole night. I feel relaxed for sure. 5 star strain for sure. I love these OG strains.",

I don't think it makes me as sedated as described but be careful if your not used to indicas before driving, etc.  Otherwise, a nice, mellow-inducing and tasty indica that pairs well with chill vibes (musicalsuggestion: Popul Vuh or post rock).",
