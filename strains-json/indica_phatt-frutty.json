            "text": "This stuff is amazing.  Bought today at Jardin Henderson, made by Green Therapeutics (looks like right here in Nevada, if so go local boys), called Phat Fruity (instead of Frutty) but same mix noted here of Afghan, Indian and Mexican hybrid.\n\nThe smell is amazing on first open, strong lemon smell but earthy; never been great at describing the smells.  Smells like fire weed, what more do you want?\n\nBag appeal? Wow...I was going to get a 1/4 of Gelato and after seeing this in the jar I swear the crystals winked at me (ok not really, I hadn\u2019t smoked yet) but it did glisten with every turn of the jar so I switched out one of the Gelato\u2019s for this. \n\nI use a Volcano digital and only vape flowers, not a weed crack person but if they had this in a concentrate, buy it.  I will vape a full bowl and various temperatures and once that bowl is gone that equates in my mind to the same as one bowl in a bong (it\u2019s weed math and it works, don\u2019t argue because you\u2019re wrong, it\u2019s ok).  I will typically get 4 solid tasting full bags before it becomes ABV.   I\u2019ve been smoking for 20 years, that means nothing because the shit in high school was not weed compared to today. \n\nFirst setting at 365f (my usual starter), bag is lightly cloudy and first puff...inhale lemon, little earth but mostly that traditional indica flavor.  Hold for a minute and exhale now is totally different, it is almost entirely pine/earth tasting which is great (its weed guys it\u2019s not chocolate) and smooth. \n\nHigh kicks in within first big inhale, unusual for a vape, right behind the eyes and light body; becoming more difficult to type this correctly as iPhone buttons are a tad warbly (yes it\u2019s a word shut up).  Played some South Park and now onto the second bag. (30 minutes later...) \n\nThis one is bumped to 376f; same flavor profile but harsher on the inhale.  Bag has just a hint more cloudiness, deep inhale with only about a 30 second hold but around that time you feel it immensely in the eyes and immediately throughout the body.  I\u2019ve stopped playing South Park at this time to watch Forensic files because my mind seems more apt to watch about crazy people work than figure out buttons on a controller.  I can\u2019t feel my face.  \n\nTwo bags at 376f - this is almost the perfect temperature all the way through, it hits every component of your body both physically and mentally without couch locking or zoning out entirely.  The screen is getting a tad blurrier though in kind of a mindfog sort of way.\n\nFinal bag, 392f; this releases all the final content I\u2019m looking for in cannabis but is a tad harsh.  The flavor profile dwindles dramatically and the high becomes more lethargic than wanting to be active.  You are couch locked, welcome to whatever you were doing because if the remotes are to far away you\u2019re about to have a difficult time.  The bonus is that this weed will also turn you into MacGuyver and you will find a way to get to that remote using cannagenuity and because you\u2019ve already seen that episode of forensic files around 20 times and can\u2019t stand to watch it again.\n\nShort version:  Buy it, it good, it smoke and vape good, you get very very high in a hugely amazing Indica Dominant but strong Sativa hybrid.\n\n9.8/10\n\nI think I\u2019ll go play Mario Kart now...\n\n",
