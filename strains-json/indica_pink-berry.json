            "text": "For every color in the rainbow there is a complementing strain ready to match each individual\u2019s absolute favorite hue. Only drink out of blue cups? Wear a lot of purple?\u00a0 Refuse to eat something that isn\u2019t orange-tinted? Pair your number one color with a little bit of green! Below we list a strain pairing that goes hand in hand with each letter in ROYGBIV.\nRed\n\nFiery, passionate, sensual \u2013 red is a power color that tends to\u00a0allure the sexes and could\u00a0possibly give you a promotion. Pair this magnetic color with the \u201cspeedy and intense\u201d Panama Red, a full sativa that will match that flash of red lipstick or vibrant watch band.\nOrange\n\nThis warm and fizzy hue can only pair best with a warm and fizzy strain. Enter Orange Crush \u2013 its sweet and tangy flavor perfectly complements its twin color.\nYellow\n\nIn the dead of winter, yellow reminisces sunny days and lemonade. Try Lemon Haze to melt the frost \u2013 it\u2019s a citrusy sativa whose buds appear green and yellow. The\u00a0lemony taste will bring back your sunny disposition through these chilly months.\nGreen\n\nWith 2017\u2019s color of the year being \u201cgreenery,\u201d the hybrid Green Dream is an excellent addition to any green stash.\nBlue\n\nBlue has always been a fan favorite and possibly the most popular color of the rainbow \u2013 it\u2019s calming, tranquil, and makes one think of the sky and the sea. The hybrid ArcticBlue\u00a0pairs well with this peaceful color and\u00a0its anti-anxiety effects.\nHonorable mention goes to the hybrid\u00a0Blue Dream, a strain that has become just as popular as the color itself.\nIndigo\n\nIndigo is the in-between of purple and blue \u2013 a deep, gorgeous hue that can only be complemented by the hybrid strain Blurple. It\u2019s the best mix of Blue Dream and Mendocino Purps, just as indigo is the best mix of purple and blue, aka \u201cblurple.\u201d\nViolet\n\nA color that\u00a0received its name from the violet flower, it\u2019s only logical to pair this beautiful hue with the hybrid strain Violet Delight. It releases a strong floral flavor that will\u00a0have you dreaming in shades of purple.\nIf your favorite color is outside of the rainbow spectrum, we have a couple of honorary mentions for you to pick up.\n\nPink\n\nThough pink is not technically a color of the rainbow, we couldn\u2019t leave out this bubblegum pop favorite. Pair that Pepto-Bismol toned jacket that\u2019s been collecting dust in your closet with the sweet and fruity indica Pink Berry.\nBlack\n\nFor those who live and breathe in\u00a0waves of black, don\u2019t pass up the indica Black Domina. It\u2019s a strain designed for late night,\u00a0so\u00a0grab your best black pajamas, black slippers, black robe, and pull in this heavy strain deep into the night.",

It did relax my body, gave me mild euphoric feeling, all while keeping a clear head. 4stars for all the above mentioned effects but not as potent or sleep inducing for me (long time pothead here) however results may vary lol",
