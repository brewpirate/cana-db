    "description": "<p>Pink Panties is a cross of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/burmese-kush\">Burmese Kush</a> and a Florida Kush backcross. It expresses dense, medium-sized buds that reek of tart and tangy citrus alongside a strong floral bouquet. This strain delivers a smooth smoking experience that is citrus-forward, but lightly herbal on the exhale. Consumers can find value in Pink Panties&rsquo; potent but functional sedation, which may help abate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD.</p>\n",

And some other herbal after favors that slowly creep in after exhale!. And the medical and even recreational effects are beyond amazing I would recommend this to anyone with pain issues because the pain relief of this strain is beyond oxycodone even. The mental state you enter is, of course, heavily dependant on your need and expectations. But if you go for it free ride and open. You will find a very amazing trippy type high. You are in control and having a blast. Enjoy this strain because I sure will. Take me away pink panties! OFF TO FANTASYLAND!.",
