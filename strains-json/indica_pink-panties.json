Not only is it strong. But the taste of citrus and hints of flowery niceness. Almost has a sweetness to it as well. And some other herbal after favors that slowly creep in after exhale!. And the medical and even recreational effects are beyond amazing I would recommend this to anyone with pain issues because the pain relief of this strain is beyond oxycodone even. The mental state you enter is, of course, heavily dependant on your need and expectations. But if you go for it free ride and open. You will find a very amazing trippy type high. You are in control and having a blast. Enjoy this strain because I sure will. Take me away pink panties!
