Just a soft, cottony body buzz, ultra powerful pain relief, incredibly relaxed, zero anxiety/paranoia, and light insomnia relief.   I would HIGHLY recommend Pitbull to cancer and chemothearapy patients - it should PULVERIZE your nausea and pain.  As for hunger, this has been a non munchie strain to me.  For some, that\u0027s a blessing -- I\u0027ve become a bit of a fatass and need to lose weight.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"},{"id":1635761,"username":"Crystalstutu","text":"hard core energy buzz with a tad bit of the jitters, mellows out after a bit into a creative whirlwind ","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":158,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":48.214447463768117},{"name":"Flowery","score":41.171875},{"name":"Woody","score":27.433197463768114},{"name":"Pungent","score":21.041666666666668},{"name":"Tree Fruit","score":20.390625}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":118.24728260869566},{"name":"Sleepy","score":107.20788043478261},{"name":"Happy","score":61.337182971014492},{"name":"Hungry","score":52.601902173913047},{"name":"Tingly","score":51.860280797101446}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Insomnia","score":35.036231884057969},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":28.605072463768114},{"name":"Fatigue","score":23.345788043478262},{"name":"Pain","score":20.855978260869563},{"name":"Stress","score":15.947690217391305}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":17.8611865942029},{"name":"PMS","score":6.9123641304347823},{"name":"PTSD","score":6.0405344202898545},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":5.2592844202898545},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.8686594202898545}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":40.425724637681164},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":7.8634510869565215},{"name":"Dizzy","score":3.8666213768115938},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.9551630434782608},{"name":"Anxious","score":2.6947463768115938}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pitbull_100x100_d4c9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/616113/b/pitbull__primary_6820.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pitbull_100x100_2c71.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/521558/b/pitbull__primary_c239.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pitbull_100x100_792b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/516243/b/pitbull__primary_482c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pitbull_100x100_0814.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/496467/b/pitbull__primary_7d14.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pitbull_100x100_2741.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/473582/b/pitbull__primary_51d0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pitbull_100x100_88e5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/473516/b/pitbull__primary_3568.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":36,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Eugene, OR","Seattle, WA","Shoreline, WA","Spokane Valley, WA","Tacoma, WA","Beaverton, OR","Bremerton, WA","Coos Bay, OR","Everett, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/pitbull","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.28481012658228/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"P-91","subtitle":null,"slug":"p-91","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/p-91","symbol":"P91","applink":"leafly://strain/p-91"},{"name":"Sugar Plum","subtitle":null,"slug":"sugar-plum","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/sugar-plum","symbol":"Spl","applink":"leafly://strain/sugar-plum"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
