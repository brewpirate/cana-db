Like sinking into a nice pillow.\r\n\r\nI didn\u0027t have a strong feeling one way or the other for the smoke. (Although my vape broke and I had to use my little water pipe -- so I tasted a LOT more smoke than I usually do. I will review again when my beloved vape is back in action.)\r\n\r\nBut the high is very nice combination body/head high. A calmly centered high. The creative buzzing is there, but turned to low simmer so it\u0027s not always poking at you. The body is relaxed, but not couch-locked. You can do necessary stuff; but the high is not what I\u0027d describe as \"energizing.\" (I actually found it a pretty helpful space for writing.)\r\n\r\nThis one really feels like a 60/40 Indica dominant hybrid. But I understand it\u0027s full Indica. Mild but pure.  (Damn, I just reread those last two sentences -- I\u0027m really starting to sound like a pothead).\r\n\r\nIt occurs to me this would be a good choice for a family dinner. You want to be high, but you don\u0027t want your grandparents to know you\u0027re high. On this, you feel nicely chilled -- but you\u0027re neither a zombie idiot with zero energy nor a super-charged, but unfocused thinking machine. \r\n\r\nI think you could be pretty much \"just right\" at the dinner table with P. Kush, i.e., a smiling, charming, occasionally witty dinner companion. Just what the grandparents (and parents!) want to see -- and you want to give. \r\n\r\nIts charm is that it is very relaxing, but its real gift can only be appreciated if you allow it in and don\u0027t fight it. Turn yourself over to the Kush (Platinum version, no less) and let him hold you down -- and then you must choose to let go. At that moment -- at the precise point where your need to push against is equaled by your acceptance of being pushed -- you realize right then -- that you are just where you ought to be.\r\n\r\nP. Kush pushes you toward Nirvana -- but in the end it\u0027s up to you -- whether you touch it or not.\r\n\r\nGradually blasting off now...","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1638864,"username":"Blotterfall","text":"Another indica I definitely am fond of, but not blown away with.

Leafly and Botanicare are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Platinum Kush is supposedly a cross between an Afghani strain and Master Kush. Regardless of its lineage, it stands alone as a unique and powerful indica strain. Named for its shiny coat of resin that leaves the buds shimmering, this strain delivers a skunky gasoline aroma and deeply sedating effects.\nGrow Techniques: This strain is an excellent candidate for the SOG (sea of green) grow method. The plants stay short and dense, and they are generally resistant to mold. Grow this strain hydroponically indoors or take it outdoors to be grown in soil. Prune lower foliage to keep the energy directed towards the buds receiving full sun. Make sure you have a few pairs of scissors in rotation while you trim this plant–Platinum Kush’s resin production makes for a sticky end product.\nFlowering Time: 8 to 9 weeks\nYield: High \nGrow Difficulty: Moderate \nClimate: Platinum Kush’s resistance to mold makes it a popular strain to grow where moisture content is high in the fall. It performs best in temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Suitable for either indoor or outdoor gardens.\nFeeding: Platinum Kush can take heavy nutrients to keep the resin production up. Feed heavily with nitrogen and CalMag early on in the vegetative stage while moving to phosphorus-heavy foods during flowering.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/21144848/platinum-kush-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-platinum-kush-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":572,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":21.762315458023174},{"name":"Earthy","score":21.159489842422904},{"name":"Flowery","score":15.531736386360812},{"name":"Woody","score":10.986318459491681},{"name":"Pungent","score":10.704873243197207}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":74.912936697556},{"name":"Sleepy","score":54.130874615034038},{"name":"Euphoric","score":53.648487526872806},{"name":"Happy","score":47.660511814829647},{"name":"Uplifted","score":33.8292431419667}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":30.01687175166991},{"name":"Stress","score":29.758559018906485},{"name":"Insomnia","score":26.995838454704064},{"name":"Depression","score":20.176186661879051},{"name":"Headaches","score":18.26827466198953}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":23.860466240384483},{"name":"PTSD","score":16.491907083373615},{"name":"Arthritis","score":10.607567199289221},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":10.251948422617813},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":9.3428188024508909}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":17.942290783374073},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":15.429826863143163},{"name":"Dizzy","score":6.9743286976296677},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.5167313455509674},{"name":"Headache","score":0.78236130867709808}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-kush_100x100_2edd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001100/b/platinum-kush__primary_69f0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-kush_100x100_1277.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001099/b/platinum-kush__primary_285b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-kush_100x100_0264.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000832/b/platinum-kush__primary_5dfa.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-kush_100x100_0bce.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000705/b/platinum-kush__primary_ad15.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-kush_100x100_7846.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000702/b/platinum-kush__primary_ab78.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-kush_100x100_87e7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/704686/b/platinum-kush__primary_1e3e.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":287,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Seattle, WA","Toronto, ON","Eugene, OR","Montréal, QC","Spokane, WA","Vancouver, BC","Calgary, AB","Denver, CO","Bellingham, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/platinum-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.38636363636364/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":59,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
