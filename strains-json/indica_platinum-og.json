Platinum OG is a heavy sedative, yet also strangely uplifting and energizing. The high begins with a bit of the giggles, the lowers you into a great buzz that feels like settling into a warm blanket. Then you are relaxed and sedated. This earthy strain is great to take the edge off of a stressefull day, or body pains. Just make sure you have everything you,need to get done, DONE. You wont after you have enjoyed this strain.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/ZtQxS6XT_MjOwMadRkRsU9ZNU-I=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fX2q7eTOS7WxMAnwrLSBM_wide-brim-green.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":645,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":25.320915320452656},{"name":"Pine","score":15.517313259517389},{"name":"Woody","score":10.940863522523557},{"name":"Pungent","score":8.3964453238997514},{"name":"Flowery","score":7.41323541823218}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":72.715791657218517},{"name":"Sleepy","score":48.899751585510813},{"name":"Happy","score":41.945315256594988},{"name":"Euphoric","score":40.652400713009584},{"name":"Tingly","score":25.391687520400389}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":32.16143992955319},{"name":"Insomnia","score":28.15081189745759},{"name":"Pain","score":21.320709918378096},{"name":"Depression","score":20.618173812862441},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":13.555240447532482}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":29.2744222558232},{"name":"PTSD","score":15.900993149535763},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":13.297852328110496},{"name":"PMS","score":10.86848979649942},{"name":"Arthritis","score":6.9611983279050929}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":33.354220961790134},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":21.449416688613503},{"name":"Dizzy","score":10.669824299878895},{"name":"Paranoid","score":5.3996595613140439},{"name":"Headache","score":2.7519047991889667}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-og_100x100_f9f1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1006197/b/platinum-og__primary_b58b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-og_100x100_7e3c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002774/b/platinum-og__primary_f671.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-og_100x100_62a7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/706541/b/platinum-og__primary_cc48.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-og_100x100_546b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/705486/b/platinum-og__primary_5312.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-og_100x100_0b50.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/659100/b/platinum-og__primary_6939.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/platinum-og_100x100_15c0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/649231/b/platinum-og__primary_e7ee.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":227,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA","Portland, OR","Detroit, MI","China","San Diego, CA","Phoenix, AZ","Seattle, WA","Montr√©al, QC","Salem, OR","San Francisco, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/platinum-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.42015503875969/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Master Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"master-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/master-kush","symbol":"Mks","applink":"leafly://strain/master-kush"},{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":56,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
