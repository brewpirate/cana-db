(I didn't remember anything I did during the time I peaked)\n\nThis is one the best strains I have smoked. Very powerful. \nIt hits very fast. Very intense peak. It felt more like a hybrid to me. Smoking a small amount I felt euphoric, uplifted, creative, energetic and relaxed. Smoking a large amount I felt very stoned. \nThe peak is great. After peak still a strong high. It made concentration and social activities easy. \nYou will feel high. 5/5",

The high begins with a bit of the giggles, the lowers you into a great buzz that feels like settling into a warm blanket. Then you are relaxed and sedated. This earthy strain is great to take the edge off of a stressefull day, or body pains. Just make sure you have everything you,need to get done, DONE. You wont after you have enjoyed this strain.",
