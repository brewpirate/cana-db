It is said that the farther away from the sun the stronger the stain is, well I don't really care if that's true because this is one of my favorite strains.  Super strong effects that allow anyone to sleep easily and manage their pain.  Sleep is the best way to avoid the munchies.",

The aroma is a combination of Jack Herer\u2019s fruitiness with skunk. It is amazing. \n\nThe effects are awesome and potent. Instant sedation. Think tranquilizer dart. And this is from a 1-2g/ day smoker. (3g on weekends \ud83d\ude11)\n\nWhat\u2019s confusing is you can still speak and think. For a while. It\u2019s pretty heady, but in large quantities (>1g) you\u2019re going to be pretty. Dopey.\n\nThose are my favorite strains. And there aren\u2019t many out there. ",
