It is said that the farther away from the sun the stronger the stain is, well I don\u0027t really care if that\u0027s true because this is one of my favorite strains.  Super strong effects that allow anyone to sleep easily and manage their pain.  Sleep is the best way to avoid the munchies.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1584010,"username":"JoeInLA","text":"Bought an HP of this strain. Had never had it but the deal was too good. Didnâ€™t try it till I busted open the vacuum bag. The aroma is a combination of Jack Hererâ€™s fruitiness with skunk. It is amazing. \n\nThe effects are awesome and potent. Instant sedation. Think tranquilizer dart. And this is from a 1-2g/ day smoker. (3g on weekends ðŸ˜‘)\n\nWhatâ€™s confusing is you can still speak and think. For a while. Itâ€™s pretty heady, but in large quantities (\u003e1g) youâ€™re going to be pretty. Dopey.\n\nThose are my favorite strains. And there arenâ€™t many out there.
