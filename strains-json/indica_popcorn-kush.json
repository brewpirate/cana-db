            "text": "January 19th is National Popcorn Day, a time to celebrate our favorite snack that gets magically transformed from tooth-cracking kernels to light, fluffy pillows of yum. Whether you enjoy it drenched in fake movie theater butter, in Cracker Jack form, or adorned with bold flavors like Sriracha, the versatility of popcorn guarantees it to be a top treat for many snackers.\nOur favorite iteration of popcorn, of course, is Popcorn Kush, an indica-dominant hybrid that actually smells and tastes like popcorn. Don\u2019t believe me? Check out some review highlights that not only attest to its aroma and flavor, but allege that Popcorn Kush is great for a variety of things.\nPopcorn Kush Makes You\u2026\n\nWant to Enjoy It at Movie Theaters\n\n\u201cThey should sell this at movies in giant buckets!
