It is very good for rapidly relieving pain, but my top use is for IMMEDIATELY DEFUSING INTERNAL STRESS/POTENTIAL PSYCHOTIC EPISODES.\r\n\r\n2 tokes will take you from \"OMG!! The sky is falling!!!\" to *puff* \"What's happening?...*puff* Yes, let's handle this.\"\r\n\r\nTitrate gingerly as hitting it too hard may relax you beyond the point of being able to focus on dealing with a problem. \r\n\r\nRecreationally, Pot O' Gold is great for kick-back funzies: movies, video games, etc.\r\n\r\nBe Healthy (especially in Mind & Spirit).",
