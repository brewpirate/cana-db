But lately I\u0027ve been having some new issues with MJ that I\u0027ve never had before... so this strain was a pleasant surprise. I don\u0027t know if my body and hormones are just changing or what, but lately I\u0027ve become a one-hit wonder and very sensitive to pot. I\u0027ll smoke my normal amount and suddenly feel anxious or paranoid, even like I have to lay down with dizziness at times.\nI believe some of this has to do with the increasing potency of marijuana, especially at the medical level. Part of my issue is I think I stopped smoking enough to develop a high tolerance for these medical strains and so I decided to cut back on how many times I hit the weed when I smoke now. I\u0027ve been searching for a really good indica (I stopped smoking sativa because of its tendency to increase my anxiety) with a body buzz. I bought this strain and just smoked a bowl of it and guys: oh my god. It\u0027s been weeks since I have been able to enjoy marijuana how I was enjoying it before I started to have all these issues. In my mind, I am relaxed and able to be rational when my anxiety is present. My body, in its places of pain, feels tingly and warm. I overall feel very mellow, non-anxious, and a little couchlocked, although I also have an itch to go to Target and stumble around buying things I need with a smile on my face. I feel a body high most in my lower back and sacrum usually, and I have a totally lightweight, beautiful tingling, warm sensation in this area right now. If you have any back pain or benefit from yoga, I would suggest doing some body stretching on this strain. My pains feel so much better now. And I\u0027m not getting any of the anxiety, jitters, or paranoia I\u0027ve been experiencing lately. I finally found what I needed with this  strain.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"},{"id":1639269,"username":"Adam5","text":"Feeling an affinity with this bud since I\u0027m from the blank generation..err um \u0027Y generation\u0027.

This is like my favorite high with its mellow woody taste not too stanky (kinda how a lot of weed was \u0027round here back in the day) and crispy rich in trichomes. Mmm. If I knew then what I know now. Makes you feel no pain, no insomnia.
