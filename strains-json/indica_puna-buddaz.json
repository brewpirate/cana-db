            "text": "Mahalo (Thanks) @Leafly for giving Puna Buddaz such a sweet review!\n\nPuna Buddaz is an amazing survivor and true legend in da Pakal\u014dl\u014d kingdom.\n\nShe handles da tropical monsoon downpours of da Puna District on da Big Island of Hawai\u2019i like a champ. Many Puna growers will tell you after particularly rainy seasons, Puna Buddaz is da last plant standing when many other strains have already succumb to mold issues.\n\nPuna Buddaz is a very special lil lady and is our #1 pick for growing mold resistant strains in Hawai\u2019i.\n\nPuna Buddaz even performs well for our mainland \u2018Ohana on da west coast who have grown her in OR and CA with great results.\n\nPuna Buddaz flowers in 55-60 days amassing heavy loads of resin and trichomes, perhaps another reason she beats da mold is her fast flower time.\n\nA small resinous plant that produces huge clusters of da mos 'ono (delicious) Pakalolo da islands have to offer!\n\nPuna Buddaz packs a mean Hawaiian punch and is not for the faint of heart!\n\nBlessed with both a very intense physical and mental high that will have you on cloud nine in paradise!\n\nA tripped out spinning psychedelic brain effect that could even be dangerous to the uninitiated Punatic.",
