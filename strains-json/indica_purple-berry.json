Even though it\u0027s labeled as an indica it still has a little bit of a head high. I can still function off of it as well, but this is best right before bed. Helps me exceptionally with insomnia and stress, and any soreness or pain is gone after a few seconds. A fantastic choice to watch a movie with. One of my new favorite strains, need to go pick up some more of this!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"},{"id":1631315,"username":"DrMota","text":"GDPxBlueberry you would think it would be a Powerhouse Strain.
