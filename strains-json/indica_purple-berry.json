It stays true to its colorful lineage and produces dense green flowers that are streaked with purples and blues, and sometimes pinks and oranges. Purple Berry gives off a sweet smell with just a hint of nuttiness; the taste follows suit with an overwhelmingly Blueberry flavor. This is a heavy indica for sure, but many users report that it is less sedative and allows for some mental alertness while providing a strong body buzz.</p>\n",

I can still function off of it as well, but this is best right before bed. Helps me exceptionally with insomnia and stress, and any soreness or pain is gone after a few seconds. A fantastic choice to watch a movie with. One of my new favorite strains, need to go pick up some more of this!",
