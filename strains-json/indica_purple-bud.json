            "text": "Born in 1960s Jamaica, reggae was an evolution of its predecessors: ska and rocksteady. The genre quickly took on a life of its own and eventually made its way to the United States, where it became a staple of 1960s culture. It also carved a special niche in the cannabis world, since reggae\u2019s penchant for political lyrics did not shy away from the topic of legalization.\n\nIt\u2019s a genre that is powerful in both its unique sound and inherently political roots. It is music that uplifts the spirit and rallies the heart.\u00a0The era of reggae produced a plethora of iconic artists such as Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, The Abyssinians, and Toots & The Maytals\u2014the latter of whom actually coined the term \u2018reggae\u2019 with the 1968 single, \u201cDo The Reggay.\u201d\nTo better understand and appreciate the genre, pack a pipe, grab your friends, and explore the soulful reggae music below\u2014each album we suggest is an ideal match for the right cannabis strain.\nStony Hill by Damian Marley\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: King\u2019s Bread\nYoungest son of the legendary Bob Marley, Damian Marley continues his father\u2019s legacy in reggae with his own fresh sound. Stony Hill is Marley\u2019s newest album\u2014released in July of this year, it combines modern electronic elements with classic reggae beats. Stony Hill feels like the next modern step in a continuously growing genre that refuses to lose its heart along the way.\nIn true reggae style, Marley\u2019s lyrics do not shy away from telling honest and human stories. From wondering what the future will bring on one track, while impeccable backup vocals chime \u201cbelieve in your dreams\u201d on another, the album explores the depth of human character.\nThis 18-track album also features the song \u201cMedication\u201d featuring Marley\u2019s brother and guest artist, Stephen Marley. The song is an ode to Marley\u2019s love of \u201cMary Jane\u201d and the medicinal power of cannabis. You\u2019ll be singing along to the lyrics, \u201cAnd I say to myself, what a wonderful herb.\u201d\n\nSevana EP by Sevana\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Purple Bud\nHailing from Kingston, Jamaica, Sevana burst onto the scene last year with her first EP album, where she delivers stunning, expert vocals and impactful reggae beats. The album begins with the softer ballad \u201cCarry You\u201d before launching into the groovy \u201cBit Too Shy,\u201d which sets the tone for the rest of the collection.\nThe EP\u2019s music will get you moving to the rhythm, while Sevana\u2019s energetic and heartfelt vocals delight across the soundscape with perfect control and beautiful clarity. Sevana captures the heart of reggae in her music, vocals, and lyrics for a complete immersion in classic reggae via a modern recording artist. Sevana\u2019s debut album proves she\u2019s an artist to watch and gives us high hopes of more great albums to come.\nEqual Rights by Peter Tosh\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Jah Kush\nAlong with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh got his start as part of The Wailers. Afterwards, he went on to become his own successful solo artist and produced many iconic albums, including\u00a0Equal Rights\u00a0in 1977.\nEqual Rights opens with the familiar song, \u201cGet Up, Stand Up,\u201d performed with Tosh\u2019s unique style and sound. The album contains classics such as \u201cDownpressor Man\u201d and \u201cStepping Razor,\u201d and features Tosh\u2019s punctuated and mellow vocals accompanied by melodies that are rich, vibrant, and smooth.\nAs a whole, Equal Rights is an iconic reggae album that encapsulates the heart and soul of reggae as it was at the time of its initial emergence onto the popular scene. For this reason, it will always reign as a powerful memento of reggae\u2019s roots.\n\nAfrican Holocaust by Steel Pulse\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Malawi\nReleased in 2004, African Holocaust\u00a0is the latest in a long line of albums produced by Steel Pulse. Though over a decade old, it remains relevant today both musically as well as lyrically, touching on topics such as global warming, corruption in government and religion, and the ramifications of slavery.\nFormed in 1975 in Birmingham, England, Steel Pulse has had a somewhat rotating cast of players over the years, but always with lead singer David Hinds at the forefront holding down vocals and rhythm guitar.\nAfrican Holocaust is no exception, with Hinds\u2019s fierce voice leading the upbeat reggae melodies that encourage dance and reflection all at once. It is this combination of poignant lyrics and stunningly composed music full of drums and horns that makes\u00a0African Holocaust such a noteworthy album.\nRebirth by Jimmy Cliff\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lamb\u2019s Bread\nRebirth was released in 2012 as part of what Jimmy Cliff said was \u201ca rebirth of my career at this time.\u201d It was the first album Cliff had released in eight years, and went on to win a Grammy for Best Reggae Album. Cliff has been producing reggae music since the 1960s and is one of the few original artists who still produces new music today while touring or appearing at festivals (such as Lockn\u2019 in 2015).\nRebirth manages to encapsulate Cliff\u2019s classic reggae feel while shining anew with crisp, fresh, updated sounds. The 13-track album features new, original music as well as some covers\u2014all of it exceedingly lively, joyful, and brimming with energy.",

            "text": "These strains were just added to the Leafly database and they're in some need of some user love. Have you chanced upon any of these varieties in your strain quests? Let us know by leaving a review. We've also included links to help you find out whether or not that strain is being offered at a location near you, so get shopping!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Venus OG\n\nAnother member of the \u201cplanetary series,\u201d Venus OG is a hybrid strain bearing OG Kush heritage, although its specific parent strains are disputed. Each glistening trichome carries a resemblance to the bright planet this strain is named after, coating its conic buds in a galactic blanket of white crystals. A fresh pine aroma mixed with sour notes of lemon draws you in, and next comes the heavy euphoria to take away your sense of gravity and lift you to a happy, relaxed place.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Venus OG\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Moondance\n\nMoondance is a sativa-dominant strain that offers a CBD content as high as 11%. With an average THC level of just 4%, consumers will notice only minimal cerebral, euphoric sensations. Candied grape aromas turn to spicy pepper, fresh mint, and sharp pine flavors on the exhale. Stress, body aches, and painful inflammation wither away while the mind is left agile and clear, making this strain an excellent daytime choice for patients and those needing to stay active. Inheriting genetics from Super Silver Haze, Neville\u2019s Haze, and an unknown CBD-rich parent, Moondance is a variation of the better-known MediHaze sativa.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Moondance\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Purple Bud\n\nFrom Sensi Seeds comes the purple-blossomed indica Purple Bud, appropriately named for its bright hues of lavender. A descendant of Afghani indicas, this colorful plant offers large harvests of sparkling buds that carry the sweet and piney aroma of sandalwood. A distant sativa relative from Jamaica gives this strain a little added height and cerebral invigoration, but Purple Bud\u2019s effects generally fall heavy on both mind and body. After crossing the Afghani indicas with a Jamaican sativa, Sensi Seeds added genetics from a Dutch Hindu Kush and a California Purple Kush.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Shangri-La\n\nTaking its name from the mythical valley utopia, the Shangri-La hybrid is sure to bring you to your own internal paradise. This 60/40 sativa-dominant strain takes you to a peaceful mindset where happiness and relaxation are no strangers. Patients might also choose this strain as an uplifting escape from nausea, stress, and pain. Skunky and sweet in flavor, Shangri-La boasts a garden of different aromas from ripe grape and berry to tropical mango and citrus. Bred by JinxProof Genetics and propagated by TGA Genetics, Shangri-La crosses parent strains Fudo Myo-o and 9 Pound Hammer.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Shangri-La\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Sweet Jane\n\nSweet Jane is a sweet-flavored sativa strain that provides an uplifting burst of cerebral energy ideal for daytime use. A selected cut of the famous Island Sweet Skunk, Sweet Jane carries an intense fruity aroma with notes of grapefruit, lemon, and mangos. Colorful calyxes spiral from the buds, woven in fiery hairs and powdered in a sugary coat of crystal resin. With an average THC content of 20% and a subtle CBD profile, Sweet Jane delivers nuanced effects perfect for both relaxing and getting things done.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Sweet Jane\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. The Doctor\n\nBred by Green House Seeds, The Doctor is an indica-dominant strain designed to treat a myriad of unpleasant symptoms such as pain, nausea, appetite loss, and insomnia. Its name also comes in tribute to the motorcycle racer Valentino Rossi, also called \u201cThe Doctor.\u201d Heavy sedating effects act fast, leaving you feeling pacified and calm. Earthy flavors soured by skunky, fruity notes arrive on the inhale, making their exit with the taste of hashy spice. Great White Shark, Super Skunk, and an unnamed South Indian parent lend The Doctor its genetic blueprint.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Purple Goat\n\nPurple Goat is a hybrid cross between Trainwreck and Blueberry Skunk, created by Oregon OMMP growers in the early 2010s. With a mostly sativa growth pattern, Purple Goat produces dense indica buds of a dark purple hue with a rich palate of sweet grass and spicy herbs. An early flowerer, Purple Goat will finish its maturation cycle by the end of September outdoors. When consumed, Purple Goat has an earthy taste with blueberry overtones and provides a feeling of deep relaxation.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Purple Goat\n\u00a0\nBrowse through other new strains that were added recently to the Leafly Explorer or check out last week's newest additions!",
