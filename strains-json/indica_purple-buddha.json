However I would recommend this to anyone. For most people it would be a perfect night time/ relaxation tool. \r\n\r\nHowever if you are into meditation or yoga, or anything like that, this purple Buddha is the perfect accessory (and this has nothing to do with the name). How well it tunes you into your body is amazing and it will help focus you throughout whatever you are doing.\r\nThe come up is very smooth as well as the come down. Overall its an amazing bud and one of my favorites of all time.\r\nBe warned though, not for beginners. With great power comes great responsibility, and this is VERY powerful bud. You are higher than you feel. \r\n ",
