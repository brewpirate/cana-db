            "text": "While picking up some new strains at the dispensary yesterday, my budtender began by asking, \u201cAre you looking for an indica or a sativa?\u201d Her question is a reflection of how most people think about strains: sativas are for staying active and indicas are for relaxing. Sometimes, however, strains can surprise us and exhibit traits that we wouldn\u2019t normally associate with their indica or sativa types.\n\nCannabis strains are more variable than one might think. Their nuanced effects often transcend the basic indica-sativa classification system and are influenced by a number of other factors:\n\nYour personal physiology and brain chemistry\nYour mood and energy level\nHow the strain was grown and which genetic traits that particular plant expressed (cannabis nerds, see this primer on genotypes and phenotypes)\nDelivery method and dose\nExpectation of effects\nAccuracy of strain labeling\n\nWith that caveat in mind, we analyzed our user-submitted strain reviews to find five indica strains that can defy their sedating stereotypes and offer more uplifting effects commonly associated with sativa varieties. Granted, I wouldn\u2019t expect a hyperactive burst of energy from these strains, but sativa fans can certainly appreciate the creative, focused, and social cerebral effects these five have to offer.\n\n1. Purple Chemdawg\n \nChemdawg is known for its jolt of cerebral energy, but what happens when you crossbreed it with Purple Kush? According to Leafly reviewers, that invigorating buzz remains intact but is balanced by calming body sensations that keep you relaxed while your mind takes flight.\n\n\u201cIncredibly unique strain. I\u2019ve never felt so stuck but completely awake and alert.\u201d\n2. Somango\n \nThough mostly indica, Somango has several qualities that any sativa fan can appreciate: focus, creativity, and a tropical flavor profile rarely found in indica varieties. Its Jack Herer parent is partially responsible for that extra cerebral kick, and Somango can also express high levels of CBD which lends to this strain\u2019s clear-headed effects. Somango is a great companion strain for anyone needing to keep their mind sharp while pushing out pain, inflammation, or muscle spasms.\n\n\u201cKeeps me creative, focused and full of ideas for activities like drawing, compose music, etc.\u201d\n3. Alien Dawg\n \nAs with most strains, the reported effects of Alien Dawg range from \u201cI can totally function on this\u201d to \u201cI am plastered to a couch in space.\u201d Keeping the dose moderate is the best way to bring out the balance in this strain as it gives rise to concentrated creativity and positive moods. You\u2019ll also find its cerebral-focused effects are most easily harnessed earlier in the day, while you still have energy for this indica to build off of.\n\n\u201cWorks well for anxiety but by no means was I a couch potato on it. I got energetic from it was able to get my stuff done.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is one of the few \u2018sativa\u2019 indicas in that is produces noticeable head effects while still having similar body loads of an indica.\u201d\n4. Candy Cane\n \nFor those of you looking for a creative boost without jarring cerebral activity, Christmas has come early. Candy Cane is the indica you want, offering sweet mango and citrus flavors alongside uplifting euphoria that keeps the mind agile. This strain relaxes the body without robbing you of your faculties, so staying social and productive generally isn\u2019t a problem.\n\n\u201cThe high is euphoric and uplifting. Makes me a little creative and energy high versus the couch effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cA great body high but keeps your mind racing. Overall a wonderful indica strain for sativa lovers!\u201d\n5. Power Kush\n \nThey don\u2019t call it Power Kush for nothin\u2019. This strain does pack a euphoric punch, but there\u2019s general consensus among Leafly reviewers that Power Kush won\u2019t leave you glued to the couch. The cerebral effects aren\u2019t as racy as your typical sativa; instead, they provide a calm mindset that allows you to stay focused and engaged, so long as you dose somewhat modestly.\n\n\u201cI am relaxed but not couch-locked. I can still focus and task very well. This one will be an after-I-get-home-from-work strain\u2026something to address the pain but not get me ready for bed yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a great strain for depression. I should get couch lock but I don\u2019t.\u201d",
