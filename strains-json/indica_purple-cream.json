Just found it through a local delivery service in SW Washington state (yes possession is legal here now but you still have to be medical to legally obtain it - don\u0027t say buy - buying is still illegal). I have generalized anxiety disorder. I\u0027m naturally the kind of person that freaks out after one cup of coffee. For me this is almost as good as xanax. I have a prescription for xanax and also a prescription for medical cannabis. Two bowls of Purple Cream makes me sleepier than 2 of my .5mg xanax but that\u0027s not necessarily a bad thing. It\u0027s an instant attitude adjuster that leaves me clear headed and happy and mellow. I plan to make a bunch of tincture with this for panic attacks. Whoever developed this strain - thank you. Most indicas leave me too sedated for daytime. This is perfect for a day or night 100% indica for me although for strictly nighttime I prefer G-13 as my all time favorite.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1619366,"username":"ChelseaParm","text":"Great smelling, good price, great service!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/5DsWrIpoq-56NpD59UXAqpoVN88=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fqSLuo6zNRCeIia1paBYS_wayfarers-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":68,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":27.616279069767444},{"name":"Pine","score":26.453488372093023},{"name":"Earthy","score":2.3255813953488373},{"name":"Pungent","score":2.3255813953488373},{"name":"Flowery","score":1.4534883720930232}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":84.011627906976742},{"name":"Relaxed","score":82.558139534883722},{"name":"Hungry","score":81.3953488372093},{"name":"Giggly","score":77.034883720930239},{"name":"Uplifted","score":56.395348837209305}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":9.8837209302325579},{"name":"Pain","score":6.104651162790697},{"name":"Insomnia","score":5.5232558139534884},{"name":"Depression","score":4.3604651162790695},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":2.6162790697674421}],"conditions":[{"name":"PMS","score":27.325581395348838},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":25.581395348837209},{"name":"Anxiety","score":7.55813953488372},{"name":"Migraines","score":2.9069767441860463},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.4534883720930232}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":54.360465116279073},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":4.3604651162790695},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.0348837209302326},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.4534883720930232},{"name":"Headache","score":0.872093023255814}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-cream_100x100_00a2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/600177/b/purple-cream__primary_8055.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-cream_100x100_adcb.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/490228/b/purple-cream__primary_043e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-cream_100x100_51a0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/479502/b/purple-cream__primary_418b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-cream_100x100_4b48.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/458066/b/purple-cream__primary_7232.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-cream_100x100_1871.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/415845/b/purple-cream__primary_71d2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-cream_100x100_5567.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/340077/b/purple-cream__primary_fe50.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":20,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA","Detroit, MI","Phoenix, AZ","Vancouver, BC"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/purple-cream","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.35294117647059/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
