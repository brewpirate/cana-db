            "text": "I love this stuff. Just found it through a local delivery service in SW Washington state (yes possession is legal here now but you still have to be medical to legally obtain it - don't say buy - buying is still illegal). I have generalized anxiety disorder. I'm naturally the kind of person that freaks out after one cup of coffee. For me this is almost as good as xanax. I have a prescription for xanax and also a prescription for medical cannabis. Two bowls of Purple Cream makes me sleepier than 2 of my .5mg xanax but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's an instant attitude adjuster that leaves me clear headed and happy and mellow. I plan to make a bunch of tincture with this for panic attacks. Whoever developed this strain - thank you. Most indicas leave me too sedated for daytime. This is perfect for a day or night 100% indica for me although for strictly nighttime I prefer G-13 as my all time favorite.",
