Nice crystal buds with a touch of purple. Open the jar and get smacked in the face with a pungent woody and earth smell. Burned real smooth and tasted just as it smelled with a hint of pine.

Practically cured my insomnia. The first night I smoked this I had the best sleep I’ve had in months. I woke up feeling amazing the next morning. \nI’ve been smoking this in the evening for about two weeks now and I’ve also noticed a big difference in my depression.

But I do recommend to anyone trying to relax or sleep!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/5DsWrIpoq-56NpD59UXAqpoVN88=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fqSLuo6zNRCeIia1paBYS_wayfarers-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":102,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":19.987468671679196},{"name":"Sweet","score":13.69047619047619},{"name":"Grape","score":10.651629072681704},{"name":"Pungent","score":10.432330827067668},{"name":"Woody","score":9.1165413533834574}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":30.670426065162907},{"name":"Euphoric","score":18.045112781954884},{"name":"Sleepy","score":15.883458646616543},{"name":"Happy","score":12.43734335839599},{"name":"Giggly","score":12.186716791979949}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":12.406015037593985},{"name":"Insomnia","score":9.9937343358395978},{"name":"Headaches","score":6.954887218045112},{"name":"Pain","score":5.4511278195488719},{"name":"Cramps","score":5.4197994987468672}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":9.9937343358395978},{"name":"PTSD","score":8.6779448621553872},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":8.0200501253132828},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":5.8583959899749374},{"name":"PMS","score":3.2581453634085213}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":4.7932330827067666},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":3.0388471177944862},{"name":"Headache","score":2.3809523809523809},{"name":"Paranoid","score":0.43859649122807015},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.21929824561403508}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-elephant_100x100_914d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002830/b/purple-elephant__primary_e098.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-elephant_100x100_1557.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002215/b/purple-elephant__primary_6810.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-elephant_100x100_089b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002214/b/purple-elephant__primary_e757.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-elephant_100x100_6232.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001968/b/purple-elephant__primary_5f19.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-elephant_100x100_f19f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000388/b/purple-elephant__primary_fc32.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-elephant_100x100_469c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/708079/b/purple-elephant__primary_016a.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":33,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Airway Heights, WA","Colorado Springs, CO","Detroit, MI","East Wenatchee, WA","Goldendale, WA","Longview, WA","Nelson, BC","Shelton, WA","Silverdale, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/purple-elephant","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.19607843137255/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
