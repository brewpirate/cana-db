Burned real smooth and tasted just as it smelled with a hint of pine. The high was total body that crept up real slow then hit you like a ton of bricks. Made me real giddy for the first 20 minutes of the experience then I wandered into sleep and that's where I stayed till morning.",

I woke up feeling amazing the next morning. \nI\u2019ve been smoking this in the evening for about two weeks now and I\u2019ve also noticed a big difference in my depression. Maybe it\u2019s the better sleep I\u2019m getting? Who knows. But I do recommend to anyone trying to relax or sleep!",
