I don't know what I'm thinking about before falling asleep but I don't care either!\n\nI've combusted with a spoon pipe, bong and a desktop vaporizer. I much prefer the bong with this strain and my intended outcome, everyone's tolerance and wanted results are different; but one bong bowl puts me on my ass. Opposed to the vape just relaxes me.\n\nThe dispensary budtender mentioned it tastes like a Grape Jolly Rancher, hence the name. Everyone has a different palette; but it tasted like a mix between 25% fruit 75% chemicals. I best describe it as - it tastes like purple.\n\n10/10 will smoke again.\n",
