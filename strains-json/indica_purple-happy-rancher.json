Body high is intense. It\u0027s easy to lose yourself in relaxation. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m thinking about before falling asleep but I don\u0027t care either!\n\nI\u0027ve combusted with a spoon pipe, bong and a desktop vaporizer. I much prefer the bong with this strain and my intended outcome, everyone\u0027s tolerance and wanted results are different; but one bong bowl puts me on my ass. Opposed to the vape just relaxes me.\n\nThe dispensary budtender mentioned it tastes like a Grape Jolly Rancher, hence the name. Everyone has a different palette; but it tasted like a mix between 25% fruit 75% chemicals. I best describe it as - it tastes like purple.\n\n10/10 will smoke again.\n","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"},{"id":1570877,"username":"purphaze420","text":"Nugs probly are 75% purple, 15% orange and 10% green.
