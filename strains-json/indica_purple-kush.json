Typically, this resinous flower is categorized as sativa, hybrid, or indica, based on the morphology of the plant. But cannabis can be further categorized through a vernacular defined by the popular culture, such as Kush, Haze, and Purple. These terms refer to types of cannabis characterized by distinct smells, flavors, effects, and/or geographic regions.\n\nWhat Characterizes ‘Kush’ Cannabis?\n\nKush is a particular variety of cannabis that descends from the Hindu Kush mountains. This mountain range spans the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and is one of the few geographic regions where the cannabis plant grows natively.\nHaving strong Kush genetics usually means a strain will have a few of the following attributes:\n\nAppearance: Your strain may exhibit deep green colas and leaves with hints of purple. Pistils (hairs) can look orange, bronze, or rust colored.  Buds are dense, chunky, and knotted, coming from squat, thick plants.\nSmell: Aroma can vary between earthy, floral, pungent, pine, incense, sweet fruit, hash spice, pepper, citrus, gas, and herbs.\nFlavor: Smoke or vapor should be smooth and herbaceous, tasting of flowers, grape, diesel, citrus, and earth.\nEffects: The effects are typically heavy and sedative. OG Kush crosses are usually coupled with a bright euphoria that puts a smile on the couch-locked consumer. Introspection or internal reflection is a common effect of Kush as well. These cerebral effects make a strong case for Kush as a meditative variety of cannabis.\n\nKeep in mind that these attributes can vary from Kush strain to Kush strain. How a strain is grown and its unique genetic expression (referred to as a “phenotype”) naturally affect a strain’s attributes.\n\nAmong strain breeders, Kush varieties are popular candidates for backcrossing and in turn, stabilizing hybrid genetics. As with many landrace strains, Kush genetics present natural resistance to certain elements native to their land of origin. This includes hardy stocks and vegetation that can survive colder, harsher climates and moderate water consumption, allowing the plant to endure somewhat parched terrain. In addition to their natural resilience, many growers choose to grow Kush strains for their heavy yields and manageable height.\nWhat Are the Most Popular Kush Cannabis Strains?\nA simple search of “Kush” will yield hundreds of strains with an Afghani ancestor, but let’s start with the five most popular:\n1. OG Kush\n\nThe most famous of all Kush varieties, OG Kush hits the sweet spot on the indica-dominant hybrid scale. This strain’s comfortable yet potent sedation coupled with an uplifting euphoria make it the perfect strain to just feel good with.\n2. Bubba Kush\n\nBubba Kush is what usually comes to mind when people think of indica-dominant effects. This strain is stoney and sedative, weighing the consumer to couch as though they were wearing cement boots with a matching cement tracksuit and stately cement trench coat. Bubba Kush may also ignite your appetite; just try not to fall asleep in front of the fridge while spooning a box of Eggo waffles.\n3. Purple Kush\n\nPurple Kush is an excellent example of indica-dominant attributes. This strain has purple foliage and will generally have an earthy, grapey flavor, as well as sleepy effects.\n4. Skywalker OG\n\nSkywalker OG takes the classic hybrid effects of OG Kush and deepens its sedating effects with the addition of Skywalker. This Kush develops a fruit-rich, diesel-driven flavor and aroma while mimicking the happy, uplifted mental characteristics of its paternal genetics. The creeping, sedative effects melt over the body, taking the consumer from the light side of day into the dark side of night (and sleep.)\n5. Master Kush\n\nMaster Kush is another Kush classic that inherits attributes directly from Hindu Kush. With a mixture of sleepy, happy, and relaxing effects, Master Kush earns its title. This strain is an excellent alternative to Bubba Kush.\nWhich Kush varieties are your favorite?

Leafly and Botanicare are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Purple Kush is the indica-dominant cross between Hindu Kush and Purple Afghani that is often chosen for its soothing pain relief. Leading with a pungent earthy Kush aroma, Purple Kush may also feature undertones of sweet fruit. This strain also entices consumers with a purple color that may be coerced while flowering.\nGrow Techniques: Once you have this clone-only indica in your possession, it’s a good idea to keep it as a mother plant for future use. Its bushy form makes it great for SCROG (screen of green) indoors, and its low height is perfect for limited canopy space. Purple Kush does well in a hydroponic setup, which allows it to get all the nutrients it needs to fully develop. Make sure to prune the plant and remove foliage that isn’t receiving sunlight to promote growth on top of the canopy and improve airflow. Its resinous leftover trim makes for great hash.\nFlowering Time: 7-8 weeks\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Easy to moderate\nClimate: Prefers cool to moderate temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Purple Kush does well both indoors and outdoors, given its ability to handle cooler temperatures. If grown outside, carefully monitor bud growth and moisture to prevent bud rot from occurring.\nFeeding: Feed this plant heavily throughout vegging and flowering to unlock the plant’s full potential. Kush genetics are always looking for extra food.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/27161254/purple-kush-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-purple-kush-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":1878,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":30.244021598690729},{"name":"Grape","score":24.399979542615959},{"name":"Berry","score":20.746465717731166},{"name":"Sweet","score":16.747679701968213},{"name":"Woody","score":13.910859640811406}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":86.525878590809256},{"name":"Happy","score":58.845880528877217},{"name":"Sleepy","score":58.667928205349057},{"name":"Euphoric","score":55.624125177656232},{"name":"Hungry","score":40.173847387915075}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Insomnia","score":47.220649037426242},{"name":"Stress","score":44.336144429131316},{"name":"Pain","score":35.659239200654639},{"name":"Depression","score":32.273313342521213},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":27.688840497006762}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":35.987189909126144},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":20.964740621904475},{"name":"PTSD","score":20.652200245488608},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":19.865250441448815},{"name":"Arthritis","score":15.865414638873334}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":33.271095331409619},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":19.562010099487487},{"name":"Paranoid","score":6.29055138033507},{"name":"Headache","score":5.12594749989233},{"name":"Dizzy","score":4.9592467375855982}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-kush_100x100_97f5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1003429/b/purple-kush__primary_62a5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-kush_100x100_11dc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1003428/b/purple-kush__primary_b76d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-kush_100x100_ed96.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1003427/b/purple-kush__primary_4677.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-kush_100x100_4b6d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1003426/b/purple-kush__primary_6cdf.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-kush_100x100_4e50.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001245/b/purple-kush__primary_ca62.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/purple-kush_100x100_91ed.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000174/b/purple-kush__primary_4224.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":846,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Toronto, ON","Vancouver, BC","Montréal, QC","Calgary, AB","Seattle, WA","Edmonton, AB","Ottawa, ON","Eugene, OR","Halifax, NS"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/purple-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.28274760383387/240","testGraph":"https://leafly.s3.amazonaws.com/strains/testing/0FRudDkkRoySCT4abcCg_purple-kush.png","weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Hindu Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"hindu-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush","symbol":"Hk","applink":"leafly://strain/hindu-kush"},{"name":"Purple Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"purple-afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani","symbol":"Ppa","applink":"leafly://strain/purple-afghani"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":55,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Short","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
