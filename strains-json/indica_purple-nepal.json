Opening a jar will deliver a fruit loops cereal scent lighting your eyes with her glistening frost complementing the healthy purple throughout. \nI rolled mine in a king size juicy jay, cake flavored paper. \nThis provided me with a grape pixi stix flavor which is so gentle on the in hale.. \nOnset approx 7 min.\nDeep body high, leaving your stress behind and bringing you confidence in mind. \nI felt a desire to dance to music, but settled with a tasty Redds Strawberry Ale and football. \nThis strain may be to too heavy for a noob, but the casual toker will find a settled soul at the end of the day. Great smoked along with use of your pre work out supplements before you hit the gym.\n\nThe Casual Connoisseur\n-BadFish Slims",
