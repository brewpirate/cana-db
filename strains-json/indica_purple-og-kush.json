Purple OG Kush may cause you to feel sleepy, cloudy, and unfocused, making this strain perfect for nighttime use.

This strain smelled wonderful, tasted great and was a beautiful smoking experience, but I did not feel relaxed or tired. Instead, I felt energetic, focused and productive. I smoked this right before bed and stayed up for 2 hours doing \"work\" on my computer.  I actually had to smoke some kosher kush in order to finally get to sleep.",
