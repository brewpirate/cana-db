            "text": "Purple punch my oh my what a strain! This is indica on steroids. Purple punch does exactly what it\u2019s name says it\u2019s a punch of some heavy indica straight to your soul. Depending on the dose you can have a nice mellow focused high and giggle or you could really lose your mind and get faded. This is serious relaxation medicine helps feel stressed free. As expected from a heavy indica you will feel the urge to nap or sleep. Smoke taste was pleasant but it does hit hard while producing thick white clouds of smoke. It\u2019s one of those strains that you can\u2019t get a big hits unless you want to choke mid hit. Smell was like grape soda and the bud was ridiculously covered in trichomes. Woke up every morning feeling refreshed, I would recommend this for midday or night use for the relaxation purposes and nap inducing high.  This won\u2019t get you blitzed like a strong hybrid, but if you like indicas this is a must try",
