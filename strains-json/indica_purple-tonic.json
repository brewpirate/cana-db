Taste didn\u2019t linger too long. Total creeper, got stuck on stupid for a min. After that I felt very relaxed, no pain.  Kind of tingly. Didn't  feel too social, would rather chill with 1 or 2 friends or alone and listen to music or watch a movie..\r\nI felt pretty euphoric, things seemed to \u201cpop\u201d a little more.  1 dimensional objects look a little more 3D. I felt pretty creative, like I want to write or paint. At about 20min in I was really feeling it all over. Eyes were hella heavy, body totally relaxed, mind totally out of it. Munchies a little bit. Started getting pretty sleep and ready for bed at around 45min. Passed out as soon as my head hit the pillow. Slept great all through the night, didn\u2019t wake up once. Perfect night time med.\r\n",
