            "text": "Environment and genetics both play a role in the coloration of a plant. But what exactly causes each variety to look the way it does? What gives Black Cherry Soda its otherworldly color of dark purple with vibrant orange hairs cutting through it like streaks of fire? Today we\u2019ll explore the color of cannabis, examining which factors influence its coloration, why some strains are more vibrant than others, and whether purple = potent.\nHow Do Genetics Influence Cannabis\u2019s Color?\nIn order for plants to express vibrant non-green hues, they may need the genetic building blocks to do so. These building blocks are called anthocyanins, which are a family of flavonoids that provide purple, red, or blue pigments (also found in blueberries, eggplants, red cabbage, concord grapes, violets, and other richly-colored plants). Some cannabis strains naturally contain higher levels of anthocyanins than others. Ever notice some of your favorite strains tend to express the same colors over and over again? Granddaddy Purple, for example, seems to always carry swirls of deep purples and pastel lavenders. This alternative coloration is indicative of the strain\u2019s predisposition to high anthocyanin levels, and it\u2019s certainly a quality some cannabis breeders attempt to select for and coerce, if only to make us consumers ooh-and-ahh over pretty colors (hence the long line of \u201cpurple\u201d strains that includes Purple Kush, Mendocino Purps, Purple Urkle, and many others).\n\nWhich Cannabis Strains Tend to Turn Purple, Blue, and Red?\nThere are many strains that contain a genetic predisposition for high anthocyanin levels, and you\u2019ll often find them under monikers that begin with colors like purple, red, blue, or pink. No, this doesn\u2019t mean these strains will always show off fancy hues, but they have a higher potential of doing so if conditions are right.\nPlants with low anthocyanin may produce a different array of colors in the final weeks of flowering, due to another family of molecules called carotenoids. These are responsible for the earthy gold and yellow hues buds can take on before harvest as chlorophyll shuts off.\n\nHow Does Cannabis Go from Green to Purple?\nAs you might remember from your elementary biology classes, chlorophyll is what gives plants its green color. Chlorophyll is vitally important to the photosynthesis process by which plants absorb sunlight for energy. As cannabis plants mature, they produce less of the dominant pigment chlorophyll and we begin to see those anthocyanins emerge in a show of purples, reds, and blues. Growers should note that there are specific environmental conditions that trigger the halt of chlorophyll production. We\u2019ll get into that shortly.\n\nWhat Other Environmental Factors Affect Cannabis\u2019s Color?\nAlthough not all cannabis strains will express purple, blue, or red hues in their lifetime, those equipped with the right genetics may do so under certain environmental conditions. The reason why cannabis produces flavonoids and anthocyanin, researchers have observed, is for protection. \u201cFlavonoid accumulation [is] involved in many aspects of plant growth,\u201d the study authors wrote, \u201cincluding pathogen resistance, pigment production, and protection against ultraviolet radiation, which contributes to the growth of pollen and seed coat development.\u201d\nInformation on anthocyanin production in cannabis is limited. What we do know comes largely from cannabis cultivation experience and studies measuring patterns of anthocyanin production in other vegetation.\nFirst, there\u2019s temperature. Purple, red, and blue hues may appear in response to drops in temperature, since chlorophyll production takes its natural pause in autumn as the days become colder. Research on other fruits and flowers noted that higher temperatures destroy anthocyanin production. That same study also found that higher pH levels lead to the destruction of anthocyanin pigments, meaning they tend to thrive in more acidic environments.\n\nThe pH level determines which pigment the plant takes on:\n\nAcidic environments tend to induce red and pink coloration\nPurple coloration occurs in neutral pH environments\nBlues become present with higher pH levels\nYellow is developed in alkaline conditions\n\nAre Purple Cannabis Strains More Potent?\nThey might be more eye-catching, but purple strains are not necessarily more potent than their green relatives. A purple-blossomed plant exposed to cold temperature may actually produce less THC, so it\u2019s important to keep in mind \u2013 as Robert Clarke aptly puts it in The Cannabible \u2013 that \u201cmany traits prove to be desirable only in certain varieties under certain conditions.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear your experiences with purple cannabis. Have you noticed any consistencies in its flavor or effects? Have you ever tried growing a purple variety? What\u2019s the most vibrant strain you\u2019ve ever seen?",

Leafly and\u00a0General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Purple Urkle is a sweet, fruity indica strain that can offer relief from pain, headaches, and insomnia. Its origins are unknown, but some believe Purple Urkle to be a descendent of Mendocino Purps.\nGrow Techniques: With hydroponics, Purple Urkle will produce plentiful and wide bud sites. The SCROG (screen of green) method works wonders, but simply topping and trellising can also result in a great crop.\nFlowering Time: 8-9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Hard\nClimate: Grows best if kept between 72-80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Grows well indoors or outdoors. Purple Urkle needs warmer weather to finish and put on its full weight.\nFeeding: A difficult strain to feed, Purple Urkle is picky about what nutrients it needs, especially when flowering. At that point, amend soils or bump up the feeding to help the plant take off.",

I am emaciated, skin and bones ... 115 pounds! I literally thought that I was dying! I heard from another patient that it helped her so much, she gained 15 pounds in two weeks. The doctors have given me everything they have for nausea, vomiting, heartburn and abdominal pain. Not one worked! I tried this THC capsule and within 90 mins, I have no heartburn, headaches, no nausea or vomiting, and I am hungry. I am putting on some weight now and I am happy! I can go out to restaurants and not fear vomiting in public. I feel normal again! I take up to three capsules a hour before eating. It makes me burp a lot! I am just so happy to being able to eat again! I have not vomited once while taking these capsules! I have tried EVERYTHING, including wax, with no relief! I fear the day that the dispensary runs out of them! I should mention that these capsules are $24.00 a pill. Pretty expensive habit. Up to $100.00 a day, but how much would you pay to feel normal again and have your life back?",
