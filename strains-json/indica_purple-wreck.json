It\u0027s a cross between Purple Urkle X Trainwreck, a little bit will keep you going but a lot will incapacitate you. This is a very strong strain that can be excellent for day or night use. With almost instant effects behind the eyes and in the temples, Purple Wreck works beautifully for relieving headaches as well as sinus and ocular pressure, but it is not for the faint-of-heart. The Purple Urkle heritage provides a heavy-narcotic like sedation, which is crossed with Trainwreck - an \u0027uppity\u0027 daytime - sativa strain. These two strains mixed together make the perfect combination for an awesome hybrid.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/5DsWrIpoq-56NpD59UXAqpoVN88=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fqSLuo6zNRCeIia1paBYS_wayfarers-purple.png"},{"id":1624869,"username":"vitormolica","text":"Just peace inside me!
