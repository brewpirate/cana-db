Check the links below, and don't forget to leave a review if you're able to get your hands on it!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Gremlin\n\nA cross between King Louis XIII and Mogwai (White Fire Alien OG and \u201909 Cookies crossed with a secret strain), Gremlin is a hybrid strain that carries the sweet scent of cookie dough and earthy pine. Heavy-handed euphoria and physical relief melts through the body, dulling pain and insomnia while sharpening the appetite.\n\nGremlin is currently available at Green Life Cannabis in Wenatchee, WA\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Purple Cotton Candy\n\nPurple Cotton Candy by LivWell is a calming indica-dominant hybrid strain that crosses Granddaddy Purple and Cotton Candy Kush.

Tree of Life\n\nTree of Life is a unique hybrid cross between Trainwreck and Mendocino Purps, created by Oregon OMMP growers in the late 2000s. It\u2019s known to provide calming euphoria and an uplifting boost of creativity. With a vigorous sativa-dominant growth pattern, Tree of Life produces fully ripened buds with a rich palate of creamy orange zest and lemon balm. An early flowerer, Tree of Life will finish its maturation cycle by the third week of September outdoors. When consumed, Tree of Life has a pleasant taste reminiscent of sandalwood incense.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Tree of Life\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Limon\n\nCreated by LivWell, Limon is a sativa-dominant strain that blends Sour Diesel, Strawberry Diesel, and NYC Diesel. With notes of diesel and skunk in flavor, these bright green frosty buds will leave you with an uplifting and long-lasting cerebral buzz.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Limon\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Good Medicine\n\nThe name says it all with this CBD rich strain. Bred by CBD specialist Bodhi, Good Medicine crosses a Green Crack and Tres Dawg hybrid with the high-CBD Harlequin sativa. Offering sweet flavors of mango and candy followed by a mellow and relaxing high, Good Medicine is great for solving medical needs without keeping you on the couch.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Good Medicine\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Qush\n\nQush is a 70/30 indica-dominant cannabis strain from TGA Genetics, who combines Pre-98 Bubba Kush with Space Queen. Bred for potency as well as flavor, Qush\u2019s resin-packed buds radiate with sweet aromas of grape, cherry, and hashy spice. This tranquilizing strain has a way of calming worries and upset stomachs, but keep in mind that Qush can have a sedating, cloudy effect on the mind so consider saving this one for evenings and lazy days.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Qush\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Alien Inferno\n\nUsing a White Fire #6 and Alien OG hybrid and crossing it again with Diablo, LivWell created Alien Inferno. Rock solid buds slathered in trichomes and red pistils, Alien Inferno is a heavy-handed OG hybrid that can help relieve pain, boost creativity, and help you unwind. With the taste of earth, pine, and lemon, this potent indica-dominant hybrid will take care of even the most experienced connoisseur.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Alien Inferno\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",
