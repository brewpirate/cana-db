They then backcrossed the resulting plant with Ghost OG, and then crossed that with the Florida clone-only strain <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/triangle-kush\">Triangle Kush</a>. Rare Dankness #1 is the prized male selected from this endeavor, bringing heavy resin production, Chem-style growth, and a bit of OG flavor to whatever strain it pollinates. It has been used in the breeding of many of RD&rsquo;s prized hybrids, including <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/scotts-og\">Scott&rsquo;s OG</a>, <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/501st-og\">501st OG</a>, Commerce City Kush, <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/rare-darkness\">Rare Darkness</a>, and many others. &nbsp;</p>\n",

Within a few minutes I was slammed with a heavy duty floaty overall body high.  30 Minutes later it really kicked in...but allowed me to remain clear thinking the whole time.  Definitely a potent strain for when you have no driving or serious work to do.  No couch lock, no anxiety or paranoia...just absolutely relaxed with no thoughts of pain.",
