Multiple nights in a row I've fallen asleep with my shoes on to wake up around 6 hours later like 'wtf happened?!?'  There's little to no head high with this but the body buzz is pretty incredible and it hits you almost instantly.  There's also this nice earthy, sweet flavor similar to Norther Lights.  9/10",

            "text": "Recon was a pleasure for me to vaporize. It is quite the indica hybrid strain with great flavors to accompany its intense array of healing feelings. After vaporizing this strain I felt tingling from head to toe with waves of cresting euphoria coming over my body and mind. My stress from the day melted away and my physical fatigue was quelled after a long work day and workout. It is great for pain relief without making you too tired. \n   Recon is a fun strain that would be good for movie going, fine dining, or at the breaking point for a hike. Pairing it with caffeine, black tea in my case, is great for keeping that energy up and giving the high a very focused feeling.",
