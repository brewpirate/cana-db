            "text": "Really enjoyed this strain. Got a very long bud today and decided to smoke it. First off, this bud was nice and soft to the touch, not wet, but perfectly cure. So many trichomes it shone in the light of my friend's basement. Then there were these beautiful, Blood Orange hairs that covered the bud so perfectly. It was almost as if it were a symmetrical creation. I also noticed on some spots on the bud, were light tints of blue. Smells of potent, yet fruity musk filled my nose.  Definitely after the first bole, I felt very focused and talkative. My friends, Girlfriend and I were talking for some time, give or take a good half an hour. We then smoked a full-face gas mask, keeping up conversation. After just two good tokes each, we were floating into euphoria about 10 minutes in, and that's when the couch-lock occurred. Talking still, we enjoyed our company as we lightly socialized with fantastic music as background noise. Approximately an hour and a half later, we smoked one more bole and the euphoria over time then turned into a lazy existence.  Just got home now to write this review, about a half an hour after the last bole smoked to feel like my bed is the most comfortable thing in the universe. Wonderful Strain for chilling with friends after a long day. I certainly give it a 9.5 and will look for it again.",
