I picked this strain up from my ld when I asked the bud tender to recommend a energetic hybrid. Let me say \"wow\". This bud is awesome if you need to get things done while enjoying a balanced head and body high. I found that if you add one or two more hits than normal you get an incredible pulsing from head to toe! I am adding this to my list of go to day strains. Don\u0027t pass this one up if you find it in stock.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1580803,"username":"skyraines","text":"Herr comes the BOOM ready or not.\nI picked up a half gram of Rocklock by Venom Extracts.\nIt\u0027s the perfect indica for chillin, there\u0027s no sedation.\nThe feeling is slight and my first go around with this strain was flower.
