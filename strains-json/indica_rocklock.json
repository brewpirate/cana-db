The smell of this herb is sweet and fruity. The stone is surprisingly stimulating given that it is primary an indica strain; which has some rather nice advantages when going out to a concert for example.

I picked this strain up from my ld when I asked the bud tender to recommend a energetic hybrid. Let me say \"wow\". This bud is awesome if you need to get things done while enjoying a balanced head and body high. I found that if you add one or two more hits than normal you get an incredible pulsing from head to toe! I am adding this to my list of go to day strains. Don't pass this one up if you find it in stock.",

Now that I have it in shatter the feeling comes out strong.\n\nAlso great for relieving depression I have just buried someone close to me & haven't been able to snap out of heavy mourning. Now I feel at peace my loved ones no longer suffering, the world seems a little brighter with this strain.\n\nI haven't had the opportunity to go to a concert on this strain, but it seems like the perfect activity for this strain.",
