Not the smartest idea to take my portable vaporizer loaded up with this particular strain to a bowling alley. Needless to say, I quickly lost interest in the repetitiveness of throwing a heavy ball down a strip of greased flooring.

In honor of Canada Day and the promising strides the country has made towards nationwide legalization, here are 11 strains with Canadian roots. Pick one up and raise a joint to celebrate the friendly Canucks up north!\n \n  Manitoba Poison\nThe Manitoba province is located at the longitudinal center of Canada, so it\u0027s only fitting that Manitoba Poison is a 50/50 hybrid (though you\u0027ll likely feel the heavy indica properties pretty quickly).\n  Sweet Tooth\nAn oldie but a goodie, Sweet Tooth won 1st Place in the 2001 High Times Cannabis Cup.\n  Mendocino Purps\nMendocino Purps, or simply \"The Purps,\" is one of a few living legends that made this list. Handed off as a clone-only cut, this plant was stabilized by BC Bud Depot and has since made its way around the world. \n  Chemo\nChemo, or UBC Chemo, is named for the university where the strain was allegedly created and for its supplementary effects on patients going through chemotherapy. This strain is an international treasure with origins that reach back to the 1970s.\n  M-39\nThe clever astronomical designation of M-39 speaks to the Northern Light #5 portion of this cross. \n  God Bud\nGod Bud is some of the finest around. This incredible indica-dominant strain lives in the pantheon of cannabis deities, but like many of the old gods, this strain is the primogenitor to many other floral demigods like Blue God and Grape God.\n  DJ Short Blueberry\nDJ Short is one of the principal breeders in the cannabis industry. With cuts like Juicy Fruit and Flo, he\u0027s left a lasting mark on the cannabis industry with exotic genetic crosses cultivated through a life of world travel and reverence for this resinous flower. DJ Short Blueberry is known as THE west coast Blueberry phenotype.\n  Blue Dynamite\nBlue Dynamite was featured as one of the top 10 strains of 2007 in High Times magazine. \n  Island Sweet Skunk\nBred by Federation Seed Company in Canada, this beautiful blend of strong landrace genetics offers a smoke that is stimulating and versatile. Known for creating considerable amounts of tertiary CBD, Island Sweet Skunk invigorates the user while still offering anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.\n  Lowryder\nLowryder is a squat and resilient plant that is ideal for outdoor grows in less than pleasant climates, making it a seasoned fit for Canadians seeking a plant that could grow and hide in plain sight while weathering a rugged season. \n  Romulan\nRomulan is a space-age indica sent to Earth to expand our mind. And with Canada\u0027s savvy immigration policy, it\u0027s no wonder this heady smoker stopped there first.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12001518/cannabis-strains-with-canadian-roots.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/cannabis-strains-with-canadian-roots"},{"id":"contentitems-36065","title":"Tips for Growing Romulan Cannabis","author":"Leafly Staff","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1501547576000)\/","text":"Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Romulan is a classic British Columbia strain thought to be a cross between White Rhino and a North American indica. It’s held its own among other popular strains as a heavy indica with medical benefits for pain management. Along with its exceptional euphoric high, Romulan has a distinct pine smell with sweet overtones.\nGrow Techniques: Healthy soils bring out Romulan’s pungent pine smell. Grow indoors or outdoors, and expect to train the plant to increase its yield. It grows bushy and short in stature, making it great for training techniques such as SOG (sea of green) or SCROG (screen of green). Ensure enough spacing between your plants for airflow, which helps prevent mold and pest damage. \nFlowering Time: 8 weeks \nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: This strain succeeds in colder climates more than most, but prefers a temperature between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Be wary of high moisture levels with the dense indica buds.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Romulan is suitable for indoors or out, but a dry climate is ideal outdoors.\nFeeding: Heavy feeding is best. Maintain the plant’s immune system by diversifying its nutrient sources and using compost tea.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/31172634/romulan-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-romulan-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":723,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":18.919872756842022},{"name":"Pungent","score":11.319702796836719},{"name":"Citrus","score":9.9156132868938833},{"name":"Pine","score":8.9627292017114648},{"name":"Berry","score":7.6167907921462419}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":97.422287794289076},{"name":"Sleepy","score":72.074864415889},{"name":"Euphoric","score":52.292366108509171},{"name":"Happy","score":48.271913323887233},{"name":"Hungry","score":43.660177707668794}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":58.16732859167022},{"name":"Pain","score":42.36484340645918},{"name":"Depression","score":37.019784461397791},{"name":"Insomnia","score":35.404422799070275},{"name":"Headaches","score":26.453908382134308}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":40.254564839567529},{"name":"PTSD","score":22.359817895008693},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":17.514692641115662},{"name":"Multiple Sclerosis","score":15.275111852529157},{"name":"Phantom Limb Pain","score":15.038145027884607}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":30.351951573613274},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":21.258829544423428},{"name":"Dizzy","score":11.319702796836719},{"name":"Paranoid","score":8.2980704129993228},{"name":"Headache","score":2.5831216103972245}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/indica/romulan/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/indica/romulan/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/romulan_100x100_d105.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/624493/b/romulan__primary_1ae8.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/romulan_100x100_af7c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/609138/b/romulan__primary_c18a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/romulan_100x100_dd3a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/543999/b/romulan__primary_a3a3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/romulan_100x100_92fb.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/516138/b/romulan__primary_6d2f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/romulan_100x100_6c77.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494870/b/romulan__primary_d618.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/romulan_100x100_f619.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494158/b/romulan__primary_a969.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":126,"popularCities":["Toronto, ON","Vancouver, BC","Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Portland, OR","Edmonton, AB","Seattle, WA","Victoria, BC","Winnipeg, MB","Halifax, NS"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/romulan","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.23928077455048/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"North American Indica","subtitle":null,"slug":"north-american","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/north-american","symbol":"Nam","applink":"leafly://strain/north-american"},{"name":"White Rhino","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-rhino","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/white-rhino","symbol":"Wr","applink":"leafly://strain/white-rhino"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Moderate","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":56,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tAroma is best brought out when grown outdoors with organic fertilizers\n\tSuitable for sea of green (SOG) method\n\n"}}
