            "text": "\u00a0\nDid you know that many beloved cannabis strains hail from the United States' northern neighbors? In honor of Canada Day and the promising strides the country has made towards nationwide legalization, here are 11 strains with Canadian roots. Pick one up and raise a joint to celebrate the friendly Canucks up north!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Manitoba Poison\nThe Manitoba province is located at the longitudinal center of Canada, so it's only fitting that Manitoba Poison is a 50/50 hybrid (though you'll likely feel the heavy indica properties pretty quickly).\n\u00a0\u00a0Sweet Tooth\nAn oldie but a goodie, Sweet Tooth won 1st Place in the 2001 High Times Cannabis Cup.\n\u00a0\u00a0Mendocino Purps\nMendocino Purps, or simply \"The Purps,\" is one of a few living legends that made this list. Handed off as a clone-only cut, this plant was stabilized by BC Bud Depot and has since made its way around the world.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Chemo\nChemo, or UBC Chemo, is named for the university where the strain was allegedly created and for its supplementary effects on patients going through chemotherapy. This strain is an international treasure with origins that reach back to the 1970s.\n\u00a0\u00a0M-39\nThe clever astronomical designation of M-39 speaks to the Northern Light #5 portion of this cross.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0God Bud\nGod Bud is some of the finest around. This incredible indica-dominant strain lives in the pantheon of cannabis deities, but like many of the old gods, this strain is the primogenitor to many other floral demigods like Blue God and Grape God.\n\u00a0\u00a0DJ Short Blueberry\nDJ Short is one of the principal breeders in the cannabis industry. With cuts like Juicy Fruit and Flo, he's left a lasting mark on the cannabis industry with exotic genetic crosses cultivated through a life of world travel and reverence for this resinous flower. DJ Short Blueberry is known as THE west coast Blueberry phenotype.\n\u00a0\u00a0Blue Dynamite\nBlue Dynamite was featured as one of the top 10 strains of 2007 in High Times magazine.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Island Sweet Skunk\nBred by Federation Seed Company in Canada, this beautiful blend of strong landrace genetics offers a smoke that is stimulating and versatile. Known for creating considerable amounts of tertiary CBD, Island Sweet Skunk invigorates the user while still offering anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.\n\u00a0\u00a0Lowryder\nLowryder is a squat and resilient plant that is ideal for outdoor grows in less than pleasant climates, making it a seasoned fit for Canadians seeking a plant that could grow and hide in plain sight while weathering a rugged season.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Romulan\nRomulan is a space-age indica sent to Earth to expand our mind. And with Canada's savvy immigration policy, it's no wonder this heady smoker stopped there first.",

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Romulan is a classic British Columbia strain thought to be a cross between White Rhino and a North American indica. It\u2019s held its own among other popular strains as a heavy indica with medical benefits for pain management. Along with its exceptional euphoric high, Romulan has a distinct pine smell with sweet overtones.\nGrow Techniques: Healthy soils bring out Romulan\u2019s pungent pine smell. Grow indoors or outdoors, and expect to train the plant to increase its yield. It grows bushy and short in stature, making it great for training techniques such as SOG (sea of green) or SCROG (screen of green). Ensure enough spacing between your plants for airflow, which helps prevent mold and pest damage.\u00a0\nFlowering Time: 8 weeks\u00a0\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: This strain succeeds in colder climates more than most, but prefers a temperature between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Be wary of high moisture levels with the dense indica buds.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Romulan is suitable for indoors or out, but a dry climate is ideal outdoors.\nFeeding: Heavy feeding is best. Maintain the plant\u2019s immune system by diversifying its nutrient sources and using compost tea.",

Needless to say, I quickly lost interest in the repetitiveness of throwing a heavy ball down a strip of greased flooring. It was one of those midnight bowling situations where they turn the lights down...I simply felt the need to just put on my sunglasses anyway and observe this strange event of black lights, neon colors, and top 40 pop hits from a seated position for the rest of the night.",
