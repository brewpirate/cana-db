            "text": "New strains have been added to Leafly's strain Explorer, and we're curious to see if any of you have tried them! Head to their strain pages to leave a strain review or find out which nearby shops carry the variety you're looking for.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Blue Alien\n\nBlue Alien is a powerful, sweet-smelling indica stain that combines genetics from Blueberry and Alien Kush. Like most Blueberry hybrids, Blue Alien takes on a sweet berry aroma that introduces its dreamy euphoria and full-body calm. Because its effects tend toward the sleepier side of the spectrum, most consumers prefer Blue Alien in the evening and when pursuing a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\nBlue Alien is currently available at BotanaCare Medical & Recreational (Northglenn, CO).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Cindy White\n\nCindy White is a sativa-dominant hybrid cross between Cinderella 99 and White Widow with uplifting effects that are ushered in by an earthy, floral aroma. With a heavy resin potentially inherited from her White Widow parent, Cindy White has a potency that won her 1st place in the 2015 High Times Cannabis Cup in the \u201cPeople\u2019s Choice\u201d category.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Pineapple Haze\n\nPineapple Haze combines the tropical aroma of Pineapple with the racing cerebral energy of Haze, creating a mostly sativa strain with equally enticing flavors and effects. Its tall plants bloom with large colas that look and smell much like pineapples. The Haze influence leads the charge when it comes to Pineapple Haze\u2019s effects, lending a creative and energetic spark that can be harnessed day or night.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Satellite OG\n\nBred by Satellite, Satellite OG is an indica-dominant cross between OG Kush and SFV OG. Satellite OG captures the heavy, long-lasting euphoria typical of OG heritage, but despite its strong indica influence, this strain delivers buzzing cerebral energy that keeps creativity sharp. A pungent skunky aroma bursts from the kief-caked buds, but the smell translates on the exhale to sweet candy and invigorating pine. Like a satellite ascending into the cosmos, Satellite OG weightlessly elevates the mood and the mind to a place where happiness meets total relaxation.\n\nSatellite OG is currently available at Compassion Union Inc.\u00a0(Los Angeles, CA).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Lamborghini\n\nLamborghini, or just Lambo, is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain that combines the upbeat, high-energy Lamb\u2019s Bread with the relaxing and blissful qualities of Holy Grail Kush. This strain inherits a complex flavor profile that begins with a sharp piney inhale and ends with a sour lime exhale. Its large buds bloom with a sticky coat of crystal trichomes in a show of Lambo\u2019s potency.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Ray Charles\n\nRay Charles is a potent indica strain named in honor of the cannabis-friendly blues musician and songwriter. This hard-hitter introduces itself with an earthy, skunky aroma that reveals itself strongest on the exhale. The full-body effects hit with intense sedation and lull you into rest and relaxation like the sweet voice of The Genius himself. For this reason, Ray Charles is best reserved for bedtime or late-night unwinding.\n\nRay Charles (the strain, obviously) is currently available at CG Corrigan (Placitas, NM) and Peaceful Herbs (Trinidad, CO).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Kuchi\n\nKuchi is a hybrid bred by Devil\u2019s Harvest Seed Company. It combines Exodus Cheese and SFV OG Kush to produce a sweet, tangy fruit flavor with a piney note from the Kush influence. Though balanced between relaxing indica and uplifting sativa genetics, the indica punch often shines through thanks to the influence of SFV OG Kush\u2019s potent pain-fighting effects.\n\nKuchi is currently available at The Herb Center (Bend, OR).",
