During my run, I was listening to an audiobook called Affirmations of a Millionaire Entrepreneur that I purchased from MaveriqsAcademy.com. And let me tell you, my high was digesting the information from the audio literature. My workout was feeling good. My mind was like a learning tunnel gobbling the information: focused, determined to learn, hungry for more knowledge. Have you seen the movie \"Limitless\" where Brad Cooper is the main cast? Think of the pill that he took to get smarter; well this strain is a perfect brain supplement alternative. Try it for yourself! Take a hit of this strain, go for a run, and listen to a motivational audio material - Experience the mind blowing experience and new awareness!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1524016,"username":"raven1313","text":"definitely a great indica. very mellowing strain. but uplifting.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":17,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":20.114942528735629},{"name":"Blueberry","score":17.528735632183906},{"name":"Pungent","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Flowery","score":3.4482758620689653},{"name":"Berry","score":1.7241379310344827}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":43.678160919540225},{"name":"Uplifted","score":39.367816091954019},{"name":"Relaxed","score":23.563218390804593},{"name":"Happy","score":22.701149425287355},{"name":"Giggly","score":20.114942528735629}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":6.8965517241379306},{"name":"Insomnia","score":5.1724137931034484},{"name":"Stress","score":5.1724137931034484},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":2.5862068965517242},{"name":"Depression","score":1.7241379310344827}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":5.1724137931034484},{"name":"Migraines","score":4.3103448275862073},{"name":"PTSD","score":2.5862068965517242},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.7241379310344827},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":1.7241379310344827}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":6.0344827586206895},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":4.3103448275862073},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.86206896551724133},{"name":"Paranoid","score":0.86206896551724133},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.86206896551724133}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/seattle-blue_100x100_96c0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/428117/b/seattle-blue__primary_a582.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/seattle-blue_100x100_d310.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/58514/b/seattle-blue_825x550_728b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/seattle-blue_100x100_10fd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/55187/b/seattle-blue_825x550_1f46.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/seattle-blue_100x100_glzatoin.gfs.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/13610/b/seattle-blue_825x550_xin4axeh.fj0.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":4,"popularCities":["Vancouver, BC","Victoria, BC"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/seattle-blue","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.52941176470588/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
