            "text": "You asked and we listened!\u00a0Here we have\u00a0five highlighted new strains of the week selected by you.\u00a0We need your help filling these strain pages with reviews, so if you've tried one of the strains below, we encourage you to share your experience with the rest of us!\nNone of these look familiar to you? Worry not, there are plenty of\u00a0other new varieties\u00a0waiting!\n\u00a0 \u00a01. Sensi Skunk\nCharacteristics of Sensi Skunk:\n\nSensi Skunk from Sensi Seeds is a potent\u00a0Skunk #1\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that offers a\u00a0sweet and citrus\u00a0flavor in contrast with the\u00a0earthy,\u00a0herbal\u00a0aroma typical of Skunk varieties. The\u00a0indica-driven effects produce a calm and\u00a0euphoric\u00a0buzz that\u00a0relaxes\u00a0tense muscles and alleviates\u00a0stress. A great choice for indoor gardeners, Sensi Skunk boasts a short flowering cycle with heavy yields. Sensi Seeds has also released feminized and auto-flowering versions for those looking to streamline the cultivation process.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a02. Dirty Girl\nCharacteristics of Dirty Girl:\n\nDirty Girl is a\u00a0sativa-dominant cross of a\u00a0Trainwreck\u00a0hybrid, known as Arcata Lemon Wreck, and\u00a0Cinderella\u00a099. The combination produces a\u00a0tropical\u00a0aroma of\u00a0pineapples, citrus, and\u00a0fruit, with a sharp\u00a0pungent\u00a0note reminiscent of Pine Sol.\u00a0The flavor of Dirty Girl is like\u00a0sweet\u00a0lemon\u00a0candy and the effects it produces are\u00a0happy\u00a0and\u00a0creative. Dirty Girl will elevate your mood and help avoid the complications of\u00a0depression,\u00a0anxiety, and\u00a0migraines\u00a0/ headaches.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a03. Game Changer\nCharacteristics of Game Changer:\n\nThe 60/40\u00a0indica-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0Game Changer is a clone-only strain plausibly named for its ability to pivot bad moods, aches, and pains. It descends from California\u2019s\u00a0Purple Dragon\u00a0and Thailand\u2019s\u00a0landrace\u00a0sativa known as Green\u00a0Thai, and this genetic fusion is evident in Game Changer\u2019s twisting hues of vibrant green and deep purple.\u00a0Floral\u00a0notes sit quietly under a loud aroma of\u00a0tropical fruit\u00a0and\u00a0grape\u00a0in a show of this hybrid\u2019s complex\u00a0terpene\u00a0profile. Whether it\u2019s day or night, Game Changer offers unencumbered\u00a0euphoria\u00a0perfect for those looking to ease into the cannabis waters.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a04. Blue Monster\nCharacteristics of Blue Monster:\n\nBlue Monster is a powerful combination of\u00a0G13,\u00a0Blueberry,\u00a0Northern Lights #5, and a\u00a0Mexican\u00a0landrace\u00a0strain. Bred by Goldenseed, Blue Monster combines a\u00a0sweet\u00a0mix of flavors with strong\u00a0indica\u00a0effects. Its complex aroma of\u00a0berries\u00a0and\u00a0tropical\u00a0fruits\u00a0exposes the influence of Blueberry and G13 genetics. When grown to its full potential, the forceful\u00a0relaxation\u00a0of Blue Monster can overwhelm novices with its immediate body sedation and commanding cerebral effects. This monster indica is sure to scare away\u00a0sleepless nights\u00a0and body\u00a0pains.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. White Diesel\nCharacteristics of White Diesel:\n\nWhite Diesel is a\u00a0sativa-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that mixes the resinous\u00a0White Widow\u00a0with the\u00a0pungent\u00a0flavors of\u00a0NYC Diesel. The buds from White Diesel produce a zesty combination of\u00a0lemon,\u00a0grapefruit, and the\u00a0diesel\u00a0fumes that we\u2019ve come to expect from\u00a0Sour Diesel\u00a0varieties. The effects are a well-rounded mix of an\u00a0uplifting\u00a0sativa head buzz with mellow body\u00a0relaxation. Medical patients enjoy White Diesel\u2019s ability to ward off\u00a0anxiety\u00a0and\u00a0depression, and for combating\u00a0migraines\u00a0and\u00a0gastrointestinal disorders.",

High aside, the citrusy-lemon taste smacks you straight up in the cheeks and face, but is balanced nicely with its earthy undertones. By the time you realize the harmony, you\u2019re forced to acknowledge the grip it has on you; like the undertow of a current. It\u2019ll make you wanna dive right into whatever form of experiences you love getting lost in. For me, that\u2019s music, cinema, and games. \n\nYou\u2019ll be drawn in.",
