Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: A classic indica bred by Paradise Seeds, Sensi Star has been around for decades and continues to hold its own amongst today\u2019s many popular strains. Sensi Star is known for its powerful high as well as also being a heavy yielder that consistently produces buds blanketed in resin.\nGrow Techniques: Paradise Seeds celebrates this strain\u2019s ability to be grown indoors or outdoors successfully. They also note that growing hydroponically or in soil works well. Indoors, you can maximize the yield by using SOG (sea of green) or SCROG (screen of green) methods. Promote bushy growth by topping the plants while they are in vegetative growth. The buds produced are very dense, so keep them away from excess moisture to prevent mold.\nFlowering Time: 8 to 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Sensi Star likes a controlled, drier climate with temperatures between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Grows well indoors or outdoors.\nFeeding: Feed this strain with a normal feeding regimen to achieve quality results.",

I suffer from a rare condition that causes me to feel stress at extreme levels that are unbearable (The type of anxiety that is so bad you'd ask for assisted suicide). Smoking Sensi-Star puts me in a state where my anxiety is literally at 0.00/10 for 2 to 3 days after smoking a small sized joint of it. My anxiety can be at 10/10 for weeks in a row. When I smoke a single joint of Sensi-Star, my anxiety falls to nothing. My mind hits pure quietness. Sensi-Star gives me that vacation I always wanted. You should actively be searching for it.",
