Leafly and General Hydroponics are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: A classic indica bred by Paradise Seeds, Sensi Star has been around for decades and continues to hold its own amongst today’s many popular strains. Sensi Star is known for its powerful high as well as also being a heavy yielder that consistently produces buds blanketed in resin.\nGrow Techniques: Paradise Seeds celebrates this strain’s ability to be grown indoors or outdoors successfully. They also note that growing hydroponically or in soil works well. Indoors, you can maximize the yield by using SOG (sea of green) or SCROG (screen of green) methods. Promote bushy growth by topping the plants while they are in vegetative growth. The buds produced are very dense, so keep them away from excess moisture to prevent mold.\nFlowering Time: 8 to 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Sensi Star likes a controlled, drier climate with temperatures between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Grows well indoors or outdoors.\nFeeding: Feed this strain with a normal feeding regimen to achieve quality results.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/30105253/sensi-star-strain.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-sensi-star-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":561,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":47.545589625827368},{"name":"Sweet","score":23.610891337488663},{"name":"Pungent","score":22.089307423631347},{"name":"Flowery","score":19.82478145925397},{"name":"Lemon","score":11.317998494818703}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":95.68726963972135},{"name":"Happy","score":67.086605816174909},{"name":"Euphoric","score":53.07028038825959},{"name":"Sleepy","score":51.195075355550841},{"name":"Giggly","score":27.386484243839369}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":50.917195731460218},{"name":"Pain","score":39.710638544219528},{"name":"Depression","score":35.087995214295361},{"name":"Insomnia","score":34.328650547075512},{"name":"Inflammation","score":20.58557341618263}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":55.841454236699406},{"name":"PTSD","score":27.107157330039943},{"name":"Migraines","score":20.178402578105402},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":18.692518477065281},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":17.719360876864592}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":50.4980606317902},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":14.280986472665521},{"name":"Anxious","score":10.37147102526003},{"name":"Dizzy","score":2.8960267073194261},{"name":"Headache","score":1.4294398023967116}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sensi-star_100x100_d791.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/704365/b/sensi-star__primary_667e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sensi-star_100x100_8334.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/653177/b/sensi-star__primary_cd36.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sensi-star_100x100_e8c3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/649515/b/sensi-star__primary_d2a9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sensi-star_100x100_29a0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/641292/b/sensi-star__primary_3bd3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sensi-star_100x100_afde.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/636016/b/sensi-star__primary_6c01.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sensi-star_100x100_f3eb.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/628657/b/sensi-star__primary_b2b5.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":148,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Phoenix, AZ","Vancouver, BC","Seattle, WA","Montréal, QC","Toronto, ON","Tucson, AZ","Bremerton, WA","Calgary, AB","Denver, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/sensi-star","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.15686274509804/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":"Early October","height":"Short","averageYield":null,"environment":"Indoor","growNotes":"\n\tIdeal for sea of green (SOG) setup\n\tVegging for two\u0026nbsp;weeks prior to 12/12 cycle recommended\n\n"}}
