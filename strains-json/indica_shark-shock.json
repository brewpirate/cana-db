            "text": "The most highly anticipated stretch of summer is here: Shark Week. It's a seven day-long marathon where we gather around our televisions to gawk, mouth agape with terror, at the aquatic beasts staring back at use with their dead eyes and rows of razor-sharp teeth. To more adequately prepare you for a week-long bout with the only sea creature to ever kill Samuel L. Jackson, here are a few strains that will have you saying, \u201cWe need a bigger boat\" (or bowl).\n\u00a0\u00a0Great White Shark\nThe Great White Shark is the mob boss of the deep blue sea. Having survived for millions of years on the flesh of others, this creature doesn\u2019t only have a taste for blood, it lives for it. If you manage to get your hands on its ravenous strain counterpart, take note of its fruity odor and dense coating of crystals. Indulge in this strain's pleasant olfactory and visual stimuli, because it will likely be your last, right before Great White Shark takes a bite right out of your dome-piece.\n\u00a0\u00a0Shark Shock\nWhen I think of Shock Shark, I think of some electrified abomination with gleaming bone saws for teeth and a devil-may-care attitude. This particular strain is more stunning than shocking, leaning toward full indica genetics that stink of skunks devoured by this carnivorous lightning rod floating just below the water\u2019s placid surface.\n\u00a0\u00a0OG Shark\nOG Shark makes more sense than people give it credit for. Ocean Grown Shark is the only kind of shark I\u2019ve seen. So, knowing OG Shark began in Canada makes this cartilaginous predator slightly more polite, but it will still bite you right in the face. Canadian or not, this shark only knows mind-altering ferocity.\n\u00a0\u00a0CBD Shark\nCBD Shark, the only CBD strain to make the shark list, is like the squeaky rubber shark toy you might play with in the bath, except it weights two\u00a0thousand pounds. While it may be less intimidating by way of its supplementary anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety effects, this 80/20 indica will straight bite your legs off, making leaving the couch or bed or floor slightly more difficult. But don\u2019t even sweat it \u2014 you'll be so lit on CBD Shark you\u2019ll barely notice your missed appendages.\n\u00a0\u00a0Shark Bite\nShark Bite is one of Leafly\u2019s more literal shark strains. This strain is a cross of Great White Shark and Face Off OG, which is a suitable combination for this week-long television holiday dedicated to ocean predators that have the ability to remove body parts from unsuspecting victims.\n\u00a0\u00a0Shark Attack\nShark Attack is a beautiful indica-dominant cross with rather conventional genetics. Crossing Super Skunk and White Widow, one hit of this strain will have you hearing John William\u2019s Jaws score. Every dark corridor or unlit room become a vast, inky ocean full of razor-sharp teeth. This munchie-inducing strain will have you thanking your fridge manufacturer for the tiny interior light. (Just kidding, your fridge is full of sharks, too.)\nShark Week may only happen one week a year, but you can find potent strains that will take a bite out of your anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and laziness any time at Leafly \u2014 just check our Strain Explorer for options, or take a peek at some of our recommendations for strong cannabis strains.\n.",

            "text": "This strain listed on here is not accurate. I have grown this strain from a local dispensary here in California. \n\nQUICK REVIEW: Sativa dominant hybrid, not Indica.  Very powerful recreational psychedelic euphoric & happy high, skunky lemony/pine-sol chemical scent, frosted & covered in trichomes, not recommended for medical use.  Not recommended for beginners.\n\nFULL REVIEW:\n\nCharacteristics: Very fast growth, very fast flowering period of 50-55 days. COVERED in trichomes, very frosty lemon chemical-scented bud covered in leaves. The bud leaves themselves contain a very high content of THC of ~13-16%. While the buds contain around 18-22%. CBD not noted. A moderate/high yield strain that reacts very well to lst methods & topping indoors. The buds and leaves are very sticky, the fan leaves will have trichomes frosted around the bases!\n\nIf you receive Shark Shock and it is not covered in tri's, it is not Shark Shock. \n\nHigh: The high is extremely stoney, with a strong psychedelic effect. The buzz sets in within 10 minutes and will peak within an hour. The effects will fade very slowly and evenly over the next 3-4 hours. Very sensual, may cause creative thinking, and very amazing vivid dreams.\n\nIn my experience, this is a very strong bud with a chemical pine-sol/lemony scent. In small amounts it is skunky lemon, which smells great. This bud appears to be a primarily SATIVA hybrid (70/30). Not Indica (as posted.) \n\nThis strain is not a great medical strain due to it's psychological effects, however it is a powerful recreational strain. Not recommended for beginners. However, it may be good for users with stress, lack of appetite, and pain. Do not use for depression.\n\n(NOTE: Some pictures of this strain displayed are not Shark Shock, please be aware of this and view this review to determine if you really have Shark Shock.\n\nMy Rating:\n9.5/10",
