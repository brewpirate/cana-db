            "text": "In honor of Thanksgiving, the Leafly Strain Review Hall of Fame proudly presents \u2013 Strain Reviews: The Food Edition.\nBasically \u2013 eat everything in sight!\u00a0\nTrainwreck\nGreat! Now I want avocados.\n\nThis stuff is awesome. I just ate like four avocados.\n\nHeadband\nWe hope that you have more than just Chinese food this Thanksgiving.\u00a0 But, if you\u2019re gonna have Chinese food\u2026.it might as well be mind-blowing.\n\nMade Chinese food basically orgasmic.\n\nGreen Crack\nEver have one of those moments?\n\nI just stopped watching the TV cos I couldn't taste my potato chips..\n\nAmnesia\nAren\u2019t we all looking forward to a few moments of straight-up being a potato on Thanksgiving?\u00a0 I know I am.\n\nStart a good film, in a couch or in the bed. Then\u2026. relax. Enjoy the moment of being a potato. In a fucking good way of being a potato.\u00a0\n\nShishkaberry\nPublic Service Announcement: We know you will be surrounded by family and the chances of paranoia will be high (pun absolutely intended).\u00a0 However, please refrain from eating dirt to disguise your breath.\u00a0 Just eat a breath mint. \u00a0Or some cranberry sauce. Hell, drink some gravy.\u00a0 Even that would be better than dirt.\n\nI ate dirt because I thought my breath smelled of weed in public. Yeah, I was that high.\n\nBlue Dream\nNeat trick.\u00a0 So\u2026\u00a0can we all blame any weight gain on Blue Dream?\n\nGives me serious munchies. I blame my 20 pound weight gain on the dream :)\n\nBlue Hawaiian\nWell, this just sounds delightful!\u00a0 And perfect for dealing with the stressors of the holidays. \u00a0Make sure you get the \u201cjust right\u201d medicinal dose \u2013 don\u2019t drop that turkey!\n\nSmells like Christmas trees, tastes like pine and lightens the heart and mind. \u00a0I found it made the whole holiday with ALL the family, very enjoyable. Oh and added benefits of not breaking ornaments or dropping the turkey due to \"just right\" medicinal dose.\n\nBubba Kush\nApparently, Bubba Kush smells like the most delicious parts of Thanksgiving.\n\nsmells like straight up gravy and turkey with hints of kush haha.\u00a0\n\nNepalese\nWe hope your Thanksgiving is as positive and upbeat as if you ate a cloud and rainbows.\u00a0 (And turkey.\u00a0 And mashed potatoes.\u00a0 And stuffing.\u00a0 And PIE. With whipped cream.)\n\nThis stuff made me like everyone and positive and upbeat like I ate a cloud and rainbows or something.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!",
