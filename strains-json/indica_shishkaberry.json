I blame my 20 pound weight gain on the dream :)\n\nBlue Hawaiian\nWell, this just sounds delightful!  And perfect for dealing with the stressors of the holidays.  Make sure you get the “just right” medicinal dose – don’t drop that turkey!\n\nSmells like Christmas trees, tastes like pine and lightens the heart and mind.  I found it made the whole holiday with ALL the family, very enjoyable. Oh and added benefits of not breaking ornaments or dropping the turkey due to \"just right\" medicinal dose.\n\nBubba Kush\nApparently, Bubba Kush smells like the most delicious parts of Thanksgiving.\n\nsmells like straight up gravy and turkey with hints of kush haha. \n\nNepalese\nWe hope your Thanksgiving is as positive and upbeat as if you ate a cloud and rainbows.  (And turkey.  And mashed potatoes.  And stuffing.  And PIE. With whipped cream.)\n\nThis stuff made me like everyone and positive and upbeat like I ate a cloud and rainbows or something.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/16214741/leafly-strain-review-hall-of-fame-food-edition.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/leafly-strain-review-hall-of-fame-food-edition"}],"reviewCount":268,"flavors":[{"name":"Berry","score":16.064852700491},{"name":"Sweet","score":10.126841243862522},{"name":"Blueberry","score":6.2363611565739223},{"name":"Earthy","score":3.7302236770321873},{"name":"Flowery","score":2.506137479541735}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":26.979337152209496},{"name":"Relaxed","score":26.534369885433716},{"name":"Euphoric","score":16.363202400436442},{"name":"Uplifted","score":15.503955264593563},{"name":"Sleepy","score":15.343698854337152}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":13.274004364429896},{"name":"Insomnia","score":9.90861974904528},{"name":"Pain","score":7.576377523186034},{"name":"Headaches","score":7.1620976541189307},{"name":"Depression","score":6.957515002727769}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":11.146344789961812},{"name":"PMS","score":3.6500954719039824},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":2.4260092744135298},{"name":"PTSD","score":2.3237179487179489},{"name":"Migraines","score":1.9230769230769231}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":8.3640207310420074},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":7.6786688488816148},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.3458810692853245},{"name":"Dizzy","score":2.1054964539007091},{"name":"Headache","score":1.8651118385160936}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/shishkaberry_100x100_a9f9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001927/b/shishkaberry__primary_317c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/shishkaberry_100x100_a25f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001926/b/shishkaberry__primary_3508.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/shishkaberry_100x100_e155.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/639795/b/shishkaberry__primary_a095.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/shishkaberry_100x100_6087.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/516143/b/shishkaberry__primary_aedc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/shishkaberry_100x100_9547.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/506485/b/shishkaberry__primary_6c48.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/shishkaberry_100x100_4281.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/502579/b/shishkaberry__primary_07f0.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":61,"popularCities":["Toronto, ON","Portland, OR","Montréal, QC","Vancouver, BC","Calgary, AB","Ottawa, ON","Edmonton, AB","Hamilton, ON","Mississauga, ON","Eugene, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/shishkaberry","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.27238805970149/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"DJ Short Blueberry","subtitle":null,"slug":"dj-short-blueberry","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/dj-short-blueberry","symbol":"Dsb","applink":"leafly://strain/dj-short-blueberry"},{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
