            "text": "The staff at my local dispensary suggested this strain for my Lupus and Fibromyalgia pains. I was not disappointed. The first time I tried this flower I had had a bad episode earlier that day. My body was wracked with pain and my muscles were so cramped that I was also having deep tissue spasms  and twitches. My pain did not completely diminish. However my pain level went from not being able to function or speak to a 3. That is better than any prescription medication I have ever tried. \nNow be forewarned that I could not have functioned in a public capacity for I was so relaxed and in a meditative state and basically in a incoherent state to deal with the rational of society. \nSo when the description says \"only\" use this medicine at night before bed, heed the warning and go by the recommendation. Other than that I enjoyed the relaxation and almost lack of pain. \nEven my vertigo went to the wayside.",
