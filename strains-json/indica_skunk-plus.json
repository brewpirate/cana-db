She is also known as Power Skunk and from what I know about her she does seem to be one of the most popular stains in the world !  This wondrous strain brought to us by those geniuses in Spain at Kannabia Seeds !  \n\nhttps://www.kannabia.es/fr/kannabia/skunk\n\nSkunk it\u0027s said is an American strain but I grew her exclusively throughout the 70\u0027s and into the early 80\u0027s.  I grew her in Northern BC  !   To see 48 years running Skunks popularity has never waned a minute.\n\nBlack Domina I have known and loved since she arrived in Canada in the early 90\u0027s I was first introduced to her by a friend that had a medical garden of BD and Lemon Skunk in the Hawkesbury area of Ontario.\n\nThe two strains together are a magical blend of the best of the best strains and this strain has me in her throughs !!   This strain has everything anybody would want in a hard hitting Indica she is the closest to 100 % you get in a blend of genetics but even with a smaller amount of Sativa genes in play she is still very euphorique as her Skunk parent ever was.   This is one of the most relaxing strains I\u0027ve had in the recently.  Quite literally one of the best sedatives herbary that exist !  If your day has you down this will stimulate you while it knocks you off your feet !  I would recommend that those of you who tend to steer away from the more sedative strains to try this end of the day for one of the best sleep meds that really do work.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Fw0JEfqG0tfLyB-h0kujFvz9k-0=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2fleafly-images%2fuser-profile%2fYVopYOS5SXadF7Hukmhn_aj133670_LemonOGKush2.jpg"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":4,"flavors":[{"name":"Pungent","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Sage","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Pepper","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Mint","score":16.666666666666664}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":50},{"name":"Happy","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Hungry","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Aroused","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Sleepy","score":16.666666666666664}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":50},{"name":"Depression","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Headaches","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Insomnia","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Cramps","score":16.666666666666664}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"PTSD","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Alzheimer\u0027s","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Anorexia","score":16.666666666666664}],"negatives":[],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Bellevue, WA","Toronto, ON","Vancouver, BC","Aurora, CO","Barrie, ON","Bay City, MI","Bellingham, WA","Calgary, AB","Colorado Springs, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/skunk-plus","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.75/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Black Domina","subtitle":null,"slug":"black-domina","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/black-domina","symbol":"Bdm","applink":"leafly://strain/black-domina"},{"name":"Skunk No. 1","subtitle":null,"slug":"skunk-1","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1","symbol":"Sk1","applink":"leafly://strain/skunk-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
