            "text": "The Leafly strain database now exceeds 1,700 varieties, but our collection is far from finished. These seven strains are only a few among many newly added varieties, so don't forget to check out all of the other newcomers in the Explorer! Leave reviews for the ones you've tried or check the links below to see if any are offered at a cannabis shop near you.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a01. Alien Abduction\n\nAlien Abduction is an OG Kush hybrid bred by So-Cal medical collective Ocean Grown Genetics, who crossed an Alien OG male with the Ether cut of Alien Dawg. These seeds have been highly sought after by growers, as they are known to have great germination rates and multiple excellent phenotypes, all of which are robust and vigorous plants. Most phenotypes exhibit typical OG Kush smells and flavors, and pack a high-THC punch that combines a potent head buzz with a strongly sedating body high. For many patients, Alien Abduction is a great appetite stimulant and sleep aid.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Alien Abduction\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a02. Hurricane\n\nHurricane is a 70/30 sativa-dominant hybrid from Colorado breeders Reserva Privada that combines the spicy Haze genetics of Panama Punch with the OG Kush flavors of the award-winning LA Confidential. These flowers give off a mix of fruity smells with undertones of spice, and an earthy, herbal flavor when smoked or vaporized. Its potent mix of indica and sativa genetics produces a pleasant, giggly head high with a pain-relieving indica effects, and is generally considered suitable for daytime use.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Hurricane\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a03. Snow Leopard\n\nSnow Leopard, from the mysterious breeder Bodhi Seeds, is one of the more unique seed strains out there, crossing the dual multinational genetics of Tigermelon and Snow Lotus, both of which have strong Haze and Afghani influences as well as Thai and Mexican elements. The majority of observed phenotypes are indica-dominant plants that produce numerous sticky colas and a rich tropical smell with woody undertones. Known for its \u201ccreeper\u201d effect, Snow Leopard will eventually leave the user in a tranquil cloud, lost in deep thought and glued to their seat.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Snow Leopard\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a04. Black Cherry Cheesecake\n\nThought to have originated in Southern Oregon from an unknown breeder, Black Cherry Cheesecake is an indica-dominant hybrid that supposedly crosses Black Cherry Soda, Super Silver Haze, and Cheese. These large, pink-tinged purple flowers smell like cherries and sugar, and possess a flavor that is aptly described by the name. Black Cherry Cheesecake leaves users relatively clear-headed while providing strong, sedating body sensations that can make motivation difficult.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Black Cherry Cheesecake\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a05. Blaze\n\nBritish Columbia Seed Company crossed the indica Blueberry with Haze in order to tame this lanky, long-flowering Blaze. This large sativa-dominant plant combines the soaring cerebral high and sweet-spicy smell of Haze, while getting shorter flowering times and a distinct dried-grape aroma from Blueberry. Blaze is closely related to Blueberry Haze and Blue Dream.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Blaze\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a06. Panda OG\n\nFrom Grow Op Farms\u2019 Phat Panda line, Panda OG is a hybrid from Washington State that crosses two sativa-dominant hybrids, OG Chem and Berry Sour Cream. Combining a long-lasting cerebral high with a sedating body buzz, this strain is great for treating anxiety, appetite loss, and insomnia. Panda OG smells very spicy yet earthy, and tastes sour on the tongue with slight undertones of berry.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Panda OG\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a07. Madman OG\n\nAnother excellent hybrid from Southern California breeders Ocean Grown Genetics, Madman OG combines LA Confidential with OG Kush to create a powerful and delicious indica. Generally considered a high-THC strain, it has been tested at anywhere from 16-24%. Smooth coffee flavors give way to sour earthy undertones, with a fresh pine scent typical of many OG Kush varieties. Madman OG gives users a pleasant, relaxed body high that often leads to munchies and sleep.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Madman OG\n\u00a0\nBrowse through other new strains that were added recently to the Leafly Explorer ,or check out last week's newest additions!",

The stuff is so covered in trichomes the entire bud takes on a frosty bluish tint to it to me it has a classic quality weed fragrance, kinda hashy, and sweet. The high starts out with a burst of energy and a pleasant mood kicks in as time goes on it becomes more relaxing and introspective it just seems to keep getting heavier and heavier! I really, really like the high on this one.  I struggled alot on 4 or 5 stars so I'll say 4.75 ",
