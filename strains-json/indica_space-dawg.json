    "description": "<p>Space Dawg&rsquo;s sticky buds are known for their delicious flavor and potent indica punch that will have pain (and maybe mental focus) gone in no time. THC levels in this strain have tested at 18-19%, so it might take users on a trip that&rsquo;s better reserved for night time. TGA Subcool Seeds created this strain by breeding <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/sativa/super-snow-dog\">Super Snow Dog</a> with <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen\">Space Queen</a>. These plants are resilient growers and usually flower within 8 weeks. Space Dawg has a strong skunky smell that is toned down with grapey bubble gum notes. The flavor is just like fruit candy with the right amount of lemony sourness.</p>\n",

The smell is very strong. The kind of bud that as soon as you open the jar the room reaks. Fuelly smell with a sweet taste. Had me really spacey for about 30 minutes as I finished up the movie I had been watching than it put me right to sleep. It actually kept me asleep for most of the night (which is rare for me). Overall I would say it's not a bad strain. Definitely good for Insomnia and Stress. 8.5/10 ",
