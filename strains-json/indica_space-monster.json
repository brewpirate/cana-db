I did a 40sec heat and a 60sec cool. \n\nFrom this I experienced a wonderfully sweet on the inhail then a light chemical taste on the exhale  mixed with a candy taste. Kinda of like the candy rockets from Halloween. \n The effect got me almost imedatly ,this is deffenatly not a creeper it hits imedatly and seemed to get stronger over about an hour. \n\nI felt an imitate affect of euphoria and calming. I would deffenatly say this is effective for reducing anxiety. At the peak I felt somewhat detached from my self... not sure if that makes sense or if it was something that I liked or disliked. The effects lasted for about 3.5-4.25 hrs and I was quite pleased over all with the strain.",
