Elected by you, this week\u0027s new strains include Buddha Tahoe, Skunk Dawg, Cerebro Haze, Maui Pineapple Chunk, Dreamer\u0027s Glass, Special Kush #1, and Booger (yes, \"Booger\"). Read more about each variety below, and if you\u0027ve come across any of these newcomers in your own strain hunting, enlighten us with a strain review. Keep the tips coming!\n \n   1. Maui Pineapple Chunk\n\nMaui Pineapple Chunk is a 50/50 hybrid bred by Pau Mana Seeds, who crossed Pineapple Chunk with their Nāhiku Maui Waui to create this balanced Hawaiian strain. Sweet and sour tropical flavors reminiscent of this strain’s homeland deliver you to a calm, uplifted mindset far away from stress.\n\n \n   2. Buddha Tahoe\n\nBuddha Tahoe is what you get when Big Buddha Seeds reverses Cali Connection’s Tahoe OG Kush to create their own rendition of this indica staple. Like its OG ancestors, Buddha Tahoe maintains a zesty lemon and earthy hash aroma typical of kush varieties. Potent and long-lasting, Buddha Tahoe launches you into to the highest level of cerebral euphoria which won this strain 3rd place in the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup.\n\n \n   3. Skunk Dawg\n\nSkunk Dawg is a sativa-dominant cross between Super Skunk and Chemdawg that elevates the mood with a sweet and sour aroma. Its effects are long-lasting but clear-headed, making Skunk Dawg a popular choice for use throughout the day. This sativa may be all you need to give your appetite an edge or to help you stay productive and focused.\n\n \n   4. Dreamer\u0027s Glass\n\nDreamer’s Glass is a hybrid cannabis strain that delivers dreamy euphoric effects alongside heavy body effects that let you settle deeply in relaxation. This strain is great for patients needing potent relief of nausea and mild pain, but expect to feel more and more anchored to your couch as you increase the dose.\n\n \n   5. Special Kush #1\n\nSpecial Kush #1 by Royal Queen Seeds is an 80/20 indica-dominant strain that descends from the original varieties of the Afghanistan and Pakistan region. Those who love the physical and deeply relaxing effects typical of indicas won’t be disappointed by the heavy-hitting qualities of Special Kush #1. This indica isn’t difficult to cultivate, but she requires a warm environment and plenty of room to grow wild for best results.\n\n \n   6. Cerebro Haze\n\nCerebro Haze is a sativa-dominant strain that crosses Brain OG with Tom Hills Haze. As its name suggests, Cerebro Haze focuses its efforts in the head and provides a clean, clear buzz that allows you to stay active and functional. Despite its sativa influence, Cerebro Haze still provides relaxing full-body effects preferred by patients treating pain and headaches.\n\n \n   7. Booger\n\nBooger may not have an appetizing name, but a look at this hybrid’s genetics may be all the convincing you need to give this strain a try: Strawberry Cough combines with Bubba Kush to create a balanced effect that walks the line between physical relaxation and cerebral energy. This Colorado native introduces itself with a sweet berry and sour skunk aroma while earthy, hashy flavors are detected on the exhale. With uplifting and calming effects, Booger uncoils stress and worry while encouraging a more lighthearted outlook on life (because seriously, you’re consuming a strain called “Booger”).","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/12002005/new-strains-alert-buddha-tahoe-skunk-dawg-cerebro-haze-maui-pinea.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-buddha-tahoe-skunk-dawg-cerebro-haze-maui-pinea"}],"reviewCount":16,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":73.48484848484847},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":67.8030303030303},{"name":"Woody","score":67.8030303030303},{"name":"Coffee","score":67.8030303030303},{"name":"Pepper","score":66.666666666666657}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":91.287878787878768},{"name":"Euphoric","score":72.348484848484844},{"name":"Happy","score":71.2121212121212},{"name":"Hungry","score":5.6818181818181817},{"name":"Sleepy","score":4.5454545454545459}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":22.348484848484844},{"name":"Insomnia","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Depression","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Stress","score":3.4090909090909087}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Anorexia","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Cancer","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","score":2.2727272727272729}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.1363636363636365}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/special-kush--1_100x100_1b11.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/583282/b/special-kush--1__primary_b03f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/special-kush--1_100x100_444b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/558444/b/special-kush--1__primary_8786.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/special-kush--1_100x100_e4c2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/530233/b/special-kush--1__primary_1617.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/special-kush--1_100x100_d7be.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/529744/b/special-kush--1__primary_2c52.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/special-kush--1_100x100_766e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522282/b/special-kush--1__primary_51d6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/special-kush--1_100x100_36ca.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/509735/b/special-kush--1__primary_0e92.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":9,"popularCities":["Everett, WA","Nelson, BC"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/special-kush-1","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.625/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Afghani","subtitle":null,"slug":"afghani","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/afghani","symbol":"Afg","applink":"leafly://strain/afghani"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":53,"outdoorFinish":"Late September","height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
