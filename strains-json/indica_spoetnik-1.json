This plant is tall and resilient, making it ideal for new growers seeking a plant with a larger than average yield. &nbsp;</p>\n",

Awesome day time smoke, but the more you toke, the more couch-lock it becomes. Super easy to grow with short flower times and good yield.  Overall great and highly recommendable.",
