            "text": "Since the dawn of the silver screen, music and movies have gone together like Thelma and Louise. In the old films of yesteryear, when audio technology for spoken dialogue was not yet established, music brought to life the actions and scenes presented to an audience without the use of speech. Since then, tunes in movies have played a large part in manipulating audience emotion and setting tones for dramatic, comedic, horrific, and all manner of theatrical movements.\nTo celebrate the upcoming Oscars awards ceremony (which airs Sunday, February 26), we compiled a range of movie soundtracks to listen to while high. From past Academy Award winners to general good beats, turn off your screens and instead opt for a pair of headphones to truly soak in these incredible scores.\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\nThis entire adventure series was composed, conducted, produced,\u00a0and orchestrated by Howard Shore, who contributed more than 10\u00a0hours of music for the epic saga. The films\u2019 scores were so enigmatic that two of them took home Academy awards for Best Original Score \u2013 one for The Fellowship of the Ring (2002) and one for The Return of the King (2004).\nBased on our\u00a0own personal experience, we couldn\u2019t possibly turn our noses up at one of the best and most emotional instrumental scores punctuating The Lord of the Rings series. From the moment we hear those familiar Hobbit-inspired flutes to the dramatic deep strings regaling Sauron\u2019s lair, listening to this broad soundtrack is a mix of nostalgia and a new sense of adventure. Clear your schedule for hours of bold and beautiful tunes, and be sure to pair this daring collection with the hybrid Hobbit.\nPretty in Pink\n\nThough this film\u2019s soundtrack didn\u2019t take home any awards, it\u2019d be a mistake not to include it in our collection of picks. You\u2019ll be bringing back the \u201980s with now-classics (considered \u201cnew wave\u201d at the time) played in one of John Hughes\u2019 biggest hits. From bands New Order to The Smiths, we don\u2019t think you\u2019ll mind getting any of these tracks stuck in your head. Dance your heart out and pair this movie soundtrack with the sweet hybrid Pink Kush.\nWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\n\nThis 1971 children\u2019s classic gave audiences around the world a wild ride that also extends to its assorted soundtrack. From sticky-sweet \u201cThe Candy Man\u201d to\u00a0Charlie\u2019s mother\u2019s lamenting \u201cCheer-Up Charlie,\u201d all the way to the odd fear-driven track accompanying the infamous tunnel scene, the original Willy Wonka touches on all facets of human emotion. Gather up your favorite candy and pair this soundtrack with its perfect match, sativa Willy Wonka.\nLife of Pi\n\nWorldly, charismatic, and just plain beautiful, the Life of Pi score won the 2013 Academy Award for Best Original Music Score as well as the Golden Globe for the same title (composed by Mychael Danna). Cranking up\u00a0this soundtrack is sure to transport you to faraway lands. We recommend pairing Life of Pi\u2019s gorgeous pieces with the cerebral indica Tiger\u2019s Milk.\nForrest Gump\n\nReaching gold and platinum status from countries around the world, the Forrest Gump soundtrack is flanked with its own original score as well as a huge array of classic rock pieces. It was nominated for Best Music and Original Score in 1995 (beat out by The Lion King), and it\u2019s definitely not difficult to see why. From Scott McKenzie\u2019s \u201cSan Francisco\u201d to Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s \u201cMrs. Robinson,\u201d be sure to light up the hybrid Jenny Kush and sink into the various tunes of the late greats.\nInterstellar\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to smoke up alongside tracks that could transport you across planes of time, look no further than the music of Interstellar. We recommend you invest in a little star projector, shut off all the lights in your room, and bask in the mind-blowing complexities of the universe while the Interstellar score quietly plays in your ears. Pair this haunting soundtrack with the indica StarBud or the intense sativa Timewreck.\nHave your own soundtrack suggestions? Leave them in the comments below!",

This is always a knock-out punch, leaving you flat on your ass. This is the type that will leave your ass on the couch and you are thinking \"Why the hell is my body and head so heavy?! Am I turning into a rock? Why is gravity so strong?!\" If you have issues with insomnia or staying asleep, this is the cure. If you want to feel like you got the heaviest sleep of your life, this is what you want to smoke.
