            "text": "Love this strain so much. Have been able to continually sample Deschutes Growery's rendition of it and it's continued to be my favorite thing we have on the shelf. This strain is gently euphoric and relaxing combining some of my favorite effects. The smell is earthy, funky, dank, and nutty, like someone stuffed a hazelnut with mostly decomposed dog shit. The taste is the same as the smell; funky and smooth. It's a great after work strain. I wouldn't recommend it if you have anything particularly pressing to do as you will quickly forget your task to become a part of the couch.",
