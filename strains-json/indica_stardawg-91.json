Have been able to continually sample Deschutes Growery\u0027s rendition of it and it\u0027s continued to be my favorite thing we have on the shelf. This strain is gently euphoric and relaxing combining some of my favorite effects. The smell is earthy, funky, dank, and nutty, like someone stuffed a hazelnut with mostly decomposed dog shit. The taste is the same as the smell; funky and smooth. It\u0027s a great after work strain. I wouldn\u0027t recommend it if you have anything particularly pressing to do as you will quickly forget your task to become a part of the couch.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/YEN1LqXiYCOvWiFhmP-4p67iqDM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fY9fB9qHySLml8016ysgJ_goggles-green.png"},{"id":1569574,"username":"brightonbud","text":"great strain really deisely taste and good for sleeping and reliving anxiety\u0027s.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/8AEOnyObscLzPEdm7ERjYOUx4RU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fP4YFTRznSDCEVP7Fycg7_nerd-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":2,"flavors":[{"name":"Diesel","score":150},{"name":"Pepper","score":50},{"name":"Earthy","score":50},{"name":"Pungent","score":50},{"name":"Skunk","score":50}],"effects":[{"name":"Sleepy","score":150},{"name":"Euphoric","score":150},{"name":"Relaxed","score":150},{"name":"Aroused","score":100},{"name":"Happy","score":50}],"symptoms":[],"conditions":[],"negatives":[],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":[],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/stardawg-91","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Stardawg","subtitle":null,"slug":"stardawg","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/stardawg","symbol":"Sta","applink":"leafly://strain/stardawg"},{"name":"Chemdawg 91","subtitle":null,"slug":"chemdawg-91","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/chemdawg-91","symbol":"C91","applink":"leafly://strain/chemdawg-91"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
