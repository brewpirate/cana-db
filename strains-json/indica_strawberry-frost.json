I am glad I did. I love Space Queen because of it\u0027s trippy high, and that carried through on this Strawberry frost. I felt like I was swirling around the world. It was also dreamy, euphoric and relaxed. Fantastic effects! I got some strawberry flavor with some citrus and just a touch of earthiness. Very tasty. It had a nice high potency too at 25.78% THC. Very nice smoke.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1560501,"username":"JustinHaleMusic","text":"Grabbed a pre roll of this at Ganja Goddess in seattle!
