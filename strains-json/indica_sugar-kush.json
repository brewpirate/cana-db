            "text": "This is by far in the top 5 of the best strain that I have ever had. It took care of my pain caused from crohns disease. Watch out she will sneak up on you, I finished one bowl and thought this is bunk weed so I started to pack another bowl and by the time I reached for the flower container she kicked in and I forgot what the hell I was doing. Gave me a great appetite the medicated feeling lasts between 2-3 hours depending on your tolerance. I personally have smoked every day for the last 4 years and it lasts about 2 for me.  about 4 hours after smoking was able to fall asleep for 10 hours uninterrupted. I recommend this strain for sleep and intense pain and it dosent take much and dont forget she's a creeper.   Will update tomorrow about how she is in a bag and a whip vaporizer stay tuned!!",
