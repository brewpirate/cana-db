After 1 minute I started to feel some of the body stone yet it was a different stone.  My thighs felt a warming sensation similar to a percocet. The surface of my skin had a slight numbing sensation but not like icey hot. The migraine I had went from a 9 to a 3.  Time slowed, Television was more interesting.  increased appreciation for food tastes but not munchies.
