            "text": "As 2014 has come to a close, we look back and reflect on the strain reviews of yesteryear.\u00a0We laughed, we cried, and we never underestimated the power of the munchies in some of our more vocal Leafly users.\u00a0Here are our favorite strain reviews from 2014:\n10. GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\nThis review sums up the glory, the deliciousness, and the pungency of cannabis (Lil\u2019 Wayne, though?\u00a0Seriously?)\n\nCannabis has many things to be proud of and this strain is it.. pretty sure leafly was created on it.. god created yoga pants on it, the oceans grew, the gods bathe in it, its little waynes cologne\u2026 well maybe\n\n9. Ed Rosenthal Super Bud\nHas the Space Coyote helped you find your soulmate yet?\n\nThis stuff knocks me out, not in the sleepy way, but in the \"Homer Simpson meets the Space Coyote\" sort of way.\n\n8. Blueberry Headband\nGross, but points for being descriptive.\n\nGave me a warm happy feeling. Kind of like peeing in a hot tub.\n\n7. Green Crack\nOne of Leafly\u2019s most popular strains inspired this poetic ode to cannabis.\n\nMind=bent \nLovely scent \nDank lament \nGo cannabis\n\n6. Blueberry\nCannabis: saving the world by relieving PMS.\n\nIt is good for pms all of my homicidal thoughts have gone away as well as pain I am high right now. nobody has to die tonight. Thanks pot :)\n\n5. Nepalese\nSometimes you inhale cannabis and exhale sunshine and rainbows and it\u2019s just\u2026.it\u2019s just great.\n\nThis stuff made me like everyone and positive and upbeat like I ate a cloud and rainbows or something.\n\n4. Sour Diesel\nOne of our most WTF strain reviews in 2014 was short and sweet and completely baffling.\n\nInstructions not clear Dick stuck in fan\n\n3. Super Lemon Haze\nAny experiences toker will tell you, Super Lemon Haze is a fun, upbeat, and energetic strain.\u00a0Add tequila at your own discretion.\n\nKicks you right in the ass if paired with tequila. And by kicked in the ass i mean set on fire and dancing naked. \u00a0\n\n2. Banana OG\nI think we\u2019ve all felt this before \u2013 so enamored with the joy of your munchies when all of the mesmerizing flavors combine in your mouth, it\u2019s just one blissful, delicious hug.\n\n\"Smoked this. About 20 mins later I felt like a little girl skipping through a wheat field towards an ice cream with arms n legs before a choc chip cookie, also with arms and legs, skipped towards us making the happiest group hug I've ever had inside a baskin robbins. =)\"\n\n1. Purple Haze\nEasily our favorite strain review from 2014, the compelling tale of an adventurer and his crustacean companion won our hearts and made us wish that we, too, had a little crawdad friend.\n\nTook me from down in the dumps to having a cool time. Went on an adventure and found a crawdad. I subsequently made friends with said crawdad and hung out with him. Man I miss Craymond.",
