Nepalese\nSometimes you inhale cannabis and exhale sunshine and rainbows and it’s just….it’s just great.\n\nThis stuff made me like everyone and positive and upbeat like I ate a cloud and rainbows or something.\n\n4. Sour Diesel\nOne of our most WTF strain reviews in 2014 was short and sweet and completely baffling.\n\nInstructions not clear Dick stuck in fan\n\n3. Super Lemon Haze\nAny experiences toker will tell you, Super Lemon Haze is a fun, upbeat, and energetic strain. Add tequila at your own discretion.\n\nKicks you right in the ass if paired with tequila. And by kicked in the ass i mean set on fire and dancing naked.  \n\n2. Banana OG\nI think we’ve all felt this before – so enamored with the joy of your munchies when all of the mesmerizing flavors combine in your mouth, it’s just one blissful, delicious hug.\n\n\"Smoked this. About 20 mins later I felt like a little girl skipping through a wheat field towards an ice cream with arms n legs before a choc chip cookie, also with arms and legs, skipped towards us making the happiest group hug I\u0027ve ever had inside a baskin robbins. =)\"\n\n1.

Green Crack\nOne of Leafly’s most popular strains inspired this poetic ode to cannabis.\n\nMind=bent \nLovely scent \nDank lament \nGo cannabis\n\n6. Blueberry\nCannabis: saving the world by relieving PMS.\n\nIt is good for pms all of my homicidal thoughts have gone away as well as pain I am high right now. nobody has to die tonight. Thanks pot :)\n\n5. Nepalese\nSometimes you inhale cannabis and exhale sunshine and rainbows and it’s just….it’s just great.\n\nThis stuff made me like everyone and positive and upbeat like I ate a cloud and rainbows or something.\n\n4. Sour Diesel\nOne of our most WTF strain reviews in 2014 was short and sweet and completely baffling.\n\nInstructions not clear Dick stuck in fan\n\n3. Super Lemon Haze\nAny experiences toker will tell you, Super Lemon Haze is a fun, upbeat, and energetic strain. Add tequila at your own discretion.\n\nKicks you right in the ass if paired with tequila. And by kicked in the ass i mean set on fire and dancing naked.  \n\n2. Banana OG\nI think we’ve all felt this before – so enamored with the joy of your munchies when all of the mesmerizing flavors combine in your mouth, it’s just one blissful, delicious hug.\n\n\"Smoked this. About 20 mins later I felt like a little girl skipping through a wheat field towards an ice cream with arms n legs before a choc chip cookie, also with arms and legs, skipped towards us making the happiest group hug I\u0027ve ever had inside a baskin robbins. =)\"\n\n1. Purple Haze\nEasily our favorite strain review from 2014, the compelling tale of an adventurer and his crustacean companion won our hearts and made us wish that we, too, had a little crawdad friend.\n\nTook me from down in the dumps to having a cool time. Went on an adventure and found a crawdad. I subsequently made friends with said crawdad and hung out with him. Man I miss Craymond.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12001824/leafly-strain-review-hall-of-fame-2014-year-in-review-edition.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/leafly-strain-review-hall-of-fame-2014-year-in-review-edition"}],"reviewCount":17,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":23.809523809523807},{"name":"Mint","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Skunk","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Flowery","score":3.5714285714285712},{"name":"Sweet","score":1.7857142857142856}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":140.47619047619045},{"name":"Hungry","score":120.23809523809523},{"name":"Talkative","score":118.45238095238095},{"name":"Relaxed","score":45.833333333333329},{"name":"Giggly","score":25.595238095238095}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Insomnia","score":22.023809523809522},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":20.238095238095234},{"name":"Pain","score":20.238095238095234},{"name":"Stress","score":20.238095238095234},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":16.666666666666664}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":36.9047619047619},{"name":"PMS","score":18.452380952380949},{"name":"Anorexia","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"PTSD","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":16.666666666666664}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":101.78571428571429},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":18.452380952380949},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.7857142857142856}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-bud_100x100_f026.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/519633/b/super-bud__primary_ba84.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-bud_100x100_bcd1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/519632/b/super-bud__primary_d986.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-bud_100x100_9023.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/507731/b/super-bud__primary_bf10.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-bud_100x100_5c30.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/329853/b/super-bud__primary_bb08.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/super-bud_100x100_eaf5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/312496/b/super-bud__primary_b9bd.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":5,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/super-bud","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.17647058823529/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Big Bud","subtitle":null,"slug":"big-bud","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/big-bud","symbol":"Bb","applink":"leafly://strain/big-bud"},{"name":"Skunk #1","subtitle":null,"slug":"skunk-1","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1","symbol":"Sk1","applink":"leafly://strain/skunk-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":56,"outdoorFinish":"End of September","height":null,"averageYield":"High","environment":"Indoor","growNotes":"\n\tRequires a low-humidity environment when grown outdoors\n\tSuitable for screen of green (SCRoG) and sea of green (SoG) methods\n\tIndoor yields typically fall around 900 grams per square meter\n\tOutdoor yields typically fall around 1000 grams per plant\n\n"}}
