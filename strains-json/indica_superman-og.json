            "text": "I grew up watching Adam West and Burt Ward thwart evildoers after school. Back then I would saunter into the living room and settle down in front of our JC Penney television to admire the collected demeanor of gentleman millionaire Bruce Wayne and his eager ward/sidekick as they unraveled the nefarious tapestry of evil that had been subtly stitched together with sinister subterfuge. (Apparently alliteration attracted audiences back then; or, if nothing else, it gave the dialogue a poetic quality.)\nOne of the most famous turns-of-phrase that came out of the dynamic duo of the mid-60s was Robin\u2019s, \u201cHoly ___, Batman!\u201d This particular set of words arises hilariously often in strain reviews, so without further ado, here\u2019s a small sampling of some of my favorites. Holy strain reviews, Batman!\nHybrid Cannabis Strains\n\u00a0 \u00a0GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\n\n\u201cHoly carp fish, batman. This is magic. Definitely gives you a floaty, yet energized feel. You feel it creeping up behind your eyes and in two shakes of a lambs tail, you\u2019re high as goddamn ever.\u201d \u2013 Anonymous\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Fruity Pebbles\n\n\u201cHoly hand grenade of Antioch, Batman. Smoking this is like watching high speed film of a remote detonation. But a detonation of giggles and time slippage. Bring this to game-night at the beach. I did, and I\u2019m very happy about that. Social, happy, very fast acting. The super-high phase came on within 5 minutes and lasted about 10-20 minutes. After words a really happy normal to low key high kicked in and took the wheel for around 3 hours. Two of us fell asleep during this time and three of us had energy to spare. \u00a0A very solid night sleep followed for me.\u201d \u2013\u00a0ChestyMcDeathrack\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Chemdawg\n\n\u201cHoly space balls batman. I think we\u2019ve got a winner right here. Toked a small bowl last after a month of FireOG and White Widow. Let me tell you I nearly tripped my balls out. I had a legit out of body experience lying in bed with my wife after smoking. Needless to say I couldn\u2019t sleep. Headed down to TV land, Jay Leno\u2019s new show is pretty good.\u201d \u2013 jamtastic\n\nIndica Cannabis Strains\n\u00a0 \u00a0Superman OG\n\n\u201cHoly sh*t Batman, I just found one of the newest to my Top 10!!! Dare I say to the coveted #1 slot?!? Honestly, I love ALL strains but you know the standouts and this strain STANDS out! When the description uses the word \u2018pungent\u2019, yep, it IS pungent and smokes the same. I usually cough during a bowl but the HIGH it totally worth it!! Definitely agree with many, this is NOT for beginners starting on meds like this but for everyone else, if you come across Superman, GET YOU SOME, you will not be disappointed!!! Believe it or not, this doesn\u2019t really knock me out like others I know that have came across it but DAMN, I love the deeply euphoric, giggly, happy, relaxing high, one the best I\u2019ve felt. Thank you GROWERS of this strain, your the BEST!!!\u201d \u2013 dhlvisdrt\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0SFV OG Kush\n\n\u201cHoly amazing sleep, Batman! SLEEPIES!! This knocked my ass OUT \u2013 I haven\u2019t slept in 2 days and this let me sleep for 7 hours straight, didn\u2019t even move. Super important different between this \u2018Kush\u2019 and regular OG\u2026. Smelled like pine, a bit pungent, woody, lemon/citrus, and a slight herbal scent with a little spicy kick. This OG Kush combination is an amazingly super light and smooth smoke! Packed 1/2 a bowl and it tasted like sweet flowers, pine, dankish, and herbal, like tearing open a packet of tea. Went straight to my head and my face was nuuuuumb. Helped my spine amazingly well 5/5, took my kidney stone pain down to 30%, felt cold spots in my back where it hurts, helped with my tendon pain 3/5, and a little bit of nerve pain 2/5 \u2013 noticeable enough. No munchies, I passed out \u2013 definitely a night time use, great for insomnia. Hits heavy, so I wouldn\u2019t use this as a beginner unless you have insomnia \u2013 this is your golden ticket!\u201d \u2013 Midnyte003\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0G-13\n\n\u201cuuuuuuhhhhh\u2026. I don\u2019t remember what I was doing. or anything at all for that matter. where am i, who am i. it\u2019s about like that. lol. by far the best escape from reality I\u2019ve ever experienced personally if u wanna sit back and chill and just not give a shit about a freaking thing period simply cause u can\u2019t remember a freaking thing. this one is an absolute must try to believe what it can actually achieve for you. review does no justice cause it simply cannot be explained in words properly. has to be experienced personally to know. I just got my first experience with it and will definitely be getting again any and every time I have chance. HOLY MOLY COW BATMAN!!!!\u201d \u2013 247kushpuffer\n\nSativa Cannabis Strains\n\u00a0 \u00a0Crystal Coma\n\n\u201cHoly high, Batman! This is some amazing product! Awesome high, good upper, and I\u2019m not a space cadet either! Perfect for a \u2018getting shit done but still would like to smoke\u2019 day.\u201d \u2013 Anonymous\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Sour Diesel\n\n\u201cHoly racing heart beat and heart pounding out of my chest batman! Everyone has the same experience.\u201d \u2013 Anonymous\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0East Coast Sour Diesel\n\n\u201cHoly Batman! This thing is like a triple dose of espresso for me! Makes me so hyper I cannot sit still LOL.! Energetic for sure, good for picking up the afternoon blehs. Also gives you an appetite. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll smoke this at night or I\u2019ll be sleepless!\u201d \u2013 HappilyPainFree\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Alaskan Thunder Fuck\n\n\u201cHoly sweet jumped up sativa, Batman. This has to be the most aptly named strain yet. As powerful and as potent as being screwed by an angry Thor. Good if unique taste, rather a sweet note. Has good legs, at 5 to 6. Definitely worth getting when possible. Extraordinary body effects for a sativa. Get some and have intimate relations with the God of Thunder today!\u201d \u2013 doobwalker\n\n\n\u201cLeaping caribou, Batman! If this bud doesn\u2019t embody the cold, rugged, wintery majesty that is the Alaskan wilderness, then I dont know what does. With notes of pine trees and freedom, this kush is optimum for white water rafting, eating a raw salmon, fighting a bear, or a combination of the three. Would ride a dog sled for miles in the dead of winter to get ahold of this weed. As in the words of the Eskimos this is some \u2018\u02c8t\u0283akna\u03c7 \u02c8hwa\u0281i\u03c7\u2019.\u201d \u2013\u00a0wespeterson24\n\nLead image:\u00a0Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation",

            "text": "It\u2019s important to celebrate our heroes. Real or imaginary, these men and women help us define our ideal selves. Sometimes these heroes are imbued with superhuman abilities, like the power of flight or telepathy, but much of the time, the attributes that make a superhero are inherently human. Heroes are characters that stand up for the weak and defenseless. They go beyond the call to raise up their fellow man. Heroes are not indestructible, but simply willing to give more of themselves without the need of thanks or admiration.\nYes, heroes are among us and within us, and on this day devoted to Superman, the \u00dcbermensch, I\u2019ve curated a shortlist of strains that will imbue you with superhuman sensations that will hopefully enable you to do something heroic\u2026or at least conquer the villainous forces of laziness and depression. Up, up, and away!\n\u00a0\nAllen Wrench\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis strain is pow!!! Gets you a super uplifting high with a great taste and smooth smoke not very harsh at all even when the bowl is almost ass and still tastes good and the smell is unbelievable super earthy citrus and could smell it from across my house, great strain won\u2019t regret.\u201d \u2013 sillbillybro\n\u00a0\nMaui\n\u00a0\n\u201cBeautiful strain came on subtle and took over my whole body for a wonderful ride. I have permanent nerve damage due to an IED this stuff makes me feel like superman.\u201d \u2013 Dungy51\n\u00a0\nKryptonite\n\n\u201cYup. So that\u2019s what Superman feels like when he is flying. I got a top shelf, frosty, extra strength dose of this stuff. I hit in a vape\u2026 Pure, tasty and then BOOM! This stuff is no joke. . .tread lightly.\u201d \u2013 Rhobert\n\u00a0\nSuperman OG\n \n\u201cFaster than a speeding bowl-hit, more powerful than locomotive, it\u2019s Superman OG! This wax is dank. Be sure to get it while it lasts at Delta-9 Association in San Jose.\u201d \u2013 tgigrass\n\u00a0\nIncredible Hulk\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery tasty, high energy strain. Perfect morning smoke to get your day started and the creative juices flowing, but smoke any more than a bowl and it hits you like a train with an incredibly strong cerebral high. Oh, and have some snacks ready because this shit is guaranteed to give you some extreme munchies.\u201d \u2013 absentia882\n\u00a0\nChemdawg\n\u00a0\n\u201c8/10: I like this one a lot. She\u2019s very much like an OG Kush but more leaning on the lighter side in terms of effects. She\u2019s not gonna get ya stoned out ya brains, but what she does offer you is a nice full body high and the ability to eat 1,467,279 cheeseburgers and fries. So smile, relax, and just know everything\u2019s gonna be just fine J\u201d \u2013 beelzebub\n\u00a0\nCinderella 99\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2018I am, I am, I am Superman, and I can do anything\u2019\u2026 are not just lyrics from the R.E.M. song, but that\u2019s how you will feel after smoking Cinderella 99. I felt like Superman flying over Market Street in San Francisco. It was an uplifting feeling. When I came back down to earth, I got wobbly legs and a pretty bad case of paranoia, all the people on the sidewalk with their shopping bags, the street performers were making me feel dizzy. That lasted maybe five minutes, then I felt like that first time you got baked, I mean really high. Time slows down, and you feel like everyone in the world knows you\u2019re high. Fun times. I highly recommend for absolutely eliminating anxiety, stress, and aches and pains, just don\u2019t overdo it. Go easy with this one.\u201d \u2013 blackhawks15\n\u00a0\nWhile these strains might not make you leap over a building in a single bound, shoot lasers out of your eyes, or tear a phone book in half, they should pack a physical stimulation that encourages a sense of wellbeing that traverses the sativa/hybrid/indica continuum. Each strain is suited for a series of semi-heroic deeds that may include making a cape out of bed sheets or other household objects, jumping on a trampoline while wearing said cape, and donning a fist-forward flying motion while walking/running anywhere. Go forth, do good, and live on!\n\u201cI\u2019m not a prophet or a stone aged man, just a mortal with potential of a superman. I\u2019m living on.\u201d \u2013 David Bowie",
