            "text": "The Leafly Explorer was just updated with some new strains, and we'd like to hear from those of you who have given them a try! Is Jesus as miraculous as it sounds, and does Pine Tar really smell like a forest of pine trees? Share your thoughts in a strain review!\nIf any of these new varieties catches your eye, be sure to bookmark or \"favorite\" the strain on your Leafly app and look out for its availability near you!\n\u00a0\n 1. Pine Tar Kush\n\nPine Tar Kush stems from a family of pure indica genetics native to Pakistan. This cannabis strain is nearly unaltered from its original genetic form and expresses itself with bright green hues and a skunky aroma. The rich Kush flavor of pine mixes with sweet undertones that give way to Pine Tar Kush\u2019s calming yet talkative buzz.\n\n\u00a0\n 2. Jesus\n\nJesus, not to be confused with Jesus OG, is a Seattle staple grown by Solstice. This hybrid is a cross between White Widow and Blue Dynamite, a combination that gives rise to pungent, resin-loaded buds that smell of sweet lemon and herbs. Its cerebrally-focused effects give way to happy moods and outbursts of giggles, with soothing full-body relaxation trailing close behind.\n\n\u00a0\n 3. Astroboy\n\nAstroboy is an energetic, sativa-dominant hybrid cannabis strain that combines Apollo 13 genetics with a cross of Ortega and Cinderella 99 bred by TGA Subcool Seeds. A mix of sweet and sour fruit flavors, like citrus and cherry, lead the way towards a heady buzz that is fast-acting and uplifting. The cerebral energy sparked by Astroboy is a great choice to keep you happy and active throughout a busy day. The watermelon phenotype of Astroboy is known to be an exceptional expression of the strain and is often desired as an influence for other breeding projects.\n\n\u00a0\n 4. Sweet Deep Grapefruit\n\nSweet Deep Grapefruit is an indica-dominant cross of Grapefruit and Blueberry genetics, bred by Dinafem Seeds. The intense, relaxing effects of the Sweet Deep Grapefruit cannabis strain are led by a unique fruity flavor and carry a captivating, sweet aroma that lures the senses.\n\n\u00a0\n 5. One to One\n\nNamed for its equal balance of THC and CBD, One to One by CBD Seeds is a stabilized hybrid bred from Amnesia Haze and a high-CBD landrace strain. Its nuanced citrus notes come out strong from the first opening of the jar until the final exhale. With effects that embrace both the mind and body, One to One delivers blissful relaxation that encourages a positive mood. One to One finishes its flowering cycle after 8 to 9 weeks, or in September for outdoor gardens.\n\n\u00a0\n 6. Throwback Kush\n\nThrowback Kush is an indica-dominant cannabis strain bred by Exotic Genetix. It is a combination of an old-school OG Kush mother from the 1990s and a Green Ribbon BX (backcross) father. The resulting hybrid creates a mix of citrus flavors with a sharp, pungent note that is reminiscent of Pinesol and gives way to relaxing indica effects that are balanced by a dash of uplifting sativa energy.\n\n\u00a0\n 7. Double Dutch\n\nDouble Dutch is a classic hybrid strain bred by Magus Genetics who crossed a pre-2000 Chronic female with a Warlock father. This 60/40 indica-dominant split has a strong Dutch heritage with emphasized indica traits. In its vegetative cycle, Double Dutch erupts into a bushy plant with thick leaves and strong stems, while its flowering stage gives rise to sativa-like popcorn buds after 8 to 9 weeks. With an aroma that brings to mind fresh fruit and fields of wildflowers, Double Dutch is cherished for its powerfully relaxing effects that flood both body and mind without causing too much drowsiness.\n\n\u00a0",

            "text": "Very nice! A great strain for end-of-the-day relaxation and pain. Slight cerebral stimulation to start with, then a long, satisfying, relaxing body stone and calming of the mind. Works wonders for post operative pain (I'm currently recuperating for surgery) and arthritic pain (my wife uses this strain for this reason). It has an unusual, but not unpleasant aroma; reminiscent of grapefruit peel and tyre smoke with hints of skunk and sage. An easy-to-grow strain with a medium resistance to thrips and a high resistance to mildew. Not too pungent when being flowered, unless the plant is moved or brushed up against. Overall a very nice strain with great medical potential.",
