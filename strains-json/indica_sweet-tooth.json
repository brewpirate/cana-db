            "text": "Honey is an amazing substance \u2014 it\u2019s a natural sweetener, a super-food with a nearly endless shelf life (if sealed properly), and has\u00a0outstanding nutritional and medicinal benefits that can even help people adapt to local allergens (not to mention how delicious it is on baklava, peanut butter sandwiches, and in a cup of hot coffee or tea!).\nLeafly is home to over 60\u00a0specific strains that exhibit notes of honey. As your strain researcher and a passionate purveyor of fine cannabis, I\u2019ve curated a shortlist of honey-flavored strains that will make your fingers sticky and your taste buds smile. Enjoy!\n\u00a0 \u00a0Panama Red\nPanama Red is best described as an old-school cannabis classic. Originating from Panama, this pure sativa rose to stardom in the late 1960\u2019s thanks to its typical sativa effects: speedy and intense, bordering on psychedelic. As cannabis cultivation matured, Panama Red, which has a lengthy flowering time of at least 11 weeks, was left behind for faster growing strains and increased profits. However, those who fondly recall days of its prominence love its smooth medicating experience and loftily contemplate its revival. If you can get your hands on this sentimental throwback, do not hesitate to groove down memory lane and enjoy the ride.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Chocolate Thunder\nWhen you combine the sweet cocoa flavor of Chocolope with the strength and potency of\u00a0Alaskan Thunder Fuck, you get none other than Chocolate Thunder. This clear-headed, active\u00a0sativa may be all you need to inspire creativity or promote concentration, and patients will appreciate its ability to dull symptoms without fogging mental faculties. True to its name, Chocolate Thunder has a subtle sweet, earthy aroma similar to that of chocolate.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Thor\u2019s Hammer\nThor\u2019s Hammer by SnowHigh Seeds is an uplifting sativa strain that combines genetics from\u00a0Vortex, Cinderella 99, and Acapulco Gold. Like a bolt of lightning commanded by the Norse god himself, Thor\u2019s Hammer delivers an electrifying blast of cerebral energy that awakens\u00a0creativity and motivation. Its lightweight body effects make this strain a great choice for daytime use, and patients needing to crush fatigue and depression like the giants of Jotunheimr will likely find Thor\u2019s Hammer to be the perfect weapon. You may also find a\u00a0genetic variant of Thor\u2019s Hammer from Alaska\u00a0that instead\u00a0combines God Bud and Sour Diesel\u00a0in a more balanced indica-sativa hybrid cross.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Honey Banana\nHoney Bananas from Elemental Seeds is a heavy-handed hybrid strain bred from Strawberry Banana and Honey Boo Boo. This cannabis strain earns its name with a resinous coat as sticky as honey and an unmistakable banana aroma. She leans heavily toward the indica side of the family, providing weighty full-body effects coupled with an invigorating buzz of cerebral euphoria.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Lodi Dodi\nLodi Dodi is a sativa-dominant hybrid popular in Washington State. Exclusively bred by The Clone Zone, the genetic heritage of Lodi Dodi is undefined and closely guarded. Lodi Dodi carries a sweet, unique flavor of tropical fruit and fresh wildflowers. The pungent aroma leads the way towards a cerebral buzz, known to spark creativity and a boost of energy that will turn any task into a more enjoyable adventure.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Nebula\nThe Nebula marijuana strain was bred by Paradise Seeds in 1996. Its name means \u201cStarcloud\u201d and it has been known to \u201ctwinkle\u201d with THC coating, with a head and body buzz described as intense and almost psychedelic. The buds have been known to smell and taste like honey, and flowering time is a minimum of 9 weeks. Nebula has won many awards, including 3rd place in the sativa category at the High Times Cannabis Cup in 1999 and 2nd place in 2005. It also took 3rd place at the Highlife Cup in 2004 in the Hydro category, and 1st place at the Copa La Bella Flor Spain in 2005.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Fortune Cookies\nFortune Cookies is a hybrid cannabis strain that combines the famed genetics of GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) and OG Kush in a potent mix of earthy, honeyed flavors. OG Kush genes are already present in GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), but Fortune Cookies has pronounced characteristics that OG fans will appreciate. Sativa genetics usually lead the way with Fortune Cookies, inducing a soaring, long-lasting buzz perfect for creative escapes. This hybrid can hit hard in larger doses, pushing past the confines of a subtle buzz into the weighty \u201ccouch-lock\u201d effects typically associated with indica strains.\n\u00a0 \u00a0BC Sweet Tooth\nDeveloped in British Columbia by BC Bud Depot, BC Sweet tooth is an indica-dominant hybrid known for its quick flowering time and candy taste. \u00a0A hardy plant, this strain can be grown outdoors where it can flower in under 7 weeks, but it prefers the indoors where it may flower as soon as 6 weeks. The result of a cross with earlier generations of BC Sweet Tooth and classic\u00a0Sweet Tooth, these sugary flowers are sure to satisfy your craving. The crystalline buds have a strong, sweet smell with a hint of citrus, and consumers\u00a0report that this treat satisfies with a long-lasting, potent feeling that hits fast.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Danky Doodle\nOriginally named Double D as a reference to the large buds on these plants (we\u2019ll let you make the connection there), breeder KC Brains decided to rename the strain Danky Doodle at the suggestion of some American friends in order to avoid confusion with the similarly named Double Dutch. Danky Doodle certainly isn\u2019t a shy plant; it grows like the weed it is and will make its presence known with its pungent sweet smell. Plants flower at 9 to 11 weeks and should provide a high yield of large buds covered in a rich frost. This plant is a cross between several strains, and it\u2019s no surprise that Big Bud is included in its lineage along with the strains Viking and the breeder\u2019s own KC 636. The result is a strong indica that provides full body relief no matter what you call it.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Cream Caramel\nCream Caramel, named after its sweet caramel aroma, is a 90% indica cross between BlueBlack, Maple Leaf Indica, and White Rhino. Covered in a sugary coat of THC-rich resin, Cream Caramel delivers heavy, relaxing indica effects that soothe the mind and body. Though originally bred by Sweet Seeds in Spain, Royal Queen Seeds have also championed their own rendition called Royal Caramel. Early October is the finish line for outdoor Cream Caramel flowers, while indoor gardens should be harvested after a 7 to 8 week flowering period.",

Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Sweet Tooth is an indica-dominant strain that was created by crossing three landrace strains in the early 2000s. Stemming from Afghani, Nepalese, and Hawaiian genetics, this award-winning strain has a sweet and fruity flavor, and its effects are deeply relaxing and euphoric.\nGrow Techniques: Sweet Tooth is as enjoyable to grow as it is to consume. It offers heavy yields while also being a low-maintenance plant. It is generally pest-resistant and has a strong immune system. Grow this strain indoors or outdoors, and prune the dense indica foliage to promote airflow around the buds.\nFlowering Time: 8 to 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Easy\nClimate: Sweet Tooth likes a cooler climate than most strains. Ideally, keep this strain between 68 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: This strain grows well either indoors or outdoors.\u00a0\nFeeding: Feed heavily during the vegetative stage to encourage a quality growth structure and to help the plant develop before its flowering cycle. Use silica to help keep the branches strong as Sweet Tooth\u2019s buds gain weight.",

            "text": "I kinda expected this to be similar to bubblegum or cream caramel. But the taste is less sweet. It has a resinous pine taste, sweet and lightly woody, but not too harsh. The smell is rather sharp so it's hard to tell any aromas with a joint. On the effects side: I have never felt so relaxed in my life. I felt the indica effects sneaking in, while I got happier and my stressful thoughts disappeared, which was a while ago. I'm in my backyard, lit a candle, ate a hotdog, watched slow mo videos on YouTube. Felt amazing, content, but not anxious or uneasy. I was overwhelmed when I lit the 2nd, but a few minutes later I got the hang of it. Physically couchlocked, clear headed and positive mindset. In smaller quantities (or temperature if you're vaping) you have more of the latter, maybe even somewhat sativa leaning effects. Also great to chill with friends and play Xbox very, very badly, which is always a great indicator for the stone-o-meter. Deserves its five stars.",
