    "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Tangerine Kush embodies the California sunshine. This cannabis&nbsp;strain got its name for both its citrusy flavor and its halo of bright orange hairs covering the bud. While the effects of this indica are particularly short-lasting, Tangerine Kush is potent with a quick onset. Providing consumers with a happy, body-heavy sensation, this strain is great for those looking for a lazy day at the beach. Tangerine Kush&rsquo;s effects are felt more in the head than many other indicas. Upon first taste, consumers may feel uplifted and energized. After a few minutes, however, a heavy, lazy sensation kicks in. If you&rsquo;re looking for a strain to help you relax, Tangerine Kush may be worth a try.</p>\n",
