            "text": "Initial impression: I saw this strain sitting in its glass jar with almost an oily bluish sheen to it. Come to find out it was such dark blue and purple that the light being bounced off gave this strain an oily sheen to it, kinda neat if you ask me. I was excited to see a strain with such varying phenotype distinctiveness and displays. My initial impression was of some wonder and a little marveling over the aesthetics of this strain.\n\nI use a scale of 10 points, 10 being the highest possible score in any category, with 3 total categories, Taste / Aroma / Potency.\n\nAroma: 5.5\nThe aroma is reminiscent of a light piney, spicy, earthy pungent-ness. The aroma was okay, was really light ans subtle, which was nice. Nothing really special.\n\nTaste: 7.5\nThe taste of this bud was something quite different than its scent. Like the aroma, the taste was also light.  The initial taste of this is more earthy and piney than its smell leads you to believe. The taste of this bud was okay, left me wanting more flavor. I am not saying this is bad, I am also not impressed, this strain was okay for a middle of the week night toke.\n\nPotency: 7.0\nThe strength of this euphoria was like everything else about this strain just okay. This strain had a THC rating in the high teens, either I am smoking way to much and can't really feel feelings anymore, or this was a weaker plant. Ill try it again just to make sure it was a fluke.\n\n\nFinal opinion: I thought this strain was just okay. This is one of those strains that is average. I have read the genetic info based on this Indica cross, and was thinking that with genetics from which this plant hails, it was the runt of the littler (just my thought). This is an okay strain to take part in as a newbie.\n\nTotal points awarded: 20 out of 30 better than average but far from awesome.\n\nCM~",
