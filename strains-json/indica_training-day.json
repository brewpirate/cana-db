A 50/50 hybrid, Cherry OG truly brings you the best of both sativa and indica worlds as it delivers full-body euphoria alongside high-flying cerebral lucidity.

WSU\n\nWSU is a Washington-grown rendition of the indica strain Chemo and it\u2019s waiting for you on the shelves of recreational stores state-wide. Named in homage to Washington State University, don\u2019t confuse this strain with the UW indica, whose name is derived from the rivaling University of Washington. Its effects are described as relaxed and spacey. Citrus and berry flavors invade the palate on the inhale, providing a flavorful introduction to WSU\u2019s heavy indica effects.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying WSU\n\u00a0\n 3. Tommy's Home Grown\n\nTommy\u2019s Home Grown, or THG for short, is a balanced hybrid strain that falls under the \u201cChong Certified\u201d label.

NL5 Haze Mist\n\nNL5 Haze Mist by Green House Seeds is a classic sativa-dominant strain that mixes genetics from Northern Lights #5, Haze, and Kali Mist.

This sativa brings a newfound vibrancy to the senses, allowing you to unlock creativity and appreciation of your surroundings.\n\n\u00a0\n 5. SinMint Cookies\n\nSinMint Cookies is Sin City Seeds\u2019 signature hybrid cross between GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) and Blue Power.

Training Day\n\nBred by DNA Genetics, Training Day is a 70% indica that combines parent strains Trainwreck and LA Confidential. This California native takes after its LA Confidential parent in aroma and delivers a pungent earthy and pine flavor.

OG Chem\n\nOG Chem, also called Chem OG, is a sativa-dominant cross between two legendary strains, Chemdawg and OG Kush.

            "text": "Notice the head high first, like wearing a baseball hat. Very slow come on mentally, but once it starts, you can really feel it billowing and consuming your mental ability. It takes over your head in a really potent way - could be easy to do too much! Brain feels like it\u2019s wrapped in a warm, family blanket. Not just suppressed, but elevates your mood and makes you feel good; both emotionally and physically. A euphoria starts to swell out of your chest and lift you to almost childlike spirits. Despite it disabling your brain a noticeable degree, you maintain a clarity and a balanced degree of lightness. A pretty nuanced, intense, but enjoyable high. I noticed while watching movies they may be interesting, but not the most engaging. The high\u2019s positivity might limit the amount of feels you could get from stuff, music, etc. That\u2019s a pretty big tradeoff for me, but am still glad I got to ride this experience. Definitely worth trying, at least, but unsure of its diversity of uses. Perhaps video games? Outdoors/walks (it doesn\u2019t seem prone to couch lock yet) and the uplifting nature makes socializing enriching.",
