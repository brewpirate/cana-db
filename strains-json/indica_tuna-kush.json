This strain has been deemed one of the most potent available, producing small, dense nuggets that are hard-caked with resin. Although Tuna Kush is not known for its large yield, what does come off these thinner stalks will be rich with potency and flavor. That being said, if this strain makes it to your grow, upgrade your carbon filters&nbsp;because this bud is stinky! Expect notes of pungent skunk, fuel, and a delicate sweetness intermixed.</p>\n",

The buds are super dense and smell just like tuna with a side of kushy skunk. After smoking a bowl, the lower half of my body felt like it was filled with sand (woooo!) and all pain, mental and physical, was numbed. Perfect weed to help you forget Americans just elected a pussy-grabber to the Presidency.",
