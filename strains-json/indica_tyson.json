            "text": "FLEMINGTON, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 A company owned by former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is teaming up with a West Virginia cannabis farm.\nNews outlets report officials announced Monday that Tyson Holistic and West Virginia\u2019s Almost Heaven Agriculture are partnering to put a hemp extraction facility at the latter\u2019s existing greenhouse.\n\nTyson Holistic Chief Operating Officer Kevin Bell says they chose an existing license holder for a joint venture, as the state only gives licenses twice a year. He touted the uses of medicinal hemp, which retails for a higher price than industrial hemp, but says the state currently has no extraction facility.\nBell says the company plans to invest \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d in the West Virginia hemp industry. The company is also looking at reclamation land to grow crops.",

Sweet Pebbles\n\nSweet Pebbles, bred by Fire Bros. in Washington, is an aromatic hybrid strain with uplifting, happy effects. Those of you who love the strains Fruity Pebbles and Sour Pebbles are likely to appreciate the similar flavor profile of Sweet Pebbles, whose aroma is more floral than that of its sour-smelling relatives. Be prepared for Sweet Pebbles\u2019 dreamy euphoria to lull your body into elevated relaxation while the mind wanders freely with creativity and focus.\n\nSweet Pebbles is available at Have a Heart Cafe in Seattle, WA\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. B.B. King\n\nB.B. King, named in honor of the Blues musician and songwriter, is an indica-dominant strain bred by MTG Seeds that crosses Blackberry Kush and Space Monster. A sweet and earthy flavor ushers in B.B. King\u2019s sedating effects, which lull both body and mind into deep relaxation. If sleep doesn\u2019t hit you first, be prepared to address a ravenous appetite. This indica typically blooms with dark purple-tipped flowers, highlighting its contrasting blanket of white crystal resin.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. CBD Mango Haze\n\nCBD Mango Haze is a high-CBD strain released by CBD Crew in 2013. This pleasant and aromatic blend combines the tropical flavors of Mango Haze with the added benefits from high levels of cannabidiol. The buds of CBD Mango Haze express themselves with spicy and sweet notes reminiscent of mango, pineapple, and black pepper. Its CBD:THC ratio can range anywhere from 1:1 \u2013 2:1 and the uplifting sativa-dominant effects draw many medical cannabis consumers to CBD Mango Haze.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Blue Wreck\n\nBlue Wreck, also called Blueberry Trainwreck, is a hybrid strain primarily led by its sativa influence. A cross between Blueberry and Trainwreck, Blue Wreck\u2019s flavor is a complex mix of sweet berry, sour fruit, and tangy skunk. Its effects are typically described as clear-headed and active, with a burst of calm euphoria that can help you maintain a positive outlook throughout the day.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Tyson\n\nNamed after former undisputed heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, this strain is sure to knock you out. With a pungent diesel aroma, Tyson delivers a punch of indica effects known to fully relax the body while dulling pain, stress, insomnia, and appetite loss. This strain is not intended for first time users, and should only be consumed by indica connoisseurs. Tyson has been Canna Clinic's signature strain since its inauguration in 2011.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Summertime Squeeze\n\nSummertime Squeeze is a sativa-dominant strain whose aroma brings to mind fresh citrus and tropical fruit. Its high-energy, active effects make it a perfect choice for getting outside, socializing, or indulging in creative activities.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Scott's OG\n\nScott\u2019s OG is an indica-dominant hybrid strain bred by Rare Dankness Seeds, who crossed Triangle Kush with their Rare Dankness #1 to create this prominent OG variety. Designed with the veteran in mind, Scott\u2019s OG has potently euphoric effects that a novice or occasional consumer might find jarring. A thick blanket of crystal trichomes covers its buds like a fur coat, which should serve as a warning of this strain\u2019s intense effects. True to its OG heritage, Scott\u2019s OG gives off an earthy, sour aroma that is sweetened by citrusy lemon flavors.",
