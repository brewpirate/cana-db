            "text": "Rhythm and Blues is a rich genre with roots planted firmly in the black American community. It is a genre synonymous with emotion\u2014music that feeds the soul and tells stories of pain and love. Born in the 1940s, R&B has evolved over the decades to mean different things during different times while covering other genres such as gospel, funk, hip hop, and soul.\n\nDiverse as it is, there is a rich plethora of R&B to explore and appreciate. While the genre may encompass many elements, R&B will always be known for radiating feeling and heart. As R&B artist Kenny \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds says, \u201cR&B is the one thing that has influenced every kind of music.\u201d Pack a bowl and turn up these five powerful R&B albums to electrify your next smoke session.\nWoman by Jill Scott\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Ultraviolet OG\nJill Scott\u2019s album\u00a0Woman\u00a0marks her fifth and latest release.

Her song \u201cShot Down\u201d addresses police brutality against black Americans with lyrics like \u201cShot down on display in the middle of the story / She was shot down in the park in the middle of the day,\u201d and \u201cThe System says we matter, but the black lives only / Matter certain days.\u201d Ledisi combines these raw, real lyrics with her powerful, soulful voice, and exquisite instrumentals make it all sound effortless\u2014though it is anything but.\n\nFunk This by Chaka Khan\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Mother of Berries\nLegendary \u201cQueen of Funk\u201d singer/songwriter and talented drummer Chaka Khan has been producing music for five decades, incorporating funk, jazz, and soul influences.

From high-energy tracks such as \u201cDisrespectful\u201d to soulful ballads such as \u201cAngel,\u201d Funk This is an immersive album that demonstrates why Khan is called Queen.\nThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill by Ms. Lauryn Hill\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Punky Lion\nLauryn Hill\u2019s first solo album, released in 1998, gained wide spread acclaim and went on to break records. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is a hard-hitting and expertly assembled album featuring Lauryn Hill\u2019s unique mix of beauty and boldness.

            "text": "Check out the cannabis strains recently added to the Leafly database! While they might be new to our strain Explorer, many of them have been circulating the market for a while now. If you've come across some of them before, write a strain review!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Honey Bananas\n\nHoney Bananas from Elemental Seeds is a heavy-handed hybrid strain bred from Strawberry Banana and Honey Boo Boo. This cannabis strain earns its name with a resinous coat as sticky as honey and an unmistakable banana aroma. She leans heavily toward the indica side of the family, providing weighty full-body effects coupled with an invigorating buzz of cerebral euphoria.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a02. Papa's OG\n\nCultivated in Glendale, Arizona exclusively by Arizona Organix, Papa\u2019s OG is an indica cannabis strain that provides positive and uplifting cerebral effects in unique combination with the classic indica full-body relaxation. Consumers find it to be functional and social while still remaining true to its indica roots. A descendant of\u00a0Skywalker OG\u00a0and\u00a0OG Kush, Papa\u2019s OG inherits a sweet and earthy grape aroma and potent medicinal effects suitable for patients treating pain, insomnia, and stress disorders.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Sin Valley OG\n\nSin Valley OG is a 60/40 indica-dominant cannabis strain bred by Sin City Seeds, who crossed SFV OG with a Blue Power indica. The resulting hybrid boasts high yields and well-structured buds with an earthy and sour lemon aroma. Beginning with a crushing blast of cerebral euphoria, Sin Valley OG brings an edge to your appetite while coercing muscles into serene relaxation.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. LA Chocolat\n\nLA Chocolate, bred by DNA Genetics, is a 60/40 indica-dominant strain parented by their cherished LA Confidential indica and Chocolope sativa. This power-couple collectively passes on the best of their qualities: thick resin production, heavy yields, and a sweet, earthy aroma of chocolate and coffee. Its soothing physical effects sink through the body, keeping you relaxed while kindling the appetite.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a05. UltraViolet OG\n\nFrom Archive Seeds, UltraViolet OG is an 80% indica strain bred by crossing Face Off OG with Purple Indica from the Pacific Northwest. With this genetic combination, the breeders hoped to improve the yield and flowering time while still maintaining a deep purple coloration, and UltraViolet OG achieved just that. This powerful indica strain delivers dreamy, sleepy euphoria that grants your eyelids some heaviness at night while giving your mood a burst of positivity.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Jimi Hendrix\n\nThere are many genetic combinations that fall under the name Jimi Hendrix, but this southern Oregon hybrid descends from Jack Herer, Headband, and Black Cherry Soda. Led by its sativa genetics, Jimi Hendrix delivers a cerebrally focused jolt of euphoric energy that helps feed creativity and focus in low doses. In a show of its diverse\u00a0terpene profile, Jimi Hendrix has a complex aroma that spans flavors from earthy pine to sweet lemon and citrus.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. RudeBoi OG\n\nBred by Archive Seeds, RudeBoi OG is an indica-dominant hybrid cannabis strain that brings together genetics from two OG Kush phenotypes, Irene OG\u00a0and a backcrossed\u00a0Face Off OG. The hashy kush aroma typically found in OG varieties comes out strong in this hybrid, providing a flavorful introduction with a refreshing finish. RudeBoi OG produces potently sublime, relaxing effects that envelopes both mind and body.\n\n\u00a0\nCheck out our other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or catch up on last week's recently added strains!",
