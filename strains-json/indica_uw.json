Got it from a student that knew someone growing it for the UW and of course it got around to a few select groups. The stuff going around now is some purple strain that\u0027s been mixed into it, possibly and it\u0027s called UW Purple. The original was lime green, had an extremely Indica buzz and had a real light piney taste. It was super light weight buds, that were very dense though, not airy at all. It gave you a very heavy feeling behind the eyes and you could eat 3 Dicks Deluxe with fries, tartars and a Chocolate Shake, no problem. That\u0027s why they called it Cancer research weed. Chemo patients were able to eat.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"},{"id":1610050,"username":"dankshydro","text":"Farm: Blue Roots \nTotal Cannaboids: 15.79%\nTerpenes: 2.60%\nWhat a beautiful bud with lots of purple.
