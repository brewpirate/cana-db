Popular rumor has it that&nbsp;a clone plant was stolen from a certain Pacific Northwest university&#39;s medical research lab in the early nineties&mdash;in some versions by a rogue graduate student&mdash;and has since been a popular top shelf indica. These buds show their university pride with purple coloring, and the dense, sticky buds are at the top of the class when it comes to potency. Almost entirely indica, this strain&rsquo;s powerful high is sedative and popular for pain relief and insomnia. A mix of tropical fruit and a little spice, the aroma also earns high marks.</p>\n",

Got it from a student that knew someone growing it for the UW and of course it got around to a few select groups. The stuff going around now is some purple strain that's been mixed into it, possibly and it's called UW Purple. The original was lime green, had an extremely Indica buzz and had a real light piney taste. It was super light weight buds, that were very dense though, not airy at all. It gave you a very heavy feeling behind the eyes and you could eat 3 Dicks Deluxe with fries, tartars and a Chocolate Shake, no problem. That's why they called it Cancer research weed. Chemo patients were able to eat.",
