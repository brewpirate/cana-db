            "text": "Tilray patient review:\nWatermelon smell/flavour definitely there.\nThe euphoria in this strain is intense for an indica. It is uplifting and energizing. I don't feel sleepy and I can do a variety of activities and not feel couch locked. I prefer to use it during the day, not the evening.\nI don't really notice the typical indica body effects until the euphoria fully sets in. Once it does it provides me with moderate pain relief and muscle relaxation.\nOther than providing a great euphoria I find this strain is also a huge anxiety killer for me.\nOver all I would definitely order this strain again. It's a shame this is a limited release from Tilray. The smell and taste alone make it worth keeping as a regular item. I enjoy having a good daytime indica that provides a sativa like euphoria.",
