            "text": "My favorite Indica hands down!! I use a 300MG per ML \"Pure\" liquid of this that I get from the CT medical program. I've been anxiously waiting for the day that this showed up on Leafly. \n\nThis is a HARD HITTER!!! When I started to smoke this it absolute bliss. My mind would calm and my tense muscles would relax. \n\nI started to use it everyday at home as it was to strong to use out and about. I was amazed at how much this strain helps my muscle spasticity issues and my neurological pain issues. You can just feel your body turning into a pile of wonderful mush. I often smoke this and focus on different areas and try to relax the muscles even more.\n\nThis would often make my have to take a long nap when I used it at first. I've used this to help sleep and relax in many situations. I can't say enough that this is a heavy Indica with a great body relaxing effect and a super strong mind relaxing effect.\n\nThis is the closest I've felt to prescribed benzodiazepine or a muscle relaxer in the marijuana lexicon. \n\nI use it very often at home or when I don't need to do anything that takes much effort. I smoke some wax or shatter and then take some puffs of this to enhance the muscle and mind relaxation and that helps as well.\n\n\nI really think this is the gold standard in medical marijuana. Please please if you suffer from any legitimate medical problem I think you'll find this helpful \n\nAnd if your just using it for fun it will get you just right. \n\n",

I feel like my pain is just numbed and I have a permanent smile on my face(or food in my hand). It takes away the fear and the pain, which are the reasons I don't go out much. I have Spinal stenosis so I feel self conscious when I do go out...HOWEVER, when I'm on WB I'm sociable, and relaxed in social situations. If I could rate it 6 stars I would.",
