Don\u0027t get me wrong I\u0027m still stressed out, nothing makes reality stop happening, but I am far calmer, and able to think in a straight line again. \nEffects were near to instant, but not over powering, and I\u0027m feeling sleepy after my panic attack (which is normal as they\u0027re exhausting!) but not sedated or lethargic. \nThis is a must toke!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"},{"id":1633626,"username":"mrgilley123","text":"trying this for the first time and giving it.
