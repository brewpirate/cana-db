I have this and Love Potion #1 on hand currently, and they are both amazing, but this is the best I've ever smoked for my panic attacks hands down. I was in the throws of my worst panic attack in a long time not a half an hour ago and after one round through my vape, I'm totally level. Don't get me wrong I'm still stressed out, nothing makes reality stop happening, but I am far calmer, and able to think in a straight line again. \nEffects were near to instant, but not over powering, and I'm feeling sleepy after my panic attack (which is normal as they're exhausting!) but not sedated or lethargic. \nThis is a must toke!",
