But then I got a hang for it's sedating effects, tingly feeling (was was months ago sadly). Enthousiastic, giggly, happy but no deep thoughts. Everything dark seems nearly black, lights behind the windows shine extra bright. curled up curtains look weird, like holograms, time travel, 45 minutes to roll number 2. Wasn't necessary, but pleasant nonetheless. Stoned and zoned out, fingers dance in the light of the screen while typing.  Jade-ish green with thick brown hairs and clearly visible crystals. When broken up it looks somewhere between grass-green and something lighter. Pretty cool weed.",
