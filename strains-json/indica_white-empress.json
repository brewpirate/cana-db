            "text": "when opening the pack, the strain gives off a real earthy piney smell, kinda like the fresh scent of pine oil lol. bud is very frosty  with light green and dark green leaves with orange hairs. Real smooth smoke when inhaled. no harshness but still gives off that loud sativa smell similar to a strong rain forest perfume. Makes you feel uplifted in the mind in the aspects of creativity and deep thought. Good for brainstorming and active production. Also feel light of my feet as if i was gliding or floating. I recommend for day time use.  Mine tested 26.9% in total THC so very potent. ",

Great to relieve body aches and pains, not so great for socializing or being out in public due to the strong anxiety that set in. ",
