            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and\u00a0General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: White Rhino is prized as a medicinal strain thanks to its heavy body high that helps wipe out aches and pains. It was developed by Green House Seeds, who crossed landrace strains from Afghanistan, Brazil, and South India. When grown properly, it will produce large yields of resinous, pine-scented buds.\nGrow Techniques: A hydroponic setup can result in a stronger, bushier shape with less spacing between the nodes than with outdoor growing. It\u2019s perfect for an indoor SOG (sea of green) setup where space is limited.\nFlowering Time: 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Keep between 68-80 degrees Fahrenheit. White Rhino does best in a well-controlled environment with consistent day and nighttime temperatures.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Indoor growing produces the best yields, but White Rhino also grows well outdoors.\nFeeding: Heavy feeding helps the plant develop its full bushy shape. Use nitrogen-focused nutrients white the plant is vegging.",
