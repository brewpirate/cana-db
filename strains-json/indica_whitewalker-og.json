            "text": "\ud83e\udd16\ud83c\udf7b White Walker O.G. from Cannabiotix is a sinister treat to the O.G. world. She is potent, beautiful, super sticky, and downright dank. It's hard to go wrong with an O.G. if it was grown and cured properly. This is such a great strain for putting your mind at ease. She smells of a fresh cut lawn mixed with the most sour pine cone you've ever smelt. That classic O.G. scent resonates strong with this one. Such a nice display of trichomes and the buds are nice. Would recommend this one for evening use, as it did sedate me a little bit. I absolutely love the cerebral effects.
