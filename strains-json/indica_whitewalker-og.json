She is potent, beautiful, super sticky, and downright dank. It\u0027s hard to go wrong with an O.G. if it was grown and cured properly. This is such a great strain for putting your mind at ease. She smells of a fresh cut lawn mixed with the most sour pine cone you\u0027ve ever smelt. That classic O.G. scent resonates strong with this one. Such a nice display of trichomes and the buds are nice. Would recommend this one for evening use, as it did sedate me a little bit. I absolutely love the cerebral effects.
