Regardless of where you place your finger on cannabis’ evolutionary timeline, a few unforgettable classic strains loom somewhere in the background as deities carved into the “stoned” masonry of the living cannabis pantheon.\nThese strains are genetically and culturally significant touchstones because they give us a glimpse into the not-so-distant past, where strains were transplanted from their countries of origin to be cultivated and refined alongside the history of the counterculture.\nClassic or “old school” strains were not initially bred for potency, but rather for the exotic flavors and effects enjoyed outside the borders of the Western world. As these strains traveled and proliferated, new genetic hybrids were created, intentionally or unintentionally.\n\nThe blending and crossing of transplanted landrace strains led to the explosion of genetic diversity we see today, but before there were even a thousand named strains, the classics gave way to a new generation of cannabis mainstays that fortified their own mythologies and lineages. The “new classics” described below are strains that have grown out from under the shadow of foundational genetics like Haze or Afghani to create robust and unique offspring that are almost as ubiquitous in smoking circles as a Bic lighter.\nHow Potent Are Old School Cannabis Genetics?\nThese classic strains tend to vary by only a percentage or two in terms of average THC levels, but as many of us already know, the terpene profile is where the nuance and uniqueness of a flower is truly expressed. As you’ll see below, these strains also exhibit some similarities in terpene profiles, but ultimately boast a unique composition that sets each one apart.\nClick to enlarge. (Elysse Feigenblatt/Leafly)\nWilly’s Wonder\n\n\nFind Willy’s Wonder Nearby\nWilly’s Wonder (or William’s Wonder) is an old Afghani cut that has seen more pipes than the Mario Bros. This old school beauty produces a sweet, tropical aroma thanks to notable quantities of myrcene, limonene, and linalool. These terpenes also contribute to Willy’s relaxing, yet happy physical buzz that gradually spreads over the consumer.\nCheese \n\n\n \nFind Cheese Nearby\nCheese is the inordinately pungent offspring of Skunk #1, another classic, foundational cannabis strain. Known for its sour and funky aroma, Cheese (also called UK Cheese and Exodus Cheese) made its mark on the palates of yesteryear. While its terpene plot looks somewhat similar to Willy’s Wonder, Cheese retains just enough sweet, floral funk to push the aroma from tropical to gnarly.\nWhite Widow\n\n \n\nFind White Widow Nearby\nWhite Widow firmly stands among the icons of cannabis. This hybrid cross of a Brazilian sativa landrace and a South Indian indica embodies the look and smell of what many consumers recognize as “classic” cannabis. Its semi-sedative effects and pungent earthy aroma lingers in the collective unconscious of lucky ducks who snagged a bag of this fine flower during its pre-legalization heyday.\nSour Diesel\n\n\nFind Sour Diesel Nearby\nWe’ve all encountered that signature acrid fuel aroma native to many cannabis varieties. The Sour Diesel genetic line has imparted its pungent, gassy fragrance to many strains over the years, and has essentially defined one of the many archetypal attributes of dank, potent cannabis.\nAK-47\n\n\n \nFind AK-47 Nearby\nAK-47 was created in the early 90s by blending a variety of landrace genetics together to create something outstanding. With a terpene profile rich in pinene and caryophyllene, AK-47 provides an alert mental state without uppity overstimulation.\nAmnesia Haze\n\n\n \nFind Amnesia Haze Nearby\nAmnesia Haze bridged the gap between the old and new worlds of cannabis. Bred from South Asian and Jamaican landrace genetics, this strain required a degree of globalization to even come into existence. The happy, heady buzz and peppery, tropical aroma of Haze genetics continue to inspire new strains and genetics.\nExplore More Classic Cannabis Strains\nStill jonesing for some timeless cannabis cuts?

After countless hours of organizing pertinent paperwork, filling out tedious forms, searching for a good accountant, and playing everyone’s much-loathed game, “Do I get a refund or do I need to shell out more of my earnings?”, let’s just say things can get a little stressful.\nFortunately, the Leafly team is here to offer your some good news. We’ve compiled a list of seven uber-relaxing strains to help you de-stress.

A potent sativa-dominant hybrid, this little lady is the perfect remedy for all of the headaches and anxiety that comes along with Tax Day.\n  2. Northern Lights\nOne of the most popular indicas, Northern Lights is a classic choice when you’re looking for a little rest and relaxation.

Master Kush is a plucky indica that won the High Times Cannabis Cup back in 1992 and again in 1993, making it a truly old school masterpiece.\n  4. GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\nThough the true stress-relieving qualities of this popular hybrid are only fully expressed when paired with frozen Thin Mints or Tagalongs, GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) is sure to take your mind off of the fact that your new job pushed you up a tax bracket this year. Congratulations! We bet no other promotion has felt quite so bittersweet.\n  5. Skunk #1\nAnother oldie but goodie, Skunk #1 first debuted in 1978 and is sure to take you back to a time when the world was a little simpler: no computer freezing right when you’re about to submit your forms, low risks of identity theft, and no hidden fees taken directly out of your refund by online tax help programs.\n  6. Willy’s Wonder\nIf any of you are like me, you’ve waited until the last possible minute to get your taxes sent in. Willy’s Wonder, an indica-dominant hybrid, is sure to help you get a good night’s sleep once you’ve finally figured out how to get everything submitted via Turbo Tax.\n  7. Mr. Nice\nIn an interview, Seattle attorney Kurt Boehl gave readers a piece of advice: “If you’re going to sell a Schedule One substance, don’t fail to pay your taxes, too.” Named after Howard Marks, one of the largest cannabis smugglers of all time, Mr. Nice is the perfect indica-leaning hybrid to help you celebrate your recent stint as a law-abiding, tax paying citizen.\nWhat’s your go-to strain once you’ve finished filing your tax returns?

Regardless of where you place your finger on cannabis’ evolutionary timeline, a few unforgettable classic strains loom somewhere in the background as deities carved into the “stoned” masonry of the living cannabis pantheon.\nThese strains are genetically and culturally significant touchstones because they give us a glimpse into the not-so-distant past, where strains were transplanted from their countries of origin to be cultivated and refined alongside the history of the counterculture.\nClassic or “old school” strains were not initially bred for potency, but rather for the exotic flavors and effects enjoyed outside the borders of the Western world. As these strains traveled and proliferated, new genetic hybrids were created, intentionally or unintentionally.\n\nThe blending and crossing of transplanted landrace strains led to the explosion of genetic diversity we see today, but before there were even a thousand named strains, the classics gave way to a new generation of cannabis mainstays that fortified their own mythologies and lineages. The “new classics” described below are strains that have grown out from under the shadow of foundational genetics like Haze or Afghani to create robust and unique offspring that are almost as ubiquitous in smoking circles as a Bic lighter.\nHow Potent Are Old School Cannabis Genetics?\nThese classic strains tend to vary by only a percentage or two in terms of average THC levels, but as many of us already know, the terpene profile is where the nuance and uniqueness of a flower is truly expressed. As you’ll see below, these strains also exhibit some similarities in terpene profiles, but ultimately boast a unique composition that sets each one apart.\nClick to enlarge. (Elysse Feigenblatt/Leafly)\nWilly’s Wonder\n\n\nFind Willy’s Wonder Nearby\nWilly’s Wonder (or William’s Wonder) is an old Afghani cut that has seen more pipes than the Mario Bros. This old school beauty produces a sweet, tropical aroma thanks to notable quantities of myrcene, limonene, and linalool. These terpenes also contribute to Willy’s relaxing, yet happy physical buzz that gradually spreads over the consumer.\nCheese \n\n\n \nFind Cheese Nearby\nCheese is the inordinately pungent offspring of Skunk #1, another classic, foundational cannabis strain. Known for its sour and funky aroma, Cheese (also called UK Cheese and Exodus Cheese) made its mark on the palates of yesteryear. While its terpene plot looks somewhat similar to Willy’s Wonder, Cheese retains just enough sweet, floral funk to push the aroma from tropical to gnarly.\nWhite Widow\n\n \n\nFind White Widow Nearby\nWhite Widow firmly stands among the icons of cannabis. This hybrid cross of a Brazilian sativa landrace and a South Indian indica embodies the look and smell of what many consumers recognize as “classic” cannabis. Its semi-sedative effects and pungent earthy aroma lingers in the collective unconscious of lucky ducks who snagged a bag of this fine flower during its pre-legalization heyday.\nSour Diesel\n\n\nFind Sour Diesel Nearby\nWe’ve all encountered that signature acrid fuel aroma native to many cannabis varieties. The Sour Diesel genetic line has imparted its pungent, gassy fragrance to many strains over the years, and has essentially defined one of the many archetypal attributes of dank, potent cannabis.\nAK-47\n\n\n \nFind AK-47 Nearby\nAK-47 was created in the early 90s by blending a variety of landrace genetics together to create something outstanding. With a terpene profile rich in pinene and caryophyllene, AK-47 provides an alert mental state without uppity overstimulation.\nAmnesia Haze\n\n\n \nFind Amnesia Haze Nearby\nAmnesia Haze bridged the gap between the old and new worlds of cannabis. Bred from South Asian and Jamaican landrace genetics, this strain required a degree of globalization to even come into existence. The happy, heady buzz and peppery, tropical aroma of Haze genetics continue to inspire new strains and genetics.\nExplore More Classic Cannabis Strains\nStill jonesing for some timeless cannabis cuts?

After countless hours of organizing pertinent paperwork, filling out tedious forms, searching for a good accountant, and playing everyone’s much-loathed game, “Do I get a refund or do I need to shell out more of my earnings?”, let’s just say things can get a little stressful.\nFortunately, the Leafly team is here to offer your some good news. We’ve compiled a list of seven uber-relaxing strains to help you de-stress. As soon as you e-file, drop your tax paperwork off at the post office, or successfully file an extension so you can procrastinate for another six months, you might want to pick up a few from the list below.\n  1. Trainwreck\nThis strain was designed for those moments when you truly feel like an absolute Trainwreck. A potent sativa-dominant hybrid, this little lady is the perfect remedy for all of the headaches and anxiety that comes along with Tax Day.\n  2. Northern Lights\nOne of the most popular indicas, Northern Lights is a classic choice when you’re looking for a little rest and relaxation. Known best for its creative and uplifting effects, this is a great option for getting those artistic juices flowing after a long day of crunching numbers and staring at receipts.\n  3. Master Kush\nThere’s no better way to celebrate the end of a terrible day than with a 90s throwback. Master Kush is a plucky indica that won the High Times Cannabis Cup back in 1992 and again in 1993, making it a truly old school masterpiece.\n  4. GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\nThough the true stress-relieving qualities of this popular hybrid are only fully expressed when paired with frozen Thin Mints or Tagalongs, GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) is sure to take your mind off of the fact that your new job pushed you up a tax bracket this year. Congratulations! We bet no other promotion has felt quite so bittersweet.\n  5. Skunk #1\nAnother oldie but goodie, Skunk #1 first debuted in 1978 and is sure to take you back to a time when the world was a little simpler: no computer freezing right when you’re about to submit your forms, low risks of identity theft, and no hidden fees taken directly out of your refund by online tax help programs.\n  6. Willy’s Wonder\nIf any of you are like me, you’ve waited until the last possible minute to get your taxes sent in.
