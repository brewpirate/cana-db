This stuff smells great.\n\nAs for the taste, it is not overpowering, and pretty pleasant.  The smoke itself doesn\u0027t seem to expand too much, so feel free to take some fat bong rips.\n\nFor the high- I would say it is almost \"dreamy\".  I was typing on the keyboard while I was high on the woody, and it felt like my arms could just float off of their sockets.\n\nI would recommend this strain for pain, insomnia, and watching cartoons.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1615785,"username":"esewaffles","text":"super relaxing! love this strain. its a good night time bud.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":61,"flavors":[{"name":"Woody","score":29.878048780487806},{"name":"Pine","score":28.658536585365852},{"name":"Nutty","score":25.914634146341463},{"name":"Earthy","score":4.5731707317073171},{"name":"Sweet","score":2.1341463414634148}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":60.670731707317074},{"name":"Sleepy","score":57.6219512195122},{"name":"Happy","score":32.926829268292686},{"name":"Euphoric","score":30.487804878048781},{"name":"Hungry","score":28.658536585365852}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":26.829268292682926},{"name":"Insomnia","score":8.536585365853659},{"name":"Stress","score":7.6219512195121952},{"name":"Pain","score":6.7073170731707323},{"name":"Depression","score":4.2682926829268295}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":6.0975609756097562},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.8292682926829267},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.524390243902439},{"name":"Migraines","score":1.524390243902439},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":1.2195121951219512}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":30.182926829268293},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":2.4390243902439024},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.8292682926829267},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.8292682926829267},{"name":"Headache","score":0.91463414634146334}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/woody-kush_100x100_fde5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/587531/b/woody-kush__primary_3472.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/woody-kush_100x100_d412.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/587530/b/woody-kush__primary_5e72.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/woody-kush_100x100_8f00.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/500939/b/woody-kush__primary_4c05.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/woody-kush_100x100_4eb6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/454956/b/woody-kush__primary_8d10.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/woody-kush_100x100_1edd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/437683/b/woody-kush__primary_826b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/woody-kush_100x100_6761.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/437398/b/woody-kush__primary_77bf.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":19,"popularCities":["Aptos, CA","Los Angeles, CA","Milwaukie, OR","Ritzville, WA","Santa Ana, CA","Spokane Valley, WA","Spokane, WA","West Hollywood, CA","Yakima, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/woody-kush","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.31147540983607/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
