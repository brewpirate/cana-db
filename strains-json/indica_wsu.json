Named in homage to Washington State University, don\u2019t confuse this strain with the UW indica, whose name is derived from the rivaling University of Washington.

Training Day\n\nBred by DNA Genetics, Training Day is a 70% indica that combines parent strains Trainwreck and LA Confidential. This California native takes after its LA Confidential parent in aroma and delivers a pungent earthy and pine flavor. As demonstrated by its thick blanket of crystal resin, Training Day will put your THC tolerance to the test so novices should approach this strain with caution.\n\nFind out which locations are currently carrying Training Day\n\u00a0\n 7. OG Chem\n\nOG Chem, also called Chem OG, is a sativa-dominant cross between two legendary strains, Chemdawg and OG Kush.
