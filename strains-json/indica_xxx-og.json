This is my first time smoking this particular strain.  It is a beautiful flower that I donated for at ODC (One Drop Collective,) in Bakersfield, CA.  I loved the pungent OG smell with very slight skunkiness.  After the first hit I wondered, hmm, then, WHAM!  So for me, a definite one-hit-and-quit strain.  XXX OG allowed symptoms of carpal tunnel, muscle spasticity, and insomnia to melt away and I slept like a baby.  I wouldn\u0027t recommend to a novice, because I am a seasoned smoker and half a hit would have been just right.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"},{"id":1616423,"username":"Daymoan","text":"I was very skeptical on how this strand would make me feel while battling depression.

We’ve come a long way since the dawn of stoner stigmas, and Leafly’s primary goal is to promote worldwide acceptance of marijuana consumption beyond the usual stereotypes. But the market hasn’t always been as polished and PC as it is today, and we still have a lot of work to do.\nBrowse our database of strains and you’ll notice a few that stick out like sore thumbs amidst marketable monikers like Blue Dream, White Lotus, and Strawberry Kush. Some cannabis breeders are much less serious when it comes time to name their new genetic creation, and this list showcases the best of the worst – the dirtiest, the weirdest, the most NSFW strains in the history of cannabis.\n \n1. Wet Dream\n\nThere are a ton of strains out there that induce severe horniness in some individuals (trust us, we read enough detailed and personal strain reviews to know). But, as far as we know, this sativa strain didn’t get its name from a night of magical, sexy, THC-fueled dreams. Wet Dream is just a cleverly named genetic cross between parent strains Blue Dream and Ocean Beach Haze.\n \n2. MILF\n\nThe MILF strain was popularized by the Showtime series “Weeds” as the main character’s signature product, but it’s also a strain that exists in the real world. After hearing the way some growers talk about their “sexy ladies” in the garden, you might suspect that MILF was created by some dendrophiliac who gets off to marijuana plants nearing the end of their maturation cycle. Nope. It’s just a cheeky acronym for “Marijuana I’d Like to Flower.”\n \n3. Purple Monkey Balls\n\nThe history of Purple Monkey Balls is, for the most part, shrouded in mystery. But if we were to guess how its birth story went, it probably went something like:\n\"Once upon a time, there lived a dude that thought poop jokes and penis cartoons were the best thing ever. One day while tending his pot garden, the dude noticed his plants blooming with large, round, purple buds covered in wiry orange pistil hairs. ‘How testicular and primate-like these are,’ he noted with impeccable perception. ‘…Purple Monkey Balls. Yes. Who wouldn\u0027t smoke that?\u0027 And it was so.\"\n \n4. XXX OG\n\nWARNING: this strain contains somewhat hardcore levels of THC. Consumer discretion is advised. So yeah, this is a super potent indica strain that\u0027s said to have aphrodisiac qualities, but take in too much XXX OG and you’re more likely to find yourself uselessly slumped on the couch than in the bedroom making sexy times.\n \n5. Dirty Girl\n\nNot sure if people just expect arousal with a name like Dirty Girl, but there are enough horndog Leafly reviews to question the power of placebo. It’s easy to see Dirty Girl having a positive influence on the libido, though: the effects are energizing, functional, and just euphoric enough to turn a good night into a really, really, really ridiculously good night.\n \n6. Alaskan Thunder Fuck\n\nDespite having a name that would offend all those who keep a swear jar in their home, Alaskan Thunder Fuck remains a timeless classic that won’t be leaving the market any time soon. Some medical marijuana dispensaries abbreviate it to “ATF” on their menus to keep up appearances, but one might argue that this doesn’t provide fair warning of the thundering cerebral mindf*ck to come.\n \n7. Asian Fantasy\n\nYeah, there’s no exciting back story to Asian Fantasy. Her name\u0027s the only reason she\u0027s on this list.\n \nHave you come across any other cringe-tastic, dirty, or downright NSFW strains?
