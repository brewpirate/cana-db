These fuzzy little nugs are just what you need the next time you throw on Return of the Jedi to revisit the furry bears of the Forest Moon.\n \n \nDun, dun, dun, dun, dun-dun, dun, dun-dun! Darth Vader may be missing from The Force Awakens, but you can still honor his memory by indulging in the heavy-handed Darth Vader OG. As if commanded by the Sith Lord himself, this indica will leave you unable to resist sinking deeply into the couch while relaxing bliss invades the mind.\n \n \nLike the Rebel Alliance pilot himself, Skywalker OG will fly you across the galaxies with soaring euphoria. Perhaps the relaxing effects of this hybrid will provide you with all the patience you need to become a Jedi master, but don\u0027t underestimate its power — overdo this one and you\u0027ll find yourself too comfy to save the world from intergalactic tyranny.\n \n \nThe green, fuzzy buds of Yoda OG may not impart quite as much wisdom as its Jedi namesake, but it just might make you hungry enough to steal Luke Skywalker\u0027s dinner. This long-lasting indica is a perfect companion for a night of Star Wars marathons, but be careful with the force of this indica: too much and you\u0027ll be snoring before the opening lore finishes scrolling up your screen.\n \n \nThe Jedi Kush indica is meant to encourage the principles of Jedi Code through a peaceful and harmonious mindset. Harness the pacifying effects this indica has to offer and let it help you achieve a higher understanding and sympathy towards life of all forms.\nHungry for more Star Wars strains? Get a head start on 2016\u0027s May the Fourth holiday with these celebratory options!\n\nImage Source: JD Hancock via Flickr Creative Commons","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12001333/7-star-wars-strains-to-prepare-you-for-the-force-awakens.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/7-star-wars-strains-to-prepare-you-for-the-force-awakens"}],"reviewCount":278,"flavors":[{"name":"Pine","score":31.624579124579121},{"name":"Earthy","score":22.316217732884404},{"name":"Woody","score":22.1324354657688},{"name":"Sweet","score":21.993546576879911},{"name":"Flowery","score":12.439674523007858}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":100.05611672278337},{"name":"Euphoric","score":76.026936026936013},{"name":"Sleepy","score":65.97923681257015},{"name":"Happy","score":42.180134680134671},{"name":"Uplifted","score":41.362233445566773}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":91.4618406285073},{"name":"Pain","score":90.072951739618418},{"name":"Insomnia","score":75.349326599326588},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":44.2185746352413},{"name":"Depression","score":38.538159371492696}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":30.527497194163864},{"name":"PTSD","score":14.847081930415264},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":12.115600448933783},{"name":"Migraines","score":5.833333333333333},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.9074074074074074}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":28.737373737373737},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":22.055274971941639},{"name":"Dizzy","score":11.498316498316498},{"name":"Paranoid","score":11.112514029180696},{"name":"Headache","score":9.8625140291806961}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/yoda-og_100x100_d31a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/653176/b/yoda-og__primary_fc3f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/yoda-og_100x100_aab2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/646446/b/yoda-og__primary_876a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/yoda-og_100x100_a9a0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/634378/b/yoda-og__primary_d530.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/yoda-og_100x100_3840.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/631818/b/yoda-og__primary_a143.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/yoda-og_100x100_69a6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/590542/b/yoda-og__primary_0a0f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/yoda-og_100x100_8e93.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/554031/b/yoda-og__primary_0c5c.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":47,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Los Angeles, CA","Vancouver, BC","Everett, WA","Montréal, QC","Phoenix, AZ","Santa Ana, CA","Spokane, WA","Toronto, ON","Airway Heights, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/yoda-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.47841726618705/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"OG Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"og-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush","symbol":"Ogk","applink":"leafly://strain/og-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
