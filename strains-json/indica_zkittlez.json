            "text": "Leafly\u2019s Faves is a series providing a glimpse into the strains, products, and brands that our team of cannabis aficionados is buying, consuming, and enjoying the most every year. Some are entirely new to the market, while others are simply perennial favorites that we can\u2019t recommend enough. Below, find our crew\u2019s favorite cannabis flower products of 2017. How many have you tried? What was\u00a0your\u00a0favorite flower of 2017? Share with us in the comments below!\n\nChocolope by Gabriel\nAvailable in: Washington\nChocolope\u2019s bright and dreamy sativa effects are magnified by the exceptional grow practices laid out in Gabriel\u2019s airtight facilities. Their cultivation rooms are sealed from the outside, offering perfect environmental control that is carefully manipulated to stimulate the growth of the best quality flower.\nAlso featured in:\n\nWhat Are You Smoking? Episode 15\nWashington\u2019s Best Tasting Strains From Fall 2017\n\nKosher Kush by Santa Cruz Veteran\u2019s Alliance\nAvailable in: California\nThe high-THC indica Kosher Kush is the perfect strain to crush symptoms of PTSD, and the Santa Cruz Veteran\u2019s Alliance\u2014owned and operated by military veterans\u2014produces this pain-relieving strain for those suffering. We love that members are offered free cannabis grown by fellow veterans in rooms meant to exude peace as the cannabis flower blooms.\nAlso featured in: The VA Can\u2019t Provide Cannabis to Veterans With PTSD, so This Group Gives It Out for Free\nDutchberry by Artizen\nAvailable in: Washington\nWith around 27% THC to 8% CBD, the cheerful hybrid Dutchberry boasts one of the highest cannabinoid contents of all time. To house such a powerhouse strain, Artizen moves in tandem with their flower from growth to packaging\u2014and delivers some excellent buds. We love that they slow down and take a little time with their cannabis crops from start to finish.\n\nPineapple by Fire Bros.\nAvailable in: Washington\nA Seattle favorite, Fire Bros. works with their own phenotypes to produce the most effective cannabis flower for consumers. For an uplifting hybrid strain such as Pineapple, stress-relieving characteristics are an important facet enhanced by Fire Bros.\u2019 hand-selection process.\nHybrid Blend by Lowell Farms\nAvailable in: California\nLowell Farms, which works exclusively with flower, offers seasonal blends of their best strains, and we can\u2019t get enough of their hybrid pre-rolls. We appreciate that they\u2019re thinking outside the box in focusing on balanced flower mixes rather than strain-specific products. Grown in organic fertilizer free of pesticides, Lowell takes pride in their dedication to all-natural cannabis as well as in providing good wages for their workers.\nAlso featured in: What Are You Smoking? Episode 3\nZkittlez by Royal Choice Farms\nAvailable in: Arizona\nArizona does not require pesticide testing for cannabis, so it\u2019s all the more important to find a grower you can trust. Royal Choice Farms chose to be an all-organic operation built on a whole lot of love and no pesticides. By instating natural grow methods, Royal Choice keeps our minds at ease when we\u2019re lighting up their sweet indica Zkittles.\n\nCBD Blue Shark by Marley Natural Red\nAvailable in: California, Oregon, Washington*\nWith a full cannabis operation dedicated to Jamaica\u2019s rich culture, Marley Natural hits it out of the park with their hand-selected flower line\u2014notably, the anti-inflammatory and CBD-rich hybrid CBD Blue Shark. Cultivated by independent growers, we love Marley Natural\u2019s dedication to craft cannabis, their commitment to sustainable growing practices, and their RISE UP social justice program.\nBlack Cherry Soda by Royal Tree Gardens\nAvailable in: Washington\nHaving built a facility from the ground up, Washington\u2019s Royal Tree Gardens is a company steeped in perseverance. Licensed since 2014, Royal Tree Farms has been producing fantastic cannabis ever since, and their sativa-dominant Black Cherry Soda is no exception. We\u2019ve been packing our bowls with this strain for its potent relief, particularly for the medical patients among us.\nDo-Si-Dos by Matrix NV\nAvailable in: Nevada\nOne of the best in medical-grade cannabis production, Nevada\u2019s Matrix NV keeps their focus on the people who will consume their products, and that\u2019s why we love them. Their flower, including the deliciously heavy indica Do-Si-Dos, is cared for by a team of passionate people who use purified and organic products to cultivate their hand-trimmed flower collection.\nAlso featured in: Leafly TV\u2019s Growers: Episode 101\n\nOrange Blossom by Falcanna\nAvailable in: Washington\nA small medical operation turned Tier III licensed producer, Falcanna has seen it all when comes to cannabis\u2014from the garden to the shop. Their dedication to the herb started as a dream between founders Bethany and Justin Rondeau and turned into a full grow facility delivering exceptional cannabis across Washington State. Their bright, floral hybrid Orange Blossom is as tasty as it is elevating and provides a perfect example of their dedication to quality flower.\nWhite Tahoe Cookies by Archive Portland\nAvailable in: Oregon\nWith multiple awards under their belt, Archive Portland boasts a team of growers with over 35 years of collective cannabis growing experience. That dedication to quality trickles down to the buds, where the exceptional indica White Tahoe Cookies takes on a smooth sedative high that keeps us coming back for more.\nLemonder by Seattle\u2019s Private Reserve\nAvailable in: Washington\nWe save Seattle\u2019s Private Reserve flower for special occasions; grown in a facility that is tightly sealed and meticulously controlled, the euphoric hybrid Lemonder has found its way into our stash boxes and smoke circles throughout 2017. SPR\u2019s rigorous testing of all their cannabis products lets us consume with full peace of mind.\nLead image by\u00a0Nastasic/iStock\n*Editor\u2019s note: Leafly and Marley Natural are owned by the same parent company. Also, Marley Natural Red is available in California, Oregon, and Washington but may be a different high-CBD strain in each market.",

            "text": "Thank you for the investment of your time. I will try not to waste it.\nVisual Inspections:\nVarious shades of green, with slight purple, but most striking is the OFF THE CHARTS thick coat of white crystalline structures throughout the buds, all the way down the stalks. The bud structure is more like a sativa or a hybrid, with the largest cola approximately 6\"x2\", in the ounce, but most buds 2\" to 3\" size.\n\nThe Nose:\nThe odor of these flowers is truly unique for an Indica. They smell very similar to some Sativa varieties I've experienced, like Jack Herrer or some other flowery/fruity scented buds. Most of the Indica strains I've been lucky enough to smoke, have a hasty/earthy flavor, if derived from the kush from Afghanistan, or maybe a grapes/plum flavor, if a fine purple Indica is within your grasp; or even a,\"Blackwater's ,beautiful berry/tobacco/woodsy scent, is totally different than that of Zkiddlez. After grinding up a bud, a fruity, citrus odor stands out. A truly unique scent; a wonderful odor. Closest smell that comes to mind is a fine crop of Jack Herrer, on the Sativa end, and maybe a fresh bud of Northern Lights, on the Indica side.\n\nFlavor:\nI hand-rolled a nice joint, and brother, was it a delightful, delicious, first hit. Tastes very sweet and smooth...right now, it's the sweetest little doobie this old toker has ever enjoyed! I can taste a little citrus flavor from the grapefruit, and a lot of sweet berries and grapes. \n\nEffects:\nI smoked 1/2 the joint, as is my practice when giving reviews, and I'm perplexed by some of the other ratings that give Zkiddlez low marks for strength, or as I like to term it, \"Stopping Power\", a phrase used to describe a weapons ability to take down your target with one shot.  Zkiddlez is plenty strong for,this old hombre, as I am pleasantly sedated in my body, yet mentally stimulated; enough so, that here I am, giving you this \"heads up\".\n\nConclusion:\nZkiddlez is a unique, delicious, and a very smooth smoke. I feel privileged to have the opportunity to experience its flavor and positive effects, and to be able to communicate these observations to you.\n5 Stars for Zkiddlez!\n",
