            "text": "Cannabis has an odd kind of reverence about it. It inters people of fame, infamy, and import by immortalizing their names through the creation of unique genetic crossbreeds. Few other industries pay homage to a canon of sharks, musicians, activists, and pure nonsense like cannabis does, and this week's New Strains Alert is no different. You will find a guitar god, an escaped criminal, a fork, a bottle of blended Canadian whisky, a doctor/gorilla hybrid, a pie that goes zoom, and Frida, \"the heroin of pain,\" all in one place, living in harmony.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Robert Plant\n\nRobert Plant is the heady, stimulating virtuoso brought to life by crossing\u00a0Blue Dream\u00a0and\u00a0Rebel God Smoke. This creative and drastically energetic strain combines Blue Dream\u2019s hazy, uplifted mental energy and Rebel God Smoke\u2019s full-throttle stimulation to bring about motivation and creativity. Respect the potency of this strain, as even pro-level consumers can experience a racing heart. This strain wad crafted by\u00a0Colorado Seed Inc.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Zoom Pie\n\nZoom Pie (also known as Zombie Pie) is a heavy indica-dominant strain that blends the potency of\u00a0Blue Zombie\u00a0with the Cookie Fam legend,\u00a0Cherry Pie. This combination yields blue and purple foliage that reeks of tart cherries and pungent skunky fuel. It is known to stimulate appetite while imbuing the consumer with a heady euphoria (presumably from the recessive African landrace,\u00a0Durban Poison, nestled in Cherry Pie). Enjoy this strain as a means to crush stress, physical discomfort, and depression. But be aware, this strain will apply sedative effects to the body when dosed heavily.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Frida\n\nWith the dense, full flavor of her indica parentage and over 12% CBD from an\u00a0ACDC\u00a0mother, Frida is a complex and enchanting strain that provides relief for mind and body while fueling inspiration, sensuality, appetite, and meditation. Named in celebration of \u201cThe Heroine of Pain,\u201d Frida by Raven Grass reminds the consumer to reach further, encouraging physical wellness without encumbering you with sedation. Enjoy Frida\u2019s therapeutic effects as a panacea for hangovers, chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. This high-CBD indica-dominant hybrid is a beautiful stone-alone strain, but is also an excellent addition to cannabis blends. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Fork\n\nColorado Seed Inc.\u2019s \u201cThe Fork\u201d is dubbed as such because the original breeders utilized a fork, a knife, and a spoon in lieu of tagging their three mysterious Hawaiian strains with specific names. Those marked with a knife and spoon turned out to be less than satisfactory, but \u201cThe Fork\u201d expressed brilliant sativa-dominant qualities that could not be ignored. With effects similar to those of Durban Poison, The Fork dishes up exhilarating physical and mental energy that encourages activity.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0El Chapo OG\n\nEl Chapo OG is a potent indica strain out of California that smells of rich earth and pine. With dense jade popcorn buds that exhibit a shimmering coat of trichomes, this strain is visually striking and worth keeping on display. Its effects are initially stunning and settle on the body as carefree relaxation. El Chapo OG is preferred near the end of the day as its effects can become rather sedating with continued use. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Crown Royale\n\nCrown Royale is a sweet indica-dominant hybrid that blends the best of parent strains\u00a0Blueberry\u00a0and\u00a0Purple Kush\u00a0together. This flower is a feast for the eyes with bright purple hues and deep green foliage. Just as delightful on the palate, Crown Royale exhibits notes of the forest floor with piney aromas and a telltale berry tartness. These scents show up in the flavor as a sweeter, fruiter pine. Enjoy this strain for pervasive physical effects that dull pain, nausea, and stress. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Guptilla\n\nGuptilla is a potent indica-dominant cross bred by\u00a0Colorado Seed Inc.\u00a0With the glittering trichome laden foliage of\u00a0GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4)\u00a0intermixed with the \u201cDr. of Dankness\u201d\u00a0Gupta Kush, this strain raises kushy, full-bodied indica effects to a level that few have the privilege of enjoying. Anticipate pungent floral and earthy overtones with pronounced cerebral headiness that is anchored to the earth by the physical weight this strain places on the limbs. Enjoy this strain at the end of the day, as its effects are very sedating. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other\u00a0new strains\u00a0that were recently added to the\u00a0Leafly Explorer, or check out\u00a0last week's newest additions!",
