            "text": "I lived in Indonesia for about 9 years and smoked a ton of this weed. It's one of my top 5 favorites. Maybe top 3. It was reliably a relaxing, feel good sativa with next to no paranoiability. Mellow but energetic. Dark chocolaty earthy, citrus, spiced smelling buds with a stringy consistency. It actually looks like it's going to be terrible. Not so however. I've not smoked anything quite like it. \n\n*Sometimes the buds are soaked in liquid methamphetamine that's also produced in the region and sold as 'Special weed' or 'Tripping weed' but it's ice, plain and simple. I learned that one the hard way a few times.. So any legend of super charged sativa from Sumatra may have to do with the ice factor.",
