It\u0027s one of my top 5 favorites. Maybe top 3. It was reliably a relaxing, feel good sativa with next to no paranoiability. Mellow but energetic. Dark chocolaty earthy, citrus, spiced smelling buds with a stringy consistency. It actually looks like it\u0027s going to be terrible. Not so however. I\u0027ve not smoked anything quite like it. \n\n*Sometimes the buds are soaked in liquid methamphetamine that\u0027s also produced in the region and sold as \u0027Special weed\u0027 or \u0027Tripping weed\u0027 but it\u0027s ice, plain and simple. I learned that one the hard way a few times..
