            "text": "\"African\" is being used here as a blanket term for \"all African landrace strains.\"  That includes Durban Poison, Malawi Gold, Swazi Gold, Congolese, Kilimanjaro (Kenya landrace), Mozambika, Swazi Redbeard, Ethiopian, Kwazulu (SA), Zamal, Angola Gold, and countless others.  Unless you yourself have smoked any of these strains and they were grown and cured properly, you probably don't know what the African continent has to offer the cannabis world.  These are some of the most uplifting, energetic, clear-headed and actually *medicinal* strains in the world, and many of them are still in their pure un-hybridized form (it's very hard to find pure unadulterated landraces anymore).  African landrace strains are said to contain the highest THCV-a content of any other place in the world - this cannabinoid contributes to a more energetic buzz and is an appetite *suppressant*, not an appetite stimulant like THC.  It is being researched as a treatment for Parkinsons and other diseases.  It is one of the promising cannabinoids like CBD which could have many uses in the medical community.  And it is found most commonly in African landrace strains.  \n\nSo, to get a bit of the African experience, first go try some real Durban (half the \"Durban Poison\" I find in dispensaries is some complete different strain) - it should smell like mint spices and jasmine (some people say licorice) the smell is what gives away real Durban; if it smells kind of Skunky, it's from one of the many seedbanks who cross their Durban with Skunk #1 to shorten flowering time, and is NOT pure Durban.  Then get your hands on some Malawi, and maybe some Congolese or Swazi Gold, because in the USA that's about all that circulates for the public, and even that is not easy to find. Or track down these seed lines and grow them yourself - there are a couple seed companies that still have these strains although they can be hard to obtain.",
