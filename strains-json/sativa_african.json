Unless you yourself have smoked any of these strains and they were grown and cured properly, you probably don\u0027t know what the African continent has to offer the cannabis world.  These are some of the most uplifting, energetic, clear-headed and actually *medicinal* strains in the world, and many of them are still in their pure un-hybridized form (it\u0027s very hard to find pure unadulterated landraces anymore).  African landrace strains are said to contain the highest THCV-a content of any other place in the world - this cannabinoid contributes to a more energetic buzz and is an appetite *suppressant*, not an appetite stimulant like THC.  It is being researched as a treatment for Parkinsons and other diseases.  It is one of the promising cannabinoids like CBD which could have many uses in the medical community.
