            "text": "JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 The police chief recently named to the board that regulates Alaska\u2019s legal marijuana industry said the fight that has long been waged against pot in this country has been a \u201cwaste of time\u201d and a waste of law enforcement resources.\nJeff Ankerfelt, who is police chief in the southeast Alaska city of Sitka, told The Associated Press on Friday that he wants to contribute to the successful implementation of well thought-out industry regulations. During his career in law enforcement, he came to the conclusion that \u201cour war on marijuana was really a waste of time and counterproductive, particularly as there was increasing evidence that there was some medical benefits to the use of marijuana.\u201d\n\nAnkerfelt said he is interested in investigating the medical benefits.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the marijuana plant has chemicals that may help symptoms for some health problems. But the agency says there\u2019s insufficient research on whether the plant works to treat or cure those conditions.\nAnkerfelt was appointed by Gov. Bill Walker to the Marijuana Control Board\u2019s public safety seat, replacing Travis Welch, who only served for about two months.\nPrior to Welch, Soldotna Police Chief Pete Mlynarik held the seat. He resigned in January after the U.S. Department of Justice shifted from a more lenient stance on marijuana enforcement.\n\nMlynarik said the department\u2019s decision removed the underpinning on which Alaska\u2019s industry is based and did away with the federal government \u201clooking the other way\u201d in states that have legalized marijuana.\nAlaska Gov. Bill Walker has said he\u2019s committed to upholding the will of Alaskans, who voted in 2014 to legalize adult use of marijuana.\nCary Carrigan, executive director of the Alaska Marijuana Industry Association, said he\u2019s interested in learning more about Ankerfelt and encouraged by what he\u2019s heard so far.\n\u201cI think Mlynarik saw it as, he was still in the drug war, Mlynarik was,\u201d Carrigan said.",

            "text": "This article is sponsored by NYVapeShop.com, a top online retailer for vaporizers, domeless nails and other cool accessories. With years of manufacturing experience, the owners of NYVapeShop.com use their know-how to produce high-quality products at very affordable prices. They offer a ton of options including over 500 color combos and FREE shipping on all orders.\n\nThe United States contains an incredible range of awe-inspiring locations, landmarks and scenery, and there are countless among them that strike us as worthy of a vape session. Whether you\u2019re looking out over a natural wonder, chowing down on exceptional grub, relishing a performance at a music venue, or simply executing everyday activities, a compact, unobtrusive vape is capable of elevating the experience.\nSo with the help of NYVapeShop.com co-founders Joe and Greg, we picked out just seven great vape-worthy times and places, based on the natural beauty of the location or the circumstances that surround it. Trust us, narrowing them down wasn\u2019t easy. Do you agree with our choices? Which ones would you add to the list?\nGrabbing a slice\u00a0in NYC\n\nThough Joe is unaffiliated with Joe\u2019s Pizza, he\u2019d put their pies up against any others in the city, at least in terms of the \u2018regular slice\u2019 \u2013 and since he and NYVapeShop.com co-founder Greg are both from New York, they\u2019ve tried their fair share of local pizza. \u201cI believe [Joe\u2019s] only makes regular and maybe pepperoni pies and slices,\u201d says Joe. \u201cIt's a small place, very fast-paced, and they can be rude but they get away with it\u2026Everyone loves pizza, and they have the best.\u201d\u00a0\nLooking out over the Grand Canyon in Arizona\n\nThe Grand Canyon is among the most visit-worthy and photo-worthy places in the nation, and there\u2019s no question that it makes the list of most vape-worthy places, too. It\u2019s especially beautiful at sunset, with golden rays bouncing off an already staggering range of canyon colors. Tote a vape pen along to heighten the experience (as if it needed heightening).\nOutside the Buckhorn Exchange in Denver\n\nSays Joe of Denver\u2019s oldest restaurant, whose walls have been gathering hunting trophies since 1893, \u201cI'm an animal lover, but they have the heads of every animal you can think of, some killed over 80 years ago, and some even by Teddy Roosevelt. Check this place out \u2013 amazing food, and very nice people run it.\u201d\nWatching a home game in Seattle\n\nWhether you're watching the home team at their open-air stadium or catching aerial coverage from the comfort of your own couch, seeing Seattle sports games play out in the Emerald City\u00a0is a memorable experience. For the sake of team\u00a0spirit, make your vape pen blue or green.\nOn a glacier day cruise in Alaska\n\nAlaska\u2019s brand of untouched natural beauty is peerless nationwide, and few activities make that more apparent than glacier-centric sightseeing cruises. Prince William Sound, a short drive south of Anchorage, is a great place to go \u2013 hop on one of many boats offering this sort of day trip with a vape pen in your coat pocket (in a subtle Snow Camo color scheme, perhaps?) and settle in for a day of wildlife sightings and incomparable scenery.\nRelishing the music at South by Southwest in Austin\n\nFew places offer more good music than Austin, Tex. \u2013 especially during its legendary annual festival, South by Southwest. We\u2019re of the mind that standing in the crowd waiting for any of the festival headliners to come onstage would be a good time for a vape sesh. Amidst throngs of colorful people, a colorful vape pen promises to fit in perfectly.\nHailing a cab in New York\n\nBringing it back to NYVapeShop.com\u2019s hometown, from where Joe and Greg send vape pens to all fifty states and beyond via free shipping, Joe says that hailing a cab in New York is typically the point when you\u2019re transitioning from one activity or bar to another, so it\u2019s a perfect time to get a vape session in. \u201cThe process can be frustrating at times so a vape can help with the situation,\u201d explains Joe, \u201cplus after the session you won't smell getting into the cab and heading to your next destination.\u201d\nFind the perfect vaporizer for any location at NYVapeShop.com.\n\nImage Sources: William Bigelis (cropped) and Anthony Quintano (curves, cropped)\u00a0via Flickr Creative Commons",
