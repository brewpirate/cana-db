Very little anxiety and it gave me the giggles with a grin that just wouldn't go away. In higher doses it rushes behind your eyes and gives a feeling of bliss and euphoria with an almost numbing body high but still very functional. Also it seemed very good for social events. It cleared my mind, like the flood gates for deep conversations. highly recommended! ",
