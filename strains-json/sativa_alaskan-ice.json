Our new indica strain from the southern Chinese province of Yunnan is a go-to medicine for aches, pains, and bad moods. Dream Berry, another elite strain from Apothecary Genetics, puts an indica spin on fan-favorite Blue Dream by adding Blueberry to the mix. Last but not least, we added two high-CBD strains, Harle-Tsu and Zen, which have worked wonders for patients treating pain, inflammation, and digestive issues.\nAre these strains old news to you?
