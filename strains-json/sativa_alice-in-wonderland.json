In lieu of extensive preparation, the best punches are simply made by layering complementary flavors, and terpene-laden cannabis adds one more element of both flavor and effect, augmenting the overall experience of classic fall punch drinks.\nThe following autumnal drink recipes are adapted to accommodate the addition of cannabis tinctures. While any infused tincture you have on hand will do, we’ve recommended a few specific strains whose terpenes amplify each elixir. If you don’t have any tinctures handy, you can make your own, or check the menus of your favorite local dispensaries to find a place where you can pick one up.\n\nMix up a batch of one of the following, pop the pitcher in your fridge, and enjoy an extra-chill punch at your leisure. Cheers to fall!\nSparkling Sativa-Pear Punch\n\nThis pretty pink punch is ideal for the last few semi-sunny fall afternoons on the patio or porch. Whether you’re expecting company or cozied up on your own, keep plenty on hand so you’re ready whenever autumn calls for something to sip.\n\n2 parts pear nectar or pear juice\n2 parts Prosecco (make this a non-alcoholic punch with sparkling cider or lemon-lime soda)\n1 part cranberry juice\n10 mg-worth of cannabis tincture (suggested strains: sweet Candy Jack, tart Vortex, or floral Alice in Wonderland)\nGarnish: pear slice and/or freshly grated nutmeg\n\nAdapted from Sparking Pear-Prosecco Punch by Delish.\nCanna-Pome-Grapefruit Punch\n\nThis fruity pomegranate-grapefruit concoction marries your cannabis tincture with bright citrus notes and deep dark pomegranate colors and characteristics.
