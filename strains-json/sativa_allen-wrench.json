            "text": "Cannabis and THC affect people differently. For many first-time users, cannabis can feel very sedative and \u201cstoney,\u201d leading many to believe these relaxing attributes are native to all cannabis. However, more seasoned cannabis consumers may employ many different strains for different situations, using cannabis like an herb or spice to add dimension to whatever activity they\u2019re engaged in and help boost their productivity.\nAs a budtender, I overcome lethargy, insomnia, social anxiety, and writer\u2019s block by pairing specific strains with particular activities so I can feel more productive. In my opinion, productivity is the surplus energy that emerges as the result of taking care of yourself (and your body). Cannabis can be a motivating force that rewards the user as they overcome their own productivity obstacles.\nHere are six strains that may help boost your productivity, giving you the lift you need to exercise, tick off your to-do list, or get through a busy day.\nChemdawg\n\u00a0\nChemdawg is one of my favorite strains to smoke before going for a run.\nVery calming. Felt productive and active for a bit, then relaxed, not sleepy. \u2013PurmaBurn\nAllen Wrench\n \nAllen Wrench brings clarity to the mind and even more energy to the body. As a budtender, I recommended this as a replacement for a cup of coffee.\nDoes exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do. I was getting a bit stressed and needed something to calm me down while [cheering] me up and this was exactly what I need. Everything was great during my high and I was also still productive! Allen Wrench is now my favorite strain. \u2013Graynug\nJack Herer\n \nThe legendary Jack Herer is similar to Allen Wrench in terms of the mental clarity it offers.\nGood sativa for productivity. Not spacey or dreamy. Sitting makes me bored with this strain. I only vaporize a very small amount in a classic log vape roughly every 1.5 hours while staying busy. Great strain for the odd job around the house you\u2019ve been putting off! (I\u2019ve done a few today and a couple more on tap for a productive Sunday). Pain? What pain? Bummed? Who me? No! \u2013PieceFrog\nCinex\n \nCinex is another clarity-enhancing strain that delivers a sustained burst of energy.\nOne of my favorite strains. Musty earthy aroma with a hint of citrus. Hits hard but quickly subsides to a manageable and productive high. Great strain to open up all the windows, blast music, and get some spring cleaning done! \u2013DJkwonderbread\nDurban Poison\n\u00a0\nDurban Poison is an African landrace with so much energy, even daily smokers use this sativa with care. If you want that \u201cspeedy\u201d feeling, this is your pick.\nI love this strain it uplifts my spirits and allows me to stay productive throughout the day. If you want to get things done, smoke some Durban. \u2013HaysonA\nDutch Treat\n\u00a0\nDutch Treat is a mid-level hybrid that ultimately transforms into a relaxing euphoria.\nVery pleasant, very earthy flavor. Smoked a joint and had a wonderfully productive morning, but now people have arrived at the office and I\u2019m extra talkative / easily distracted. \u2026. Now after 3 joints my eyes are dry, my mouth is dry and\u2026 uhhh.. \u2013Millenion\nLooking for more productive strains? Check out our list and choose one that sounds like it could provide the effects you want.",

You'll appreciate the bag of High Times centerfold buds -- compact, rippled with red hairs and powdered with a dusting of white crystals; this is some of da kind that demands your attention. Don't just snap off a bud and cram it in your pipe, you fucking Philistine! No, stop and admire. Breathe in the chemically scent. Give it the ol' pinch-test for density. THEN cram it in your pipe and smoke it! 15 minutes later when you're laughing your ass off at \"Action Bronson Watches Ancient Aliens\", try to give a fuck about something. Protip: you won't be able to! That's because Allen Wrench absorbs 10,000 times its own weight in fucks! Dinner's three hours late? Don't give a fuck. Car's being re-possessed? Don't give a fuck. Cat's speaking Swahili and your third eye is now projecting Dan Deacon videos? I told you to lay off those bathsalts, motherfucker! Who needs that shit when you've got a miracle like Allen Wrench smouldering in your pipe? Hit that shit quick before it all goes up in smoke! \"Waste not the Allen,\" sayth the dude sitting to your right who has been waiting for you to pass that pipe since you started reading this shit.
