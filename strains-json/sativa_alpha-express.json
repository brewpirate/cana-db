These seven strains are among our newest additions, but be sure to check out the many other strains recently added to the Explorer and leave reviews for all the ones you\u0027ve tried.\n \n 1. Michael Phelps OG\n\nWhen word got out that the Olympic gold medalist enjoyed cannabis, it was only a matter of time before a strain would be named in his honor. Michael Phelps OG is a hybrid strain that no doubt carries OG Kush genetics, but other ancestry remains uncertain. You can smell the OG in this one as earthy, sweet notes of pine and lemon explode on the exhale. Small doses of Michael Phelps OG leave your mind and body agile, but overdo it and you’re more likely to find the effects ironically lazy and inactive.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Michael Phelps OG\n \n 2. Purple Champagne\n\nPurple Champagne is a sativa-dominant cannabis strain bred by Grand Daddy Purp, who crossed a rare sativa phenotype of his famous Granddaddy Purple with Pink Champagne (AKA Phantom). The main appeal of Purple Champagne is her vibrant bud coloration, but sativa lovers will also appreciate the heady, mood-lifting effects this strain has to offer.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Purple Champagne\n \n 3. White Slipper\n\nWhite Slipper is a sativa-dominant hybrid that crosses The White and Glass Slipper, resulting in a relaxing strain perfect for shedding stress. Flavors of blueberry and spicy pepper take over on the inhale, and soon to follow is White Slipper’s heavenly euphoria. Its buds grow with shining resin-tipped trichomes that glow with a white luminescence, but let these potent crystals be a warning to novices: White Slipper’s THC content often exceeds 25 percent.\n\nWhite Slipper is currently available at Terrapin Care Station in Boulder, CO\n \n 4. Purple Martian Kush\n\nPurple Martian Kush is an indica-dominant cross between Purple Kush, Blackberry Kush, and Martian Mean Green. Its fluffy buds burst with fruity and berry aromas when broken apart, welcoming you to indulge in the euphoria Purple Martian Kush has to offer. Beginning in the head and radiating out to the rest of the body, this indica’s relaxing, blissful effects leave no muscles untouched.\n\nPurple Martian Kush is currently available at Beaver Bowls in Corvallis, OR\n \n 5. Cookie Wreck\n\nCookie Wreck, also called Cookie Trainwreck, is a hybrid cross between GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) and Trainwreck bred by CannaVenture Seeds. A subtle cookie-like aroma radiates from its dense buds, but more distinct fruity flavors come out on the exhale. This hybrid’s potency is enough to make both parents proud as its cerebral euphoria and full-body effects hit like a freight train.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Cookie Wreck\n \n 6. Alpha Express\n\nAlpha Express is an introspective sativa strain that descends from Alpha Blue and Ghost Train Haze. With a complex flavor that spans sour juniper and musky cedar notes, Alpha Express delivers spacey cerebral effects perfect for meditative or creative activities. Its buds bloom with trichome-covered calyxes that carry a red tint as the flowers mature.\n\nAlpha Express is currently available at The Farm in Boulder, CO\n \n 7. Ganesh Berry\n\nFrom Zion Botanicals comes Ganesh Berry, a hybrid cannabis strain that pulls genetics from Plushberry and a Northern Indian and Afghani hybrid. In small doses, Ganesh Berry provides focused and creative effects that can be enjoyed any time of the day. Up the dose and you’ll notice considerably heavier body sensations that relax muscles and tranquilize the mind. These effects are ushered in by a fusion of sweet fruity and berry flavors.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Ganesh Berry\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12002241/new-strains-alert-michael-phelps-og-white-slipper-ganesh-berry-co.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-michael-phelps-og-white-slipper-ganesh-berry-co"}],"reviewCount":6,"flavors":[{"name":"Diesel","score":53.125},{"name":"Earthy","score":50},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":6.25},{"name":"Sweet","score":3.125},{"name":"Berry","score":3.125}],"effects":[{"name":"Energetic","score":62.5},{"name":"Focused","score":56.25},{"name":"Talkative","score":53.125},{"name":"Happy","score":53.125},{"name":"Relaxed","score":53.125}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Insomnia","score":53.125},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":53.125},{"name":"Cramps","score":3.125},{"name":"Depression","score":3.125},{"name":"Fatigue","score":3.125}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":3.125},{"name":"Anxiety","score":3.125},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":3.125},{"name":"Migraines","score":3.125},{"name":"PTSD","score":3.125}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":56.25},{"name":"Anxious","score":50}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/alpha-express_100x100_fd73.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/566707/b/alpha-express__primary_4077.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/alpha-express_100x100_2151.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/497164/b/alpha-express__primary_99bc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/alpha-express_100x100_e619.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/408637/b/alpha-express__primary_9978.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":3,"popularCities":["Aptos, CA","Boulder, CO","Los Angeles, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/alpha-express","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.66666666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Alpha Blue","subtitle":null,"slug":"alpha-blue","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/alpha-blue","symbol":"Abl","applink":"leafly://strain/alpha-blue"},{"name":"Ghost Train Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"ghost-train-haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/ghost-train-haze","symbol":"Gth","applink":"leafly://strain/ghost-train-haze"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
