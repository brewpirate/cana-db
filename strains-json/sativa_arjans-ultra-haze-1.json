Bandana\nCharacteristics of Bandana:\n\nBandana is a hybrid strain that combines Banana OG and 707 Headband, inheriting from its parents a sweet banana aroma and the buzzing cerebral sensation that first lent Headband its name. On the exhale, Bandana unleashes its fruity flavor over subtle earthy and sour notes. Powerful, heady euphoria awakens blissful relaxation in the mind while leaving the body feeling light and free of couchlocked sedation.

Buffalo Bill\nCharacteristics of Buffalo Bill:\n\nBuffalo Bill is a sativa-dominant cross between Willie\u2019s Wonder and Killer Ken bred by New House Seeds and grown by Doc and Yeti\u2019s in Washington State. A blanket of crystal resin envelops the dense buds, almost hiding its interweaving green and lavender hues. Though 70% sativa by genetics, Buffalo Bill can hit with a force that leaves you anchored to your seat while the mind freely roams blissful euphoria. A sweet, earthy pine aroma floats from its kief-caked jar, sending your senses straight to a wintery tundra.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Dream Lotus\nCharacteristics of Dream Lotus:\n\nDream Lotus by Bodhi Seeds is a hybrid strain that was designed to recreate the widely cherished qualities of Blue Dream, but with an accentuated chunky bud structure. This rendition combines a Santa Cruz cut of Blue Dream with Bodhi\u2019s Snow Lotus, resulting in a strain that maintains uplifting< effects and a fragrant blueberry aroma. Hashy spice and sweet herbal notes can be detected on the exhale in a flavor that ushers in blissful effects perfect for stress relief any time of the day.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a04.

Four Cannabis Cup placements have won Arjan\u2019s Ultra Haze #1 a sterling reputation, but growers will have to wait with agonizing patience for its buds to finish their 13 weeks of flowering.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Alpine Star\nCharacteristics of Alpine Star:\n\nAlpine Star, often labeled as Alpine OG, is an earthy, citrus mix of Tahoe OG and Sensi Star genetics.

            "text": "Back in the day when this weird strain first came out and I saw Arjan and Franko publish their grow video  I was dying to try what they said was the best smoke, with the best taste, and the best feeling... I wasn't aware of how difficult it would be to get my hands on such a long-flowering strain. Fast forward about a decade... after a failed grow attempt I finally managed to get one mature organic, california-grown AU#1. It took almost 10 months to mature... This had better be good.\nI just rolled an Amsterdam tulip with AUH#1. Lit, toking... toking... taste.... nice Spicy, cheesy, minty, sweet-bell pepper-ish... no hint of anything fruity but a fennel-like sweetness in the aftertaste- this is perfect! not over pungent, not too strong, not harsh at all... literally the best balance to date I've ever tried. I could smoke this all day long, and love that sweet floral nose.\nI have experience. Other varieties I can compare this too are my organic Kali Mist, Arjan's Haze #3, Super Silver Haze but with greater sophistication and many subtle flavors and smells. Unlike these its very balanced with no one scent or flavor dominating the palate. Truly world-class connisseur cannabis.\nThe high... that surprised me. I felt a very mild sensation for about 10 minutes. So I smoked another. Then BAM! The biggest creeper ever! Im chilling sitting back on my chair and then I'm off into my thought world more clearly and more deeply then I have been in ages. This is serious stuff! But perfectly clear. \nI love to meditate, and for that many of the other verieties cloud my thinking. Not this, its like my internal mental fog is removed and I can think without anxiety and without pressure. This is by far the best strain I have tried. Not the strongest, the best.",
