Still riding that high from Star Wars: The Force Awakens? Consider checking out the high-CBD hybrid dubbed C3PO. More of a Total Recall fan? We got a strain for that, too: Kuato. Those and many others have been added, and you can find out if they\u0027re available near you by checking the links below. Happy strain hunting!\n \n   1. C3PO\n\nNamed after the eloquent and fussy droid from a galaxy far, far away, C3PO is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain cultivated in Humboldt County, California by Petrolia Farms. With the smell of fresh pine, C3PO delivers relaxing effects with mental clarity due to its high CBD content which usually falls between 13-15%. Minimal amounts of THC (less than 1%) mean this strain won’t cause the intense cerebral euphoria typically associated with high-THC varieties. Because of its CBD:THC ratio, medical patients might turn to this strain for treating pain, anxiety, and inflammation, among other symptoms and conditions.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying C3PO\n \n   2. Blue Mountain Fire\n\nA sativa strain with Jamaican roots, Blue Mountain Fire is an invigorating, upbeat variety that coerces creativity and happy mindsets.
