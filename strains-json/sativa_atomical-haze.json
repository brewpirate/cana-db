The foxtails have a rainbow coloration to them almost,even though they are predominantly green.\nSmell/Taste: The smell and taste a fairly light,but sweet fruity and pungent at the same time,very smooth. Nothing you will complain about\nEffects: The looks draw you in, but the effecta keep you. A verry positive and happy cerebral high comes over you, no energy rush like typical haze strains, a very blissful calmness takes you over. You can chill, go out, or sleep with this one, very versatile.i can feel pressure on my eyes , almost a headband feel.\nDefinetly worth a try, the high is very unique, the buds are beautiful even if the taste is on par withtodays strains.",
