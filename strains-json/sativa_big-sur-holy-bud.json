It was pretty trippy and make me appreciate light quality in a state of glittery awe.  The strain supported some good creative thought trains.  The buds are huge, and a little sloppy on the trim work, but beautiful none the less.  I would say the high is a little like super lemon haze, but a bit trippier and intense.  It\u2019s great from an immediate attitude adjustment and stress relief.",
