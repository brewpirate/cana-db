New varieties are born every day, so we\u0027d like to hear from you — which strains should we add next? Let us know in the comments below!\n \n  1. Blackberry Pie\n\nBlackberry Pie is a hybrid cross of Jojorizo’s Blackberry Widow and a Crystal Locomotive created by Gage Green Genetics. This hybrid is easy to grow and all phenotypes present the potency and high resin content you would expect given its White Widow and Trainwreck heritage. A beautiful and aromatic plant featuring flowers with deep purple hues and ample trichomes, Blackberry Pie offers a nice blend of heady euphoria with a medicinal body high.\n\n \n  2. Butter OG\n\nWhile there is not much information available on the origins of Butter OG, it is generally thought to be an indica-dominant strain as it gives users a very relaxing, giggly high that gradually fades to sleepiness. Its dense, sparkly buds give off a fruity scent with slight undertones of ammonia. The smoke is very light and smooth, with sweet flavors on the inhale and, like its name suggests, a buttery aftertaste. Butter OG is potentially beneficial for treating pain, anxiety, depression, and insomnia.\n\n \n  3. Blueberry Blast\n\nA mostly sativa hybrid from Snow High Seeds, Blueberry Blast is a the result of the famous Blueberry–Haze genetics of Blue Dream being pollinated by a Johnny Blaze male. These flowers smell strongly of blueberry, musk, and sweet candy, and taste like cedar and berries when smoked or vaped. A definite sativa effect is to be expected, with soaring, trippy highs that gradually fade into relaxation.\n\n \n  4. Mammoth\n\nThis hybrid from The Bank Cannabis Genetics is a cross between the sativa-dominant Snowcap and indica-dominant LA Confidential. There isn’t a lot of information available on Mammoth, but the breeder suggests that growers should look for phenotypes featuring the enormous yields of Snowcap, the shorter flowering time and manageable height of LA Confidential, and the dense buds, high potency, resin production, and disease resistance of both parents.\n\n \n  5. Khufu\n\nKhufu is an indica-dominant hybrid from The Devil’s Harvest Seed Company that combines Cheese, Afghani #1, and SFV OG genetics to excellent effect. Growers can expect extremely high yields of potent Kush-type flowers, with giant calyxes and very little leaf. The effects of Khufu will leave you wanting nothing more than to gorge on snacks while glued to your favorite chair. Patients treating pain, anxiety, nausea, and insomnia may benefit from Khufu’s therapeutic effects.\n\n \n  6. OG Skunk\n\nA cross between OG #18 and Skunk #1, OG Skunk is a 60% sativa-dominant hybrid from DNA Genetics. Flavors of sour fuel and skunky citrus are sure to please fans of both parent strains, while the high offers a nice uplifting head effect along with a relaxing body buzz. Its THC levels have been measured between 16% and 22%.\n\n \n  7. Merlot OG\n\nSoCal cannabis breeders Ocean Grown Seeds originally designed the Merlot OG in 2006 as an attempt to create an OG Kush-type plant with deep purple colors by crossing Larry OG and Grape Ape. The resulting plant was then crossed with Blackberry Rhino x SFV OG and then backcrossed to stabilize its OG characteristics. Merlot OG produces large, dense indica-type buds that are blanketed in white trichomes and will often turn dark purple, especially in cooler conditions.\n\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12002008/new-strains-alert-butter-og-blackberry-pie-khufu-mammoth-and-more.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-butter-og-blackberry-pie-khufu-mammoth-and-more"}],"reviewCount":19,"flavors":[{"name":"Blueberry","score":37.5},{"name":"Berry","score":26.25},{"name":"Sweet","score":16.25},{"name":"Pungent","score":10},{"name":"Earthy","score":8.75}],"effects":[{"name":"Energetic","score":135},{"name":"Creative","score":113.75},{"name":"Happy","score":45},{"name":"Uplifted","score":37.5},{"name":"Euphoric","score":32.5}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":18.75},{"name":"Pain","score":13.75},{"name":"Fatigue","score":12.5},{"name":"Stress","score":12.5},{"name":"Nausea","score":7.5}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":8.75},{"name":"Asthma","score":6.25},{"name":"PMS","score":6.25},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":6.25},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.25}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dizzy","score":15},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":13.75},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":13.75},{"name":"Anxious","score":13.75},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.5}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/blueberry-blast_100x100_4e58.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/501264/b/blueberry-blast__primary_a9cf.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Montréal, QC","Seattle, WA","Toronto, ON","Burlington, WA","Calgary, AB","Detroit, MI","Edmonton, AB","Hamilton, ON","Kirkland, WA","London, ON"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.47368421052632/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Blue Dream","subtitle":null,"slug":"blue-dream","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-dream","symbol":"Bd","applink":"leafly://strain/blue-dream"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
