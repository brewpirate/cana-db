(Leafs by Snoop Flowers are: 4 Dense, 2 Medium, and 2 spongey among my samples\nWhich is awesome !!! \nI couldn't be happier with all 8 \"cures\" of the Flowers, Bravo Team L.B.S. \n\nThis is a strain that Jane and John Public should be using and everyone will feel good and improve mood ! \n\nNo anxiety, no racing thoughts, no drugged feeling (it's listed at 14% THC and it feels like 14% :P \nIt's just a relaxed positive attitude ! \n\nI tried Blue Dream...\n(I rarely return to a strain unless it's real medicine, and I did not return. \n\nThis ISN'T Blue Dream !\nIt's BETTER ! \nI WILL return to this strain. \n\nThe smell is predominantly Ground Black Pepper \nAnd it only has a Blue hue when looked at a distance. \nThe inhale in NOT flavorful (most aren't) \n\nUnder magnification (LivWell has one to look at with before you buy) \nBlueberry Dream has easily the most trichomes of all 8 strains. \n\nThe paternal instincts in me make me want to suggest this to college kids as a FAR MORE ENJOYABLE HIGH that other higher THC strains that can lead to a \"bad trip\" \nOf course this means it's great for all newbies and or people who want the highs associated with getting high but not the lows \nThis is perfect for that ! \n\nI'm used to 20+% strains but many of them make me act nervous usually the 25+% strains are the culprits.\n\nThis is nothing like that strange uncomfortable feeling \n\nThis strain is what you need to be recommending to other Rec and Med Patients \n\nYour vision will NOT blur \nYou will NOT pass out \nYou WILL become more SOCIAL !!!\n& it DOES provide a relaxing BODY HIGH (It's obviously a HYBRID categorized incorrectly as Sativa \n\nYou WILL ENJOY this strain \n\nYou'll fall in love with \"her\" look omg \nYou'll smell Blueberries \nBut you won't taste them (that's normal) \nYou'll bomb the place out with the smoke smell \nAnd then...you'll be MASTER YODA \nand grinning from ear to ear \n\nWord Dogg \n",
