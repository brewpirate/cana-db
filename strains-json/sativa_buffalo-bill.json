It should be noted that a genetic variation of Silver Kush is marketed by some as a cross of Super Silver Haze and OG Kush.\n\n \n   5. Arjan\u0027s Ultra Haze #1\nCharacteristics of Arjan\u0027s Ultra Haze #1:\n\nArjan’s Ultra Haze #1 is a Dutch sativa bred by Green House Seeds, who combined Neville’s Haze with landrace strains from Cambodia and Laos. With mellow effects that stay cerebrally centered, this strain is perfect for those seeking introspective, meditative moments or a light, active buzz. Four Cannabis Cup placements have won Arjan’s Ultra Haze #1 a sterling reputation, but growers will have to wait with agonizing patience for its buds to finish their 13 weeks of flowering.\n\n \n   6. Alpine Star\nCharacteristics of Alpine Star:\n\nAlpine Star, often labeled as Alpine OG, is an earthy, citrus mix of Tahoe OG and Sensi Star genetics. Zesty lemon flavors lead Alpine Star’s wave of relaxing indica effects. The pain relieving properties of Alpine Star radiate from the head and neck, calming anxieties and muscle tension as the effects descend to the lower extremities.\n\n \n   7. Juicy Jack\nCharacteristics of Juicy Jack:\n\nJuicy Jack combines the tropical flavors of Juicy Fruit with the therapeutic attributes of Jack Herer. This hybrid is balanced between its indica and sativa heritage but its effects lean towards the creative, uplifting buzz associated with sativas. Juicy Jack creates a flavorful mouthful of sweet berry notes that mingle with a spiced, earthy musk to usher in a euphoric burst of heady effects.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/12002053/new-strains-alert-dream-lotus-juicy-jack-buffalo-bill-silver-kush.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-dream-lotus-juicy-jack-buffalo-bill-silver-kush"}],"reviewCount":17,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":5},{"name":"Woody","score":3.75},{"name":"Pine","score":3.75},{"name":"Sage","score":1.25},{"name":"Sweet","score":1.25}],"effects":[{"name":"Euphoric","score":11.25},{"name":"Relaxed","score":10},{"name":"Uplifted","score":7.5},{"name":"Happy","score":7.5},{"name":"Tingly","score":6.25}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":5},{"name":"Stress","score":3.75},{"name":"Fatigue","score":2.5},{"name":"Headaches","score":2.5},{"name":"Pain","score":2.5}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":2.5},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":2.5},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.25},{"name":"Crohn\u0027s Disease","score":1.25},{"name":"PTSD","score":1.25}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":6.25},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":2.5},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.25},{"name":"Headache","score":1.25},{"name":"Anxious","score":1.25}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/sativa/buffalo-bill/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/sativa/buffalo-bill/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/buffalo-bill_100x100_aeff.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/331566/b/buffalo-bill__primary_0b54.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/buffalo-bill_100x100_7a93.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/322445/b/buffalo-bill__primary_707b.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Vancouver, WA","Kirkland, WA","Los Angeles, CA","Lynnwood, WA","Mount Vernon, WA","Mukilteo, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/buffalo-bill","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.23529411764706/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Willy\u0027s Wonder","subtitle":null,"slug":"willys-wonder","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/willys-wonder","symbol":"Wil","applink":"leafly://strain/willys-wonder"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
