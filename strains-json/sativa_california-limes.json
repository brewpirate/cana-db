It\u0027s definitely a hybrid as it\u0027s both a head high, and full body high. It put me straight to sleep but had many impluses to clean something. Very strong desire for food, and it was so relaxing. I hurt my back and head really bad and bruised it all up yesterday, and I was in so much pain. I felt absolutely no pain after just a couple tokes off a joint.
