            "text": "Instrumental music exists outside the realm of vocalists, with guitar, horns, and keys filling the space with innovative instrumentation (known as instrumental interludes) where lyrics would normally reside. Though commonly associated with jazz, instrumental music is not limited to any single genre, and can even transcend genre altogether.\nThe beauty in instrumental music is its ability to push the boundaries of sound\u2014exploring and weaving in and out of its structure\u2014with an ease not afforded to lyrical constructs.\n\nBelow, discover five fantastic instrumental albums paired with the perfect strain and explore the vast range of sounds and possibilities instrumental music provides.\nFeeling Good by Dorothy Ashby\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Euforia\nReleased posthumously in 2015, Feeling Good is an incredible collection of harpist Dorothy Ashby\u2019s music that can\u2019t be missed. The 30-track album runs for nearly two hours and will leave no question as to why Ashby\u2019s prowess makes her one of the top instrumental artists to know and love. Her light, lovely, and versatile sound relaxes yet enlivens. Feeling Good is a feel-good instrumental jazz album with a fresh twist, as Ashby demonstrates the harp\u2019s use as a bebop instrument that is as engaging as any saxophone.\nFind Euforia Nearby\nJuice by Medeski, Martin, Scofield & Wood\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Candy Jack\nJuice, released in 2014, is the latest album from the dynamite quartet, Medeski, Martin, Scofield & Wood. The album contains all the signature versatility that Medeski, Martin & Wood bring to their albums, with the expert finesse and precision of legendary guitarist John Scofield. The eclectic 10-track album will keep you on your toes as it bends and twists through experimental and improvisational jazz fusion. Medeski\u2019s wizard-like ability to manipulate the keys and organ provokes creativity and a sense of playfulness that will keep you guessing and surprised from \u201cSham Time\u201d to \u201cThe Times They Are A-Changing.\u201d\nFind Candy Jack Nearby\n\nNomad (Remastered) by Lotus\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Fortune Cookies\nNomad was originally released in 2005, but the latest remastered and live version\u2014released in 2014\u2014is here to remind us all over again why we will always love this album. With funky, upbeat stylings and a full, rounded sound, Nomad wastes no time pulling you into its world\u2014and what a joyful world it is. Songs such as \u201cTravel\u201d incorporate light, melodic vocalizations, blended seamlessly so that they become a sort of instrumentation of their own. Nomad traverses landscapes, delivering transcendental bliss and danceable rhythms in a single album.\nFind Fortune Cookies Nearby\nMigration by Bonobo\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: 303 OG\nBonobo\u2019s Migration, released in 2017, is an extension of his unique sound and musical stylings. Each song is masterfully manipulated and crafted, flowing from one track to the next with versatility. Though Migration is electronically styled, Bonobo\u2019s use of real instruments creates a depth and soul within the music that is often lacking amongst electronic artists. And while the album incorporates lyrics on a few tracks, it is deftly woven into the soundscape the way any other instrument is intertwined. Migration explores a range of sounds and feelings, from upbeat tribal rhythms to soft, melodic, wordless ballads, making it an album that tells endless stories with every note.\nFind 303 OG Nearby\n\nGentlemen, I Neglected To Inform You You Will Not Be Getting Paid by Charlie Hunter\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Sweet Cheese\nWith a title reflecting the playfulness instilled in this instrumental album, Gentlemen, I Neglected To Inform You You Will Not Be Getting Paid is a modern jazz collection with a funky twist. Released in 2010, the album runs short at only 38 mins, but the pointed, swampy vibe and full sound, makes up for it. Hunter\u2019s guitar sails beside \u00a0a medley of drums, horns, and bass, creating a sound that is both precisely orchestrated and experimentally fun. This album will leave your mind stimulated even as you relax into every note.\nFind Sweet Cheese Nearby",

            "text": "In the sex education world, you\u2019ll hear people frequently refer to Yes/No/Maybe lists. The idea is that you sit down with a\u00a0list of sexual acts and assign each one as a \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d to indicate your level of interest in each one. Once you complete that portion on your own, you can share it with a partner or prospective partners so that they know what\u2019s on the table, what\u2019s negotiable, and what\u2019s off limits. It\u2019s a great jumping-off tool for negotiation and I highly recommend it as an exercise for any sexually active adult. If you want a great sexual Yes/No/Maybe list, check out this one from Sunny Megatron, host of Showtime\u2019s Sex with Sunny Megatron.\nRecently, it occurred to me that we don\u2019t have anything like that in the cannabis industry. Since my favorite thing is combining sex and cannabis, I thought it might be interesting to take a sexual tool like the Yes/No/Maybe list and give it a cannabis twist. I envision it working in two distinct but equally important ways.\n\nMaking a Yes/No/Maybe List\nFirst, a Yes/No/Maybe list can act as a way of communicating to your partner or even budtender what effects you\u2019re looking for. Think about the effects listed in Leafly\u2019s strain database, and decide which matter most to you:\n\nAroused\nCreative\nEnergetic\nEuphoric\nFocused\nGiggly\nHappy\nHungry\nRelaxed\nSleepy\nTalkative\n\n\u2026and so on. You can also list potential negatives that you want to be sure to avoid in a No column; for instance, while a cancer patient may be searching specifically for strains that induce hunger and put this characteristic on their Yes list, someone with a new year\u2019s resolution to watch their weight may put \u201chungry\u201d on their No list.\n\nOther negatives you may have experienced before and want to avoid can include:\n\nAnxious\nDizzy\nDry Eyes\nDry Mouth\nHeadache\n\nNow imagine you have this written out on a sheet of paper that you can give to your budtender and ask them to make a recommendation based on the things you want and need. Or if you or your partner are particularly cannabis savvy, you can use that list as a jumping-off point to plan your evening together and choose from strains and products you already have on hand.\nQuestions to Ask Before Consuming Cannabis\nYou also might consider asking pertinent questions before enjoying cannabis either on your own or with others. When did you eat last? How much do you typically consume and how\u2019s your tolerance? When you have bad reactions, how do they tend to manifest?\nI can imagine another variation\u00a0of this \u2013 a Yes/No/Maybe list for methods of consumption. There are so many out there, it\u2019d be good to get on the same page with your partner or friends. Some people never do edibles. Others avoid dabs at all costs. Some are equal opportunity consumers and are more than happy to enjoy cannabis in whatever method it\u2019s presented. Comparing lists with friends offers a way of creating a Venn diagram to see how you might best consume with others.\n\nThis past weekend, I was in Los Angeles for the Adult Novelty Manufacturing Expo. I brought four W Vapes pens, my Firefly 2 with some Deviant Dabs wax preloaded, low dose edibles, Foria, Hepburns ice water hash-infused pre-rolls, and a nug of Candy Jack. That\u2019s more than most people carry on them, I suspect, but I wanted to have options for my friends.\nIf I\u2019d thought of this cannabis Yes/No/Maybe list sooner, it would have been lovely to pull out a little sheet of paper where people could let me know their typical consumption preferences and what mood they were going for, so I could make suggestions accordingly. I would have also loved having a section where they could indicate the last time they\u2019d had a meal, how often and how much they usually consume, any medical conditions that may be a factor, or even just how they typically react when they\u2019ve had more than their body prefers.\nApplying the Yes/No/Maybe Concept to Cannabis\nSince the list is just a concept at the moment, I had to give recommendations on the fly at the conference. Luckily, everything worked out. That said, the cannabis industry can learn a lot from the sexuality education community: many sexuality tools and frameworks have been developed and honed over the last several decades, whereas the cannabis industry is just getting started.\nThe concepts of consent, negotiation, clear communication, boundaries, and intention setting can be easily applied to cannabis education, and it\u2019s important for everyone to be mindful with their cannabis use. Every time you pass someone a joint or offer a dab, you\u2019re impacting how they view the world of cannabis. Employing tools that facilitate mindful consumption will help shape the way the cannabis industry is viewed by those who might criticize it. Patient education will be more important than ever in the years to come, and offering frameworks will allow people to customize their experience and make it replicable.\nWould you use a cannabis Yes/No/Maybe list?
