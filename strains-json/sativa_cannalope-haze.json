            "text": "Sativa strains have long flourished in Mexico\u2019s hot climate, and these heirlooms have since propagated countless hybrids with their genetics. Here are just six of those descendants. To find out if they\u2019re available at a nearby shop, simply click the strain tile to navigate to its strain page and check its \u201cAvailability\u201d tab.\nAcapulco Gold\n\u00a0\nSaid to have originated in Acapulco, Mexico, this sativa is a colorful tangle of gold-orange pistils. With a sweet fruity flavor counterbalanced by earthy and spicy notes, Acapulco Gold provides a high-energy cerebral buzz that keeps you feeling stimulated throughout the day\u2019s festivities.\nMexican Sativa\n\u00a0\nThe breeders at Sensi Seeds managed to hunt down a sativa from Oaxaca and cross it with a Pakistani indica and the high-energy African sativa Durban Poison. The result was Mexican Sativa, a robustly uplifting strain with a fresh aroma of sandalwood and pine. The strong cerebral euphoria can verge on too trippy for some, but get to your happy place (at home, out for a hike, a grassy spot in the sun) and you\u2019re more likely to experience the rich sensory experience this sativa has to offer.\nCannalope Haze\n\u00a0\nCannalope Haze descends from Haze and a landrace strain from Mexico.\u00a0Cherished for its weightless euphoria and tropical flavors, it\u2019s the perfect strain for staying social and giggling. With aromas of sweet melon and wildflowers, Cannalope Haze is perfect for pairing with fresh fruits and floral cocktails.\nTrainwreck\n\u00a0\nThis hybrid mutt descends from Mexican and Thai sativas as well as Afghani indicas, creating a well-balanced experience that relaxes the body while lifting the mood. High in the citrusy terpene limonene, Trainwreck carries a pronounced lemon aroma with woody, earthy overtones. For those susceptible to social anxiety, this strain might be a better choice than the heady, racy sativas on this list.\nHaze\n\u00a0\nMaybe you\u2019ve never tried the original Haze, but if you\u2019re a fan of sativa strains, you\u2019re likely to have tried one of its hybrid progeny. Developed in the 1960s as a result of crossing Mexican, Thai, Colombian, and South Indian varieties, Haze has since become a cornerstone of sativa breeding. Spicy in flavor and energizing in effect, it\u2019s not hard to see why Haze belongs in your stash jar.\nNYPD\n\u00a0\nThough in no way Mexican by name, Nirvana Seeds\u2019 NYPD descends from a Mexican landrace strain known as \u201cEldorado\u201d and Aurora Indica. Funky diesel flavors are made sweet with dominant flavors of sweet lemon, and this sativa-dominant strain is known to provide a cerebral rush to keep your mind humming alive throughout the day\u2019s celebrations.",

The end of the month means a compilation of strain reviews that made us smile and the hilariously inventive Leafly users who submitted them.\u00a0 We ponder, we shudder, we giggle-snort.\u00a0Here\u2019s the best of the best of September:\nCinderella 99\nIn the world of celebrity strains, Cinderella 99 is totally a teen heartthrob.\n\n\u201cOn a scale of Steve buscemi to Channing Tatum\u2026it's defitnely a zac Efron.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBanana OG\nSometimes the joy that is food is so amplified by a good smoke session that you just might want to give that ice cream cone a big ol' hug.\n\n\"Smoked this. About 20 mins later I felt like a little girl skipping through a wheat field towards an ice cream with arms n legs before a choc chip cookie, also with arms and legs, skipped towards us making the happiest group hug I've ever had inside a baskin robbins. =)\"\n\nBlue Dream\nTMI, my friend. TMI.\n\n\"Very calm high, I feel nice an relaxed and when I pee, everything feels right.\"\n\nSpeaking of Blue Dream, here's another gem of a review. We really appreciate the apt\u00a0visualization here. What does blue taste like, exactly? What does dream taste like, either? 20th floor, please.\n\n\"You can really distinguish the blue from the dream. Had me up like an elevator going from the fourth floor to the twentieth.\"\n\nJack Herer\nApparently, Grandma really loved her wine\u2026\u2026and perhaps some Jack Herer?\n\n\"reminds me of my grandmas house\u2026smells heavily of wine grapes\"\n\nDeath Star\nThat thing's operational!\n\n\"after a few hits of this it was bye bye alderaan.\"\n\nSour Diesel\nYou say that and yet, here we are\u2026..\n\n\"I smoked too much of this. I shouldn't even be writing a review.\"\n\nCannalope Haze\n*Nods sagely*\n\n\"Hey, babe. Guess what?\" \"What?\" \"Part way through my whistling, I was wondering where the sound was coming from.\"\n\nAmnesia Haze\nI see what you did there.\n\n\"I think I smoked this before. I cant remember.\"\n\nGreen Crack\nSometimes you're Professor X, sometimes you're the\u00a0mutant punk on the run.\n\n\"Had me feeling like dr.xavier from the xmen hooked up to cerebro and mentally looking for punk rock mutants who were stoned in amsterdam. Never found them though.\"\n\nphoto credit (cropped): Kalexanderson via photopin cc",
