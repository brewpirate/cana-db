            "text": "Sweet potato fries are a popular means\u00a0of consuming sweet potatoes in North America \u2014 and in some parts of North America these fries are served with melted butter and honey on top of them. Growing up, this was one of my favorite treats to enjoy during the summer months down by the boat harbor. The sugary tart lemon and hints of mixed citrus with the haze in the Carnival strain I use in this recipe really make the dipping sauce in this dish pop, thus creating the perfect accompaniment to sweet potato fries.\nCarnival is a sativa-dominant strain that produces an intense soaring cerebral high that can become a bit overwhelming for first time consumers. But for those who are used to the strain\u2019s effects or whose chemistry vibes well, this strain will yield a beautiful euphoric and social high. It also relieves intense neck and shoulder pain, migraines, and ocular pressure\u00a0from glaucoma.\nCarnival is a highly medicinal and psychoactive strain that should be met with the proper respect. When respected correctly, it\u2019s sure to please the senses and enhance your sweet potato fries!\nCarnival Baked Sweet Potato Fries\nStart to finish: 30 minutes (10 minutes prep work)\nYields: 4 servings\nApproximate Dosage: 25\u00a0milligrams per serving*\nIngredients:\n\n4 sweet potatoes (or 2 extra-large sweet potatoes)\n2-3 tablespoons olive oil\n1 cup raw honey\n4 tablespoons room-temperature clarified\u00a0Carnival cannabutter\u00a0(see below)\n4 teaspoons cinnamon\nSea salt and pepper to taste\n\nTo clarify cannabutter:\u00a0Clarifying cooks out the water and whey components of the cannabutter. Add your standard\u00a0cannabutter to\u00a0a double boiler, then bring to a gentle boil and let the cannabutter cook slowly. Foam will rise to the top, then sink to the bottom. When the butter stops bubbling, all the water is gone \u2014 strain again through cheesecloth to remove the whey solids, and use as directed below.\nDirections:\n\nPreheat your oven to 450\u02daF. Cut your sweet potatoes into fries by hand or with a french fry cutter. You can alter\u00a0the thickness of the fry to match your own personal preferences. (If you end up making thick-cut steak fries, you\u2019ll want\u00a0to increase the cooking time.)\nAdd the olive oil to a bowl and toss your sweet potato fries until evenly coated. Lay your fries onto a baking sheet and\u00a0bake for 20 minutes or until browned and crisp.\nWhile your fries are baking, divide the raw honey into four servings of \u00bc cup each. To each serving of honey, add one tablespoon\u00a0Carnival-infused cannabutter and one teaspoon cinnamon in a ramekin. Combine all ingredients by stirring fast until fully incorporated.\nOnce your sweet potato fries are done baking, pull from the oven to season with sea salt and pepper. Plate a quarter of your fries with the cinnamon honey cannabutter dipping sauce and serve. You can also make this a low-dose appetizer in case you plan to follow up with another medicated dish: To do this, simply reduce the serving size of sauce\u00a0by whatever factor you wish.\n\nNotes:\n\nOn strain substitutions:\u00a0I would recommend strains that possess fruity tart terpenes that would pair well with the flavors of the Carnival strain. The following strains would be ideal if you didn\u2019t have Carnival:\u00a0Super Lemon Haze,\u00a0Lemon Drop,\u00a0Lemon Haze,\u00a0Tangie, and\u00a0Agent Orange. If you cannot find these strains don\u2019t panic, just follow your nose and taste buds to finds strains that would complement the dish. Have fun with it!\nOn dosing: If one gram of Carnival tests at 23% THC, it would contain\u00a0230mg of THC, so if you added one gram of this strain into the total recipe, each of the four servings would theoretically contain 57.5mg (sub the THC percentage of your own cannabis and do the same math to figure out your own theoretical dosage). That said, there are myriad chemical reactions that can reduce the potency of your cooking oil along the way, so the bars will likely contain decidedly less than that \u2013 probably closer to 25\u00a0milligrams per serving. Always sample a small portion of one serving first and wait a couple hours to see how it affects you before consuming more.\nOn altering the dosage: If you want a smaller dose, cut the cannabis down to a smaller amount so that it will be a micro dose. If you want a higher dose, add more Carnival flower to your cannabutter recipe.\n\n*Note: The amount of cannabutter specified in this recipe is a very loose suggestion; the actual amount you use should be modified based on the strength of your butter and the potency you desire. Dosing homemade edibles can be tricky (click here to learn why), so the best way to test for potency is to start with one portion of a serving, wait one to two hours, then make an informed decision on whether to consume more. Always dose carefully and listen to your body, and never drive under the influence of cannabis.",
