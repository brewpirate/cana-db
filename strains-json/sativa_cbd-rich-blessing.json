I've tried AC/DC, Cannatonic, Sour Tsunami, Suzy Q, and a few other high-CBD strains, and I love the effects from the RBL. \n\nBy itself, the effects are light, supportive, calming, and focusing. Not a hint of laziness anywhere for me with this strain. My head clears, I'm upbeat and energetic, but relaxed at the same time. The strain I've got has 1% or less THC, and it's barely noticeable at the edges of perception, but it's a nice blend. \n\nOf my few favorite strains, this is one. It is consistently in my cupboard right next to the other strains I'm careful not to run out of. Highly recommended medical strain, but hard to find. One place in my somewhat small area so far has it, but I'm attempting to find more places or possibly buy a seed/grow a RBL plant this summer.",
