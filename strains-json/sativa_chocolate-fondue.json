Hits pretty fast with a very electric, euphoric, uplifting and soaring head buzz. Like the description says, the high is very trance-like and blissful in its own unique way. The taste was different, nothing like I\u0027ve tasted before in a herb. It did have unmistakable undertones of sweet coffee and chocolate. The body high that accompanies is both relaxing and high function able. In all, the combination of the two helped with picking me up in the morning, just like a coffee would do, and inspire me to achieve my goals and dreams every day! Good for depression, self reflection/introspective, creativity, anxiety, appetite, nausea and stress. Didn\u0027t help so much with pain, but man can this stuff settle down an upset stomach and relieve mental woes","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/bn1HUI7tvLyn0Fkk1dLIMSCvROQ=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fUxAMHptTuuQR3BjlU2Hc_nerd-purple.png"},{"id":1411951,"username":"Rufftattoo","text":"Vapourized in the pax 2; \nSmells cheesey and subtle tastes of chocolate on the exhale.\nShared with brother-in law and he was overwhelmed with the taste.

There are indicas, sativas, and hybrids, not to mention the full spectrum of flavors these strains produce — everything from sweet and skunky to fruity and floral. The effects these strains produce highlight many of the reasons that people consume cannabis, both for its medicinal value and the recreational experience.\nIf you\u0027ve come across any of these tempting strains while searching the menu of your favorite dispensary, make sure you leave a review. But if you don\u0027t find one here that sparks your interest, try digging through the Leafly Strain Explorer — we\u0027re updating it all the time with suggestions from the Leafly community!\n \n 1. Chocolate Fondue\n\nChocolate Fondue, bred by DNA Genetics, is a sativa-dominant cross that balances the uplifting effects of Chocolope with the relaxing effects and unique flavors of Exodus Cheese. The effects of Chocolate Fondue relax the body and calm the mind into a blissful state of consciousness. Its complex bouquet and sweet flavors make this cannabis strain enjoyable day or night.\n\n \n 2. GI001\n\nGI001 is a sativa-dominant cannabis strain developed by one of Growth Industries’ botanists. This strain is characterized by a lime green plant color, citrus taste, and high yields during cultivation. With little to no psychoactive effects, GI001 is a great alternative for those who don’t want their medication to interfere with daily activities. Through Growth Industries’ medical grade, standardized cultivation policies and procedures, GI001 boasts a CBD to THC ratio of 24:1 on a consistent basis. Currently, Growth Industries’ strains are only available through authorized vendors and pharmaceutical raw material outlets.\n\n \n 3. Milky Way\n\nMilky Way is an 80/20 indica-dominant blend bred by Kiwiseeds. Named for the milky white trichomes that cover its buds and sugar leaves, Milky Way has a sweet aroma with flavors of sugar and spice. Its effects are characterized as potent, relaxing, and full-bodied thanks to the heavy indica influence.\n\n \n 4. Ebola #7\n\nEbola #7, also known as THCbola, is a blend of two popular California strains. It was created in the summer of 2012 when HendRx Farms’ breeders crossed SFV OG with GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies). After an extensive phenotype hunt, #7 was selected for its high concentrations of THC that range between 24% – 28% depending on cultivation methods. Ebola #7 received its unique name after it unintentionally spread throughout gardens in Humboldt County.\n\n \n 5. Heisenberg Kush\n\nHeisenberg Kush is a cross of SC Blue Dream and Sin City Kush bred by Alphakronik Genes Seeds as part of their Great Minds series of genetics. Named for the renowned German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who is considered the pioneer of quantum mechanics, Heisenberg Kush is a fast-flowering, sativa-dominant blend that produces a spectrum of blue and purple hues. Skunky grape notes mix with earthy undertones of sandalwood and a sweet strawberry finish to create the invigorating flavor palate of Heisenberg Kush.\n\n \n 6. Purple Pantera\n\nPurple Pantera is an indica-dominant hybrid bred by Snowhigh Seeds. The mix of Pink Panther and Grape Krush genetics produces dark purple hues and a piney OG Kush aroma that is highlighted by sweet grape notes with subtle berry undertones. This strain\u0027s fast-acting effects spark bursts of euphoria and deep relaxation that is best saved for the end of the day.\n\n \n 7. Sin City Kush\n\nSin City Kush is an 80/20 indica-dominant cross of LVPK and Snowdawg bred by Alphakronik Genes Seeds. The buds of Sin City Kush are a mix of deep purple and green hues with a glossy coat of white trichomes and a compelling floral aroma. Don’t expect to accomplish much when trying Sin City Kush — the indica influence weighs heavy on the body and mind, so this strain is best enjoyed after your daily tasks are complete.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/12002028/new-strains-alert-chocolate-fondue-gi001-ebola-7-more.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-chocolate-fondue-gi001-ebola-7-more"}],"reviewCount":32,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":19.696969696969695},{"name":"Cheese","score":14.393939393939393},{"name":"Earthy","score":12.121212121212121},{"name":"Pepper","score":3.0303030303030303},{"name":"Pungent","score":3.0303030303030303}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":35.606060606060609},{"name":"Relaxed","score":31.818181818181817},{"name":"Focused","score":27.27272727272727},{"name":"Creative","score":25.757575757575758},{"name":"Energetic","score":24.242424242424242}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":25.757575757575758},{"name":"Stress","score":25.757575757575758},{"name":"Fatigue","score":12.121212121212121},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":6.0606060606060606},{"name":"Nausea","score":5.3030303030303028}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":13.636363636363635},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":11.363636363636363},{"name":"PTSD","score":9.8484848484848477},{"name":"Arthritis","score":3.7878787878787881},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":2.2727272727272729}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":22.727272727272727},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":18.18181818181818},{"name":"Dizzy","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Headache","score":1.5151515151515151},{"name":"Anxious","score":0.75757575757575757}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolate-fondue_100x100_50a0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/584661/b/chocolate-fondue__primary_ee75.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolate-fondue_100x100_4952.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/565010/b/chocolate-fondue__primary_884c.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolate-fondue_100x100_e599.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/491086/b/chocolate-fondue__primary_a491.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolate-fondue_100x100_aee8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/491242/b/chocolate-fondue__primary_85cc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolate-fondue_100x100_89cb.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/407843/b/chocolate-fondue__primary_e7e0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolate-fondue_100x100_07d3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/407751/b/chocolate-fondue__primary_687e.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":8,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Bremerton, WA","Custer, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-fondue","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.5625/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Exodus Cheese","subtitle":null,"slug":"exodus-cheese","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/exodus-cheese","symbol":"Exo","applink":"leafly://strain/exodus-cheese"},{"name":"Chocolope","subtitle":null,"slug":"chocolope","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/chocolope","symbol":"Chc","applink":"leafly://strain/chocolope"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tHeavy feeder\n\n"}}
