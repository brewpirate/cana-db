Leafly and General Hydroponics are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: A spin on the landrace classic Chocolate Thai, Chocolope pulls in genetics from another parent strain, Cannalope Haze. This sativa strain holds onto the rich chocolate coffee flavor of Chocolate Thai while adding extra sweetness from Cannalope Haze. The high is dreamy and uplifting, and may remind some consumers of travels to Thailand when Thai sticks were available on the backpackers’ route.\nGrow Techniques: Chocolope grows well inside, but give it plenty of space as it tends to grow big without close training. Grow in soil or hydro, and top the plant to promote development from the bottom branches. Chocolope takes a good amount of time to flower but not as long as its parent, Chocolate Thai.\nFlowering Time: 8-9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Easy\nClimate: Performs best between 68-80 degrees Fahrenheit. Grow outdoors in a dry, warm climate, or keep this plant inside to protect the buds.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Though Chocolate Thai can handle high humidity, its large buds can potentially be ruined by mold in moist climates.\nFeeding: Light to moderate feeding will keep this plant happy, making it great for novice growers looking to produce a sativa strain.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/23160337/chocolope-cannabis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/growing/how-to-grow-chocolope-marijuana"}],"reviewCount":1111,"flavors":[{"name":"Coffee","score":37.055426719430372},{"name":"Sweet","score":28.586815454661505},{"name":"Earthy","score":27.734635405585578},{"name":"Woody","score":9.71377104520375},{"name":"Tropical","score":6.4936953037459393}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":65.832748251847434},{"name":"Uplifted","score":63.1620285661603},{"name":"Relaxed","score":50.351580783796436},{"name":"Euphoric","score":50.243518006325971},{"name":"Energetic","score":46.06559295349134}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":41.774906741557096},{"name":"Depression","score":34.9298079514347},{"name":"Fatigue","score":18.807267066649647},{"name":"Pain","score":12.501684325489695},{"name":"Nausea","score":5.8576408096109382}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":21.784002099201455},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":8.6951973674879071},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":7.2800980100137576},{"name":"PTSD","score":3.880951874388324},{"name":"Arthritis","score":3.2284973689062872}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":19.108672680595149},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":13.012212246287392},{"name":"Dizzy","score":6.2048778066181569},{"name":"Anxious","score":4.4481263208657786},{"name":"Paranoid","score":4.398128448434818}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/sativa/chocolope/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/sativa/chocolope/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolope_100x100_b5a8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1003458/b/chocolope__primary_be4b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolope_100x100_8afe.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002815/b/chocolope__primary_ab3e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolope_100x100_e759.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1001478/b/chocolope__primary_8186.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolope_100x100_b9e7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/674090/b/chocolope__primary_0d3d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolope_100x100_284b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/667341/b/chocolope__primary_f999.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/chocolope_100x100_aa22.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/665621/b/chocolope__primary_aef2.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":188,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Portland, OR","Vancouver, BC","Calgary, AB","Denver, CO","Montréal, QC","Edmonton, AB","Bellevue, WA","Spokane, WA","Bellingham, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/chocolope","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.31503150315031/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Chocolate Thai","subtitle":null,"slug":"chocolate-thai","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-thai","symbol":"Cht","applink":"leafly://strain/chocolate-thai"},{"name":"Cannalope Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"cannalope-haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/cannalope-haze","symbol":"Cah","applink":"leafly://strain/cannalope-haze"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":63,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":"High","environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tPrefers moderate amounts of fertilizer\n\tMay express fruity or diesel-smelling phenotypes\n\tTrains well as a multi-branched plant or with sea of green (SOG) operations\n\tAverage yield falls between 250-300 grams per plant\n\n"}}
