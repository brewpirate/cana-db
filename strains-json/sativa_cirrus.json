A little goes a long way though... very heady effects that make it feel like your head is a balloon floating here and there, a bit trippy. Visuals can also get a bit trippy with light trails and an intense focus. But beware, smoke too much and you\u2019re bound to experience an altered state of being that may be too overwhelming for newbie smokers... A truely euphoric and out-of-this-world experience for those who are experienced. This is a 15/10 High ;) ",
