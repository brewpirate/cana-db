            "text": "From the mountains of Colombia to the hills of China, we'd like to introduce you to some new strains that will expand your global palate. Genetics from the U.K. contributed to the birth of OG Cheese and Cheesewreck, two potent hybrids that deliver jarring euphoria with that unmistakable sour smell from Cheese. Colombian Gold is a classic sativa landrace strain from South\u00a0America, and China Yunnan was bred using native genetics from southern China. Last, we've added Schrom, a sativa-dominant strain from the U.S.\u00a0that fills the room with a pungent lemon and lime aroma.\nAre these strains in your corner of the world? Rate and review the ones you've tried, and let us know if they're worth seeking out!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. OG Cheese\nCharacteristics of OG Cheese:\n\nHybrid strain\nCross between OG Skunk #1 and Afghani\nSour cheese aroma\nPresents a dreamy, euphoric buzz\nIndoor flowering time of 50 to 60 days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.
