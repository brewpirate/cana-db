            "text": "Oh my! \n\nAnother of the doc\u2019s favourite strains, I was lucky to procure this from an op in Canada. Boy does it hit the spot, right... right there!!!\n\nIn the jar, this smells SO enticing. Raw fruit and fresh pine overload the nose quickly and release with the pine lingering. \n\nStarting at 180C in the vape, first few notes are tangy pine, minty and sweet fruit. That classic pinene profile you remember from other strains like Love Potion #1. After a while it turns into a herby but sweet pine concoction - definitely mellows out over time but stays tangy, sweet and herby. \n\n15 - 20 minutes in and the euphoria kicks in, gently, and brings with it the opening of that tight chest from your anxiety and stress. Goodbye worries of the day, hello talking shit and feeling good for the next few hours :)\n\nThis didn\u2019t smash me sideways, but definitely deserves the 5 stars! Super gentle and clear high that leaves your faculties pretty much intact. I would try this is it comes available near you, even if you prefer a sativa \n\n",
