Zero residual haziness, if consumed in a small doobie in the morning. Top 5 sativas. Super uplifted long lasting high. Smoke a small doobie in the morning and your whole day as if you drank the best cup of coffee. Maximum productivity zero haziness. Very hard not to do so every morning, as your mood is good the whole day without reason to smoke again till night. Really the kind of stuff that makes you wonder if cannabis has any negative effect on productivity. Nice, dense, sticky nugs, caked with THC, I’m guessing this is upwards of 20% THC but no info on that matter.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1595591,"username":"michael.smith.562343","text":"Phenom, superstar, the best cannabis I have ever discovered for doing weight workouts. It\u0027s energetic without being too racy like some sativas. The buds are very airy and wispy compared to the tight nug strains that this gets bread into. It stinks like ammonia when it\u0027s really fresh and slowly loses the harsh smell and turns into a more sweeter smell. I highly recommend you try it if you\u0027re an athlete and like to have some cannabis pre/post workout.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":8,"flavors":[{"name":"Ammonia","score":31.25},{"name":"Diesel","score":31.25},{"name":"Sweet","score":31.25},{"name":"Pungent","score":31.25},{"name":"Lemon","score":25}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":75},{"name":"Energetic","score":75},{"name":"Happy","score":75},{"name":"Euphoric","score":37.5},{"name":"Focused","score":37.5}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":43.75},{"name":"Stress","score":37.5},{"name":"Pain","score":31.25},{"name":"Fatigue","score":25},{"name":"Inflammation","score":6.25}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":18.75},{"name":"Anxiety","score":12.5},{"name":"Arthritis","score":6.25},{"name":"Asthma","score":6.25},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":6.25}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":25}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[],"photoTotalCount":0,"popularCities":["Vancouver, BC","Toronto, ON","Montréal, QC","Calgary, AB","Edmonton, AB","Brampton, ON","Mississauga, ON","Ottawa, ON","Victoria, BC","Winnipeg, MB"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/congo","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Pakistani Chitral Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"pakistani-chitral-kush","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/pakistani-chitral-kush","symbol":"Pck","applink":"leafly://strain/pakistani-chitral-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
