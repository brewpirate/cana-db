            "text": "Pure clear headed euphoria and energy. Zero residual haziness, if consumed in a small doobie in the morning. Top 5 sativas. Super uplifted long lasting high. Smoke a small doobie in the morning and your whole day as if you drank the best cup of coffee. Maximum productivity zero haziness. Very hard not to do so every morning, as your mood is good the whole day without reason to smoke again till night. Really the kind of stuff that makes you wonder if cannabis has any negative effect on productivity. Nice, dense, sticky nugs, caked with THC, I\u2019m guessing this is upwards of 20% THC but no info on that matter.",

            "text": "Phenom, superstar, the best cannabis I have ever discovered for doing weight workouts. It's energetic without being too racy like some sativas. The buds are very airy and wispy compared to the tight nug strains that this gets bread into. It stinks like ammonia when it's really fresh and slowly loses the harsh smell and turns into a more sweeter smell. I highly recommend you try it if you're an athlete and like to have some cannabis pre/post workout.",
