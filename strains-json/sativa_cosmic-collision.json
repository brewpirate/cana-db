            "text": "Space: the final frontier. The massively empty wonder which has tantalized the imagination of mankind since first gazing upwards to witness the brilliance of the celestial. Whether for discovery, in reaction to climate change, or because you\u2019re an overly excited core that wants to go to space, exploration is more relevant and possible than ever. With private space companies reigniting the torch of space travel and helmed by incredibly smart and innovative individuals (like Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, or Sir Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic), it\u2019s not hard to believe we are entering a golden age of cosmological discovery.\nOn the shoulders of giants we stride forward into a future not grounded on Earth. Here at Leafly, we\u2019d like to reengage the booster switch and combust a little propellant in honor of the men and women around the world making the dream of space exploration a reality. We\u2019ve compiled a list of outer space-themed cannabis strains to help you celebrate the scientists, star formations, conspiratorial UFO hunters, Apollo missions, and others on this Space Exploration Day.\n\u00a0\u00a0Project Blue Book\nOriginating in 1952, Project Blue Book kicked off a series of studies conducted by the U.S. Air Force to determine if UFOs were a threat to national security. Its strain counterpart is a sativa-leaning hybrid offering a serene body high and calm, focused effects that are perfect for star-gazing.\n\u00a0\u00a0Sputnik\nThis rocket was used by the Soviet Union to perform the world\u2019s first satellite launch in 1957. Strain-wise, the spunky Sputnik sativa (say that three times fast!) has hints of sour and diesel, perhaps from that rocket boost of uplifting effects you may experience.\n\u201c2 hits to liftoff. Decent buzz out of the launchpad. mid buzz nice and headize, no burn out at the end. good strain to kick back, and rate strains.\u201d \u2013 sonofabrokenman\n\u00a0\u00a0Apollo 11\nThe first space flight that brought humans on the Moon, Apollo 11 is the reason we\u2019re celebrating this date today since it occurred on July 20th, 1969. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind. The strain, meanwhile, offers strong cerebral effects that are good for treating stress and moderate pain.\n\u201cI love this strain. It takes you on a cosmic journey while leaving you grounded on planet earth. \u2013symbol9991\n\u00a0\u00a0Stephen Hawking Kush\nThe iconic theoretical physicist brought us predictions on black holes, gravitational singularity theorems, and cosmology. His strainsake, Stephen Hawking Kush, is an indica-dominant offering that helps with pain, nausea, and relaxation.\n\u201cHealing codes from the universe immediately came to me when I smoked a hit of this high 11.4 CBD strain. Absolutely Smiles and TOTAL RELEIF are endrenching me in this dream. My love of indica just got greater because I have had a crush on Stephen Hawking and now I can smoke bud named after his fine ass and mind. WOW I think this strain will make me more intelligent. It is so much stonier and higher than I thought it \u2026\u201d \u2013 StellarStoner\n\u00a0\u00a0Apollo 13\nThe seventh manned mission in the Apollo space program, Apollo 13 was the United States\u2019 third intended Moon landing. Unfortunately, an oxygen tank exploded and crippled the Service Module. The crew managed to cobble together some makeshift repairs and return safely to Earth on April 17th. Not only did this historical event result in a blockbuster film of the same name, it also inspired the popular Apollo 13 hybrid strain featuring cerebral, energizing effects and an appropriately earthy scent.\n\u201cWOW! Such an appropriate name, because I\u2019m blasted light years past the moon. Light speed ahead, on a rocket ship I said, catch me if you can, I\u2019m your spaceman\u2026\u201d \u2013NunoFreak\n\u00a0\u00a0Cosmic Collision\nThis sativa collided Cosmic Charlie with Pi\u00f1a Collision to create a fusion that\u2019s out of this world. Enjoy the pineapple-kiwi flavors of Cosmic Collision and its uplifting, euphoric effects while you ponder exactly how far the universe extends.\n\u00a0\u00a0Carl Sagan\nThe American astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, and astrobiologist dedicated his efforts to researching extraterrestrial life and sent the first physical messages into space. His Carl Sagan strain counterpart offers balanced effects and relaxation.\n\u00a0\u00a0Outer Space\nDefined as the void that exists between celestial bodies, the mystery of outer space will keep scientists hunting for answers well into the next millennium. The sativa Outer Space is widely touted for its creative, uplifting, and energetic effects.\n\u201cReally makes you feel like taking off into space. More of a head uplifting feeling and focus.\u201d \u2013 robmorales\n\u00a0\u00a0Nebula\nA nebula is an interstellar cloud comprised of dust, helium, hydrogen, and other ionized gases. Its hybrid Nebula strain version twinkles with THC coating and offers intense, almost psychedelic effects.\n\u201cOut of this world!\u201d \u2013 hermantheworm420",

            "text": "It's Friday and you know what that means: new strains! Oh yeah. Here are just 10 of the many new varieties added to the Leafly database this week. If any of them look familiar to you, leave a review sharing your thoughts! Also, be sure to check out more details on where to find these strains near you by navigating to their strain pages. Happy strain hunting!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Pineapple Purple Skunk\n\nBred by MTG Seeds, Pineapple Purple Skunk is a hybrid cannabis strain that combines Pineapple and Purple Skunk genetics. Together, these parent strains pass on a sweet and sour blend of fruity and berry flavors. Pineapple Purple Skunk blooms in vibrant hues of purple and green and shows resilience against mold.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Green Lantern\n\nGreen Lantern is a mostly sativa strain whose undocumented history poses frustrations for genetic enthusiasts. While some rumors mark the 1960s as Green Lantern\u2019s beginning, others tell us that Green Lantern is a newer strain that resulted from crossing Green Crack and White Rhino. Whatever its parentage may be, Green Lantern inherits mellow euphoric effects and a peppery pine aroma comparable to that of Jack Herer. Its aroma suggests the presence of caryophyllene and pinene, which are terpenes that fight inflammation and promote focus.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Afghan Sour Kush\n\nAfghan Sour Kush is an indica-dominant cross between Afghani and Sour Kush. Its heavy, relaxing effects are ushered in by a sweet berry aroma and a sharp spicy flavor typical of Kush varieties. Stout and sturdy, Afghan Sour Kush plants have tight internodal spacing and finish flowering in about 60 days.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Medibud\n\nMedibud (or Medi Bud) is an uplifting hybrid strain of unknown genetic origins, but many attribute its upbeat, active effects to sativa parentage. Others claim Medibud is a 60/40 indica-dominant cross, so it\u2019s possible that this strain expresses itself in various phenotypes. Typically, you can expect high-energy euphoria and heightened sensory awareness from Medibud, but its indica-leaning phenotypes may induce heavier, more relaxing effects.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Black Cherry OG\n\nBlack Cherry OG is an indica strain bred by Grand Daddy Purple that combines Ken\u2019s OG with an unknown Granddaddy Purple hybrid. Dense buds take on an intense purple hue at the end of Black Cherry OG\u2019s maturation and develop a sweet aroma like fruity tea. Relaxing full-body effects take over, ridding you of pain and insomnia while lifting the mood.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Cosmic Collision\n\nCosmic Collision is a sativa-dominant strain from MTG Seeds, who crossed Cosmic Charlie and Pi\u00f1a Collision into a fusion that boasts both flavor and potency. The exhale releases a tropical medley of pineapple and kiwi that hints at the Pineapple in this strain\u2019s lineage. Uplifting and euphoric, Cosmic Collision offers a brighter outlook for those suffering from stress and depression.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Heaven Scent\n\nHeaven Scent is a hybrid cannabis strain that crosses genetics from God\u2019s Gift and Green Crack. The polar opposite effects of its indica and sativa parents meet halfway, delivering you to a balanced state of blissful, relaxed happiness. Its buds express themselves in hues that range from deep blue to dark purple.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08. Godfather Purple Kush\n\nGodfather Purple Kush is an indica-dominant cross between Godfather, Purple Kush, and Afghani. This trifecta of indica genetics come together to produce heavy effects that ease your mind and body into full relaxation. Its dark purple buds give off an earthy, spicy aroma accented by sweet notes of berry.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09. Sour Strawberry Diesel\n\nSour Strawberry Diesel is a hybrid cross between Sour Strawberry and Turbo Diesel. With a sweet and spicy aroma, Sour Strawberry Diesel delivers a warm, uplifting buzz that melts away stress and bad moods. Its flowers grow into chunky buds with red and purple hues following its 8 to 9 week flowering cycle.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010. Cherry Diesel\n\nCherry Diesel combines Cherry OG and Turbo Diesel into one sweet-smelling, uplifting hybrid strain. Its plants bloom with dense, sticky buds that give off a fragrant cherry aroma after its 8 to 9 week flowering cycle.",
