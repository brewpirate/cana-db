The bud were very small and super fluffy, and was as if somebody poured a tub of sugar over it after. Just absolutely covered in trichomes. I am hearing that this bud take 8-12 weeks to harvest and that the longer you wait with this strain, the mores potent the strain will be. But more importantly, the yields are huge and plentiful. To me the strain smells like straight chemicals and blue cheese, and I LOVE IT. The buds almost remind me of like a chemdawgish look with a dark hint of purplish green running up thru it and the sugar coat upon the buds. I'm and indica guy, but this is a really great Sativa.",
