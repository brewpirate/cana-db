All the while, cannabis enthusiasts have been inventing and appropriating a whole lexicon specific to their industry, including a nomenclature that sincerely bastardizes subjects of conspiracy, mythology, and import. This week’s New Strains Alert is dedicated to innovators and rebels with the heart and humor to laugh in the face of an uphill battle toward legalization. Take a hit and exhale a confident breath of subversion. We are winning. \n \n  Ape Shit\n\nApe Shit is the genetic offspring of three quality cannabis strains. By crossing Purple Urkle, Acapulco Gold, and Cinderella 99, this hybrid strain blends deep body effects against bright, heady mental energy. Certain phenotypes exhibit a strong grape odor, but typically this strain smells of lavender with a touch of sweetness. Enjoy this strain as a means to quell depression and anxiety.\n\n \n  Devil\u0027s Tit\n\nDevil’s Tit from SnowHigh Seeds is a potent heart-pounding speed demon that will put even the most seasoned sativa enthusiast to the test. A sativa cross between Durban Poison, Acapulco Gold, and Cinderella 99, this strain provides an exhilarating body high that makes for an excellent one-hitter-quitter or a welcome challenge for sativa lovers looking to test their boundaries. Avoid this strain if you suffer from anxiety, as the effects will naturally get your heart racing.\n\n \n  Opium\n\nOpium by Paradise Seeds is an even 50/50 hybrid that offers the best of both indica and sativa strains. This strain won 2nd place at the 2006 High Times Cannabis Cup and has grown in popularity since. Known to flourish indoors, this plant grows fat, resinous colas when hydroponics are employed. Outside, this strain is a different beast, growing more fickle in guerrilla cropping conditions.\n\n \n  Acid\n\nAcid is Paradise Seeds’ take on the original New York Sour Diesel. Expect powerful body effects, including an uplifted, nearly psychedelic mental energy. This plant exhibits a metallic flavor that is representative of its namesake, with traditional notes of gas on the nose. Acid thrives in both indoor and outdoor environments, finishing in about 9 to 10 weeks.\n\n \n  Martian Candy\n\nMartian Candy (also known as Martian Candy OG) is a indica-dominant hybrid with an aroma that is out of this world. This strain smells rich with herbaceous notes and just a hint of eucalyptus. It leans heavily on the body, lowering the eyes immediately after the first puff. Its strong body buzz expands gradually, relaxing the limbs to the point of sedation with continued use. Martian Candy is ideal for patients suffering from stress, anxiety, PTSD, and nausea.\n\n \n  Majestic 12\n\n3C Majestic 12 satisfies all the requirements of a delicious ‘purple’ strain. Leaves of violet and purple? Check. Dense with frosty trichomes and orange pistols? Check. Deep, sweet earthy flavor? Check. Extremely relaxing on the mind and body? Check. This strain is named for a secret committee of scientists, military, and government officials organized to investigate and recover an alien spacecraft—an apt title for this hybrid blend of Space Queen and Obama OG. It hits the mind first, but is closely followed by total body relaxation. Majestic 12 is preferred by patients looking to tackle anxiety and pain at the same time.\n\n \n  Illuminati OG\n\n3C Illuminati OG is a direct cut from Josh D’s 1996 Club 33 OG phenome and makes up the genetic backbone of many west coast cannabis varieties. In spite of its ubiquity, its origins remain a debatable mystery (as its name suggests). The colas are a blend of beautiful green tones and its scent is fresh and piney. Illuminati’s denseness hits the tongue with a blast of pine and a touch of tar, just to be followed by a subtle floral sweetness. Its effects set in very quickly, starting with a relaxation that begins at the crown of the head and melts over the entire body.\n\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12001933/new-strains-alert-ape-shit-devils-tit-illuminati-and-more.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-ape-shit-devils-tit-illuminati-and-more"}],"reviewCount":12,"flavors":[{"name":"Tropical","score":100},{"name":"Mango","score":100},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":26.923076923076923},{"name":"Pepper","score":26.923076923076923},{"name":"Earthy","score":25}],"effects":[{"name":"Focused","score":128.84615384615384},{"name":"Tingly","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Creative","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Energetic","score":51.92307692307692},{"name":"Relaxed","score":3.8461538461538463}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Headaches","score":103.84615384615384},{"name":"Stress","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Insomnia","score":100},{"name":"Depression","score":1.9230769230769231},{"name":"Fatigue","score":1.9230769230769231}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Migraines","score":100},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":100}],"negatives":[{"name":"Anxious","score":51.92307692307692},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":25},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":25},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.9230769230769231}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/devil-s-tit_100x100_2976.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/515857/b/devil-s-tit__primary_f4d9.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Everett, WA","Seattle, WA","Shoreline, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/devils-tit","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.16666666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Durban Poison","subtitle":null,"slug":"durban-poison","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/durban-poison","symbol":"Dp","applink":"leafly://strain/durban-poison"},{"name":"Acapulco Gold","subtitle":null,"slug":"acapulco-gold","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/acapulco-gold","symbol":"Aca","applink":"leafly://strain/acapulco-gold"},{"name":"Cinderella 99","subtitle":null,"slug":"cinderella-99","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderella-99","symbol":"C99","applink":"leafly://strain/cinderella-99"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Acid thrives in both indoor and outdoor environments, finishing in about 9 to 10 weeks.\n\n \n  Martian Candy\n\nMartian Candy (also known as Martian Candy OG) is a indica-dominant hybrid with an aroma that is out of this world. This strain smells rich with herbaceous notes and just a hint of eucalyptus. It leans heavily on the body, lowering the eyes immediately after the first puff. Its strong body buzz expands gradually, relaxing the limbs to the point of sedation with continued use. Martian Candy is ideal for patients suffering from stress, anxiety, PTSD, and nausea.\n\n \n  Majestic 12\n\n3C Majestic 12 satisfies all the requirements of a delicious ‘purple’ strain. Leaves of violet and purple? Check. Dense with frosty trichomes and orange pistols? Check. Deep, sweet earthy flavor? Check. Extremely relaxing on the mind and body? Check. This strain is named for a secret committee of scientists, military, and government officials organized to investigate and recover an alien spacecraft—an apt title for this hybrid blend of Space Queen and Obama OG. It hits the mind first, but is closely followed by total body relaxation. Majestic 12 is preferred by patients looking to tackle anxiety and pain at the same time.\n\n \n  Illuminati OG\n\n3C Illuminati OG is a direct cut from Josh D’s 1996 Club 33 OG phenome and makes up the genetic backbone of many west coast cannabis varieties. In spite of its ubiquity, its origins remain a debatable mystery (as its name suggests). The colas are a blend of beautiful green tones and its scent is fresh and piney. Illuminati’s denseness hits the tongue with a blast of pine and a touch of tar, just to be followed by a subtle floral sweetness. Its effects set in very quickly, starting with a relaxation that begins at the crown of the head and melts over the entire body.\n\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12001933/new-strains-alert-ape-shit-devils-tit-illuminati-and-more.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-ape-shit-devils-tit-illuminati-and-more"}],"reviewCount":12,"flavors":[{"name":"Tropical","score":100},{"name":"Mango","score":100},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":26.923076923076923},{"name":"Pepper","score":26.923076923076923},{"name":"Earthy","score":25}],"effects":[{"name":"Focused","score":128.84615384615384},{"name":"Tingly","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Creative","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Energetic","score":51.92307692307692},{"name":"Relaxed","score":3.8461538461538463}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Headaches","score":103.84615384615384},{"name":"Stress","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Insomnia","score":100},{"name":"Depression","score":1.9230769230769231},{"name":"Fatigue","score":1.9230769230769231}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":101.92307692307692},{"name":"Migraines","score":100},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":100}],"negatives":[{"name":"Anxious","score":51.92307692307692},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":25},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":25},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.9230769230769231}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/devil-s-tit_100x100_2976.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/515857/b/devil-s-tit__primary_f4d9.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Everett, WA","Seattle, WA","Shoreline, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/devils-tit","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.16666666666667/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Durban Poison","subtitle":null,"slug":"durban-poison","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/durban-poison","symbol":"Dp","applink":"leafly://strain/durban-poison"},{"name":"Acapulco Gold","subtitle":null,"slug":"acapulco-gold","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/acapulco-gold","symbol":"Aca","applink":"leafly://strain/acapulco-gold"},{"name":"Cinderella 99","subtitle":null,"slug":"cinderella-99","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderella-99","symbol":"C99","applink":"leafly://strain/cinderella-99"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

All the while, cannabis enthusiasts have been inventing and appropriating a whole lexicon specific to their industry, including a nomenclature that sincerely bastardizes subjects of conspiracy, mythology, and import. This week’s New Strains Alert is dedicated to innovators and rebels with the heart and humor to laugh in the face of an uphill battle toward legalization. Take a hit and exhale a confident breath of subversion. We are winning. \n \n  Ape Shit\n\nApe Shit is the genetic offspring of three quality cannabis strains. By crossing Purple Urkle, Acapulco Gold, and Cinderella 99, this hybrid strain blends deep body effects against bright, heady mental energy. Certain phenotypes exhibit a strong grape odor, but typically this strain smells of lavender with a touch of sweetness. Enjoy this strain as a means to quell depression and anxiety.\n\n \n  Devil\u0027s Tit\n\nDevil’s Tit from SnowHigh Seeds is a potent heart-pounding speed demon that will put even the most seasoned sativa enthusiast to the test. A sativa cross between Durban Poison, Acapulco Gold, and Cinderella 99, this strain provides an exhilarating body high that makes for an excellent one-hitter-quitter or a welcome challenge for sativa lovers looking to test their boundaries. Avoid this strain if you suffer from anxiety, as the effects will naturally get your heart racing.\n\n \n  Opium\n\nOpium by Paradise Seeds is an even 50/50 hybrid that offers the best of both indica and sativa strains. This strain won 2nd place at the 2006 High Times Cannabis Cup and has grown in popularity since. Known to flourish indoors, this plant grows fat, resinous colas when hydroponics are employed. Outside, this strain is a different beast, growing more fickle in guerrilla cropping conditions.\n\n \n  Acid\n\nAcid is Paradise Seeds’ take on the original New York Sour Diesel. Expect powerful body effects, including an uplifted, nearly psychedelic mental energy. This plant exhibits a metallic flavor that is representative of its namesake, with traditional notes of gas on the nose. Acid thrives in both indoor and outdoor environments, finishing in about 9 to 10 weeks.\n\n \n  Martian Candy\n\nMartian Candy (also known as Martian Candy OG) is a indica-dominant hybrid with an aroma that is out of this world. This strain smells rich with herbaceous notes and just a hint of eucalyptus. It leans heavily on the body, lowering the eyes immediately after the first puff. Its strong body buzz expands gradually, relaxing the limbs to the point of sedation with continued use. Martian Candy is ideal for patients suffering from stress, anxiety, PTSD, and nausea.\n\n \n  Majestic 12\n\n3C Majestic 12 satisfies all the requirements of a delicious ‘purple’ strain. Leaves of violet and purple? Check. Dense with frosty trichomes and orange pistols? Check. Deep, sweet earthy flavor? Check. Extremely relaxing on the mind and body? Check. This strain is named for a secret committee of scientists, military, and government officials organized to investigate and recover an alien spacecraft—an apt title for this hybrid blend of Space Queen and Obama OG.

In spite of its ubiquity, its origins remain a debatable mystery (as its name suggests). The colas are a blend of beautiful green tones and its scent is fresh and piney.
