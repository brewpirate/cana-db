            "text": "The cannabis industry is well on its way to becoming a legitimate and respectable contributor to medicine, the economy, and popular culture in the United States. We\u2019ve come a long way since the dawn of stoner stigmas, and Leafly\u2019s primary goal is to promote worldwide acceptance of marijuana consumption beyond the usual stereotypes. But the market hasn\u2019t always been as polished and PC as it is today, and we still have a lot of work to do.\nBrowse our database of strains and you\u2019ll notice a few that stick out like sore thumbs amidst marketable monikers like Blue Dream, White Lotus, and Strawberry Kush. Some cannabis breeders are much less serious when it comes time to name their new genetic creation, and this list showcases the best of the worst \u2013 the dirtiest, the weirdest, the most NSFW strains in the history of cannabis.\n\u00a0\n1. Wet Dream\n\nThere are a ton of strains out there that induce severe horniness in some individuals (trust us, we read enough detailed and personal strain reviews to know). But, as far as we know, this sativa strain didn\u2019t get its name from a night of magical, sexy, THC-fueled dreams. Wet Dream is just a cleverly named genetic cross between parent strains Blue Dream and Ocean Beach Haze.\n\u00a0\n2. MILF\n\nThe MILF strain was popularized by the Showtime series \u201cWeeds\u201d as the main character\u2019s signature product, but it\u2019s also a strain that exists in the real world. After hearing the way some growers talk about their \u201csexy ladies\u201d in the garden, you might suspect that MILF was created by some dendrophiliac who gets off to marijuana plants nearing the end of their maturation cycle. Nope. It\u2019s just a cheeky acronym for \u201cMarijuana I\u2019d Like to Flower.\u201d\n\u00a0\n3. Purple Monkey Balls\n\nThe history of Purple Monkey Balls is, for the most part, shrouded in mystery. But if we were to guess how its birth story went, it probably went something like:\n\"Once upon a time, there lived a dude that thought poop jokes and penis cartoons were the best thing ever. One day while tending his pot garden, the dude noticed his plants blooming with large, round, purple buds covered in wiry orange pistil hairs. \u2018How testicular and primate-like these are,\u2019 he noted with impeccable perception. \u2018\u2026Purple Monkey Balls. Yes. Who wouldn't smoke that?' And it was so.\"\n\u00a0\n4. XXX OG\n\nWARNING: this strain contains somewhat hardcore levels of THC. Consumer discretion is advised. So yeah, this is a super potent indica strain that's said to have aphrodisiac qualities, but take in too much XXX OG and you\u2019re more likely to find yourself uselessly slumped on the couch than in the bedroom making sexy times.\n\u00a0\n5. Dirty Girl\n\nNot sure if people just expect arousal with a name like Dirty Girl, but there are enough horndog Leafly reviews to question the power of placebo. It\u2019s easy to see Dirty Girl having a positive influence on the libido, though: the effects are energizing, functional, and just euphoric enough to turn a good night into a really, really, really ridiculously good night.\n\u00a0\n6. Alaskan Thunder Fuck\n\nDespite having a name that would offend all those who keep a swear jar in their home, Alaskan Thunder Fuck remains a timeless classic that won\u2019t be leaving the market any time soon. Some medical marijuana dispensaries abbreviate it to \u201cATF\u201d on their menus to keep up appearances, but one might argue that this doesn\u2019t provide fair warning of the thundering cerebral mindf*ck to come.\n\u00a0\n7. Asian Fantasy\n\nYeah, there\u2019s no exciting back story to Asian Fantasy. Her name's the only reason she's on this list.\n\u00a0\nHave you come across any other cringe-tastic, dirty, or downright NSFW strains? Leave a comment with your favorites!",

Worry not, there are plenty of\u00a0other new varieties\u00a0waiting!\n\u00a0 \u00a01. Sensi Skunk\nCharacteristics of Sensi Skunk:\n\nSensi Skunk from Sensi Seeds is a potent\u00a0Skunk #1\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that offers a\u00a0sweet and citrus\u00a0flavor in contrast with the\u00a0earthy,\u00a0herbal\u00a0aroma typical of Skunk varieties. The\u00a0indica-driven effects produce a calm and\u00a0euphoric\u00a0buzz that\u00a0relaxes\u00a0tense muscles and alleviates\u00a0stress. A great choice for indoor gardeners, Sensi Skunk boasts a short flowering cycle with heavy yields. Sensi Seeds has also released feminized and auto-flowering versions for those looking to streamline the cultivation process.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a02. Dirty Girl\nCharacteristics of Dirty Girl:\n\nDirty Girl is a\u00a0sativa-dominant cross of a\u00a0Trainwreck\u00a0hybrid, known as Arcata Lemon Wreck, and\u00a0Cinderella\u00a099. The combination produces a\u00a0tropical\u00a0aroma of\u00a0pineapples, citrus, and\u00a0fruit, with a sharp\u00a0pungent\u00a0note reminiscent of Pine Sol.\u00a0The flavor of Dirty Girl is like\u00a0sweet\u00a0lemon\u00a0candy and the effects it produces are\u00a0happy\u00a0and\u00a0creative. Dirty Girl will elevate your mood and help avoid the complications of\u00a0depression,\u00a0anxiety, and\u00a0migraines\u00a0/ headaches.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a03. Game Changer\nCharacteristics of Game Changer:\n\nThe 60/40\u00a0indica-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0Game Changer is a clone-only strain plausibly named for its ability to pivot bad moods, aches, and pains. It descends from California\u2019s\u00a0Purple Dragon\u00a0and Thailand\u2019s\u00a0landrace\u00a0sativa known as Green\u00a0Thai, and this genetic fusion is evident in Game Changer\u2019s twisting hues of vibrant green and deep purple.\u00a0Floral\u00a0notes sit quietly under a loud aroma of\u00a0tropical fruit\u00a0and\u00a0grape\u00a0in a show of this hybrid\u2019s complex\u00a0terpene\u00a0profile. Whether it\u2019s day or night, Game Changer offers unencumbered\u00a0euphoria\u00a0perfect for those looking to ease into the cannabis waters.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a04. Blue Monster\nCharacteristics of Blue Monster:\n\nBlue Monster is a powerful combination of\u00a0G13,\u00a0Blueberry,\u00a0Northern Lights #5, and a\u00a0Mexican\u00a0landrace\u00a0strain. Bred by Goldenseed, Blue Monster combines a\u00a0sweet\u00a0mix of flavors with strong\u00a0indica\u00a0effects. Its complex aroma of\u00a0berries\u00a0and\u00a0tropical\u00a0fruits\u00a0exposes the influence of Blueberry and G13 genetics. When grown to its full potential, the forceful\u00a0relaxation\u00a0of Blue Monster can overwhelm novices with its immediate body sedation and commanding cerebral effects. This monster indica is sure to scare away\u00a0sleepless nights\u00a0and body\u00a0pains.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. White Diesel\nCharacteristics of White Diesel:\n\nWhite Diesel is a\u00a0sativa-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that mixes the resinous\u00a0White Widow\u00a0with the\u00a0pungent\u00a0flavors of\u00a0NYC Diesel. The buds from White Diesel produce a zesty combination of\u00a0lemon,\u00a0grapefruit, and the\u00a0diesel\u00a0fumes that we\u2019ve come to expect from\u00a0Sour Diesel\u00a0varieties. The effects are a well-rounded mix of an\u00a0uplifting\u00a0sativa head buzz with mellow body\u00a0relaxation. Medical patients enjoy White Diesel\u2019s ability to ward off\u00a0anxiety\u00a0and\u00a0depression, and for combating\u00a0migraines\u00a0and\u00a0gastrointestinal disorders.",

You have NO clue what the hell happened, but you can't wait for it to happen again! Say hello to Dirty Girl. She's not sporting the biggest nugs and she smells like an elderly lime fucking last year's Christmas tree, but she's a complete and total freak. You think you're the one on top? Take a couple of hits -- yeah, who's the bitch now? That's right, YOU are . . . and daaaaamn it feels good! Dirty girl wants you to relax and just let it flow while she takes over. And she's cheap, too: I've found her for $8 a gram. She's not the kind of girl you bring home to your mother, but if you've got a Saturday night and some low lights, give her a try.
