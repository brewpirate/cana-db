We’ve come a long way since the dawn of stoner stigmas, and Leafly’s primary goal is to promote worldwide acceptance of marijuana consumption beyond the usual stereotypes. But the market hasn’t always been as polished and PC as it is today, and we still have a lot of work to do.\nBrowse our database of strains and you’ll notice a few that stick out like sore thumbs amidst marketable monikers like Blue Dream, White Lotus, and Strawberry Kush. Some cannabis breeders are much less serious when it comes time to name their new genetic creation, and this list showcases the best of the worst – the dirtiest, the weirdest, the most NSFW strains in the history of cannabis.\n \n1. Wet Dream\n\nThere are a ton of strains out there that induce severe horniness in some individuals (trust us, we read enough detailed and personal strain reviews to know). But, as far as we know, this sativa strain didn’t get its name from a night of magical, sexy, THC-fueled dreams. Wet Dream is just a cleverly named genetic cross between parent strains Blue Dream and Ocean Beach Haze.\n \n2. MILF\n\nThe MILF strain was popularized by the Showtime series “Weeds” as the main character’s signature product, but it’s also a strain that exists in the real world. After hearing the way some growers talk about their “sexy ladies” in the garden, you might suspect that MILF was created by some dendrophiliac who gets off to marijuana plants nearing the end of their maturation cycle. Nope. It’s just a cheeky acronym for “Marijuana I’d Like to Flower.”\n \n3. Purple Monkey Balls\n\nThe history of Purple Monkey Balls is, for the most part, shrouded in mystery. But if we were to guess how its birth story went, it probably went something like:\n\"Once upon a time, there lived a dude that thought poop jokes and penis cartoons were the best thing ever. One day while tending his pot garden, the dude noticed his plants blooming with large, round, purple buds covered in wiry orange pistil hairs. ‘How testicular and primate-like these are,’ he noted with impeccable perception. ‘…Purple Monkey Balls. Yes. Who wouldn\u0027t smoke that?\u0027 And it was so.\"\n \n4. XXX OG\n\nWARNING: this strain contains somewhat hardcore levels of THC. Consumer discretion is advised. So yeah, this is a super potent indica strain that\u0027s said to have aphrodisiac qualities, but take in too much XXX OG and you’re more likely to find yourself uselessly slumped on the couch than in the bedroom making sexy times.\n \n5. Dirty Girl\n\nNot sure if people just expect arousal with a name like Dirty Girl, but there are enough horndog Leafly reviews to question the power of placebo. It’s easy to see Dirty Girl having a positive influence on the libido, though: the effects are energizing, functional, and just euphoric enough to turn a good night into a really, really, really ridiculously good night.\n \n6. Alaskan Thunder Fuck\n\nDespite having a name that would offend all those who keep a swear jar in their home, Alaskan Thunder Fuck remains a timeless classic that won’t be leaving the market any time soon. Some medical marijuana dispensaries abbreviate it to “ATF” on their menus to keep up appearances, but one might argue that this doesn’t provide fair warning of the thundering cerebral mindf*ck to come.\n \n7. Asian Fantasy\n\nYeah, there’s no exciting back story to Asian Fantasy. Her name\u0027s the only reason she\u0027s on this list.\n \nHave you come across any other cringe-tastic, dirty, or downright NSFW strains?

Worry not, there are plenty of other new varieties waiting!\n   1. Sensi Skunk\nCharacteristics of Sensi Skunk:\n\nSensi Skunk from Sensi Seeds is a potent Skunk #1 hybrid that offers a sweet and citrus flavor in contrast with the earthy, herbal aroma typical of Skunk varieties. The indica-driven effects produce a calm and euphoric buzz that relaxes tense muscles and alleviates stress. A great choice for indoor gardeners, Sensi Skunk boasts a short flowering cycle with heavy yields. Sensi Seeds has also released feminized and auto-flowering versions for those looking to streamline the cultivation process.\n\n   2. Dirty Girl\nCharacteristics of Dirty Girl:\n\nDirty Girl is a sativa-dominant cross of a Trainwreck hybrid, known as Arcata Lemon Wreck, and Cinderella 99. The combination produces a tropical aroma of pineapples, citrus, and fruit, with a sharp pungent note reminiscent of Pine Sol. The flavor of Dirty Girl is like sweet lemon candy and the effects it produces are happy and creative. Dirty Girl will elevate your mood and help avoid the complications of depression, anxiety, and migraines / headaches.\n\n   3. Game Changer\nCharacteristics of Game Changer:\n\nThe 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid Game Changer is a clone-only strain plausibly named for its ability to pivot bad moods, aches, and pains. It descends from California’s Purple Dragon and Thailand’s landrace sativa known as Green Thai, and this genetic fusion is evident in Game Changer’s twisting hues of vibrant green and deep purple. Floral notes sit quietly under a loud aroma of tropical fruit and grape in a show of this hybrid’s complex terpene profile. Whether it’s day or night, Game Changer offers unencumbered euphoria perfect for those looking to ease into the cannabis waters.\n\n   4. Blue Monster\nCharacteristics of Blue Monster:\n\nBlue Monster is a powerful combination of G13, Blueberry, Northern Lights #5, and a Mexican landrace strain. Bred by Goldenseed, Blue Monster combines a sweet mix of flavors with strong indica effects. Its complex aroma of berries and tropical fruits exposes the influence of Blueberry and G13 genetics. When grown to its full potential, the forceful relaxation of Blue Monster can overwhelm novices with its immediate body sedation and commanding cerebral effects. This monster indica is sure to scare away sleepless nights and body pains.\n\n   5. White Diesel\nCharacteristics of White Diesel:\n\nWhite Diesel is a sativa-dominant hybrid that mixes the resinous White Widow with the pungent flavors of NYC Diesel. The buds from White Diesel produce a zesty combination of lemon, grapefruit, and the diesel fumes that we’ve come to expect from Sour Diesel varieties. The effects are a well-rounded mix of an uplifting sativa head buzz with mellow body relaxation. Medical patients enjoy White Diesel’s ability to ward off anxiety and depression, and for combating migraines and gastrointestinal disorders.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002351/new-strains-alert-sensi-skunk-dirty-girl-game-changer-blue-monste.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-sensi-skunk-dirty-girl-game-changer-blue-monste"}],"reviewCount":156,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":24.964609499713863},{"name":"Pine","score":22.044516731423752},{"name":"Lemon","score":13.1253576699497},{"name":"Flowery","score":11.185657058522334},{"name":"Earthy","score":10.57422969187675}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":78.467516038673523},{"name":"Energetic","score":59.01177675371224},{"name":"Uplifted","score":50.729646697388631},{"name":"Euphoric","score":46.033252010481604},{"name":"Relaxed","score":42.174934489925}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":45.685370922562569},{"name":"Depression","score":39.0327098581368},{"name":"Pain","score":31.252823710129213},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":15.592903828197946},{"name":"Fatigue","score":15.555254359808439}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":21.068642510767745},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":7.2686063672780934},{"name":"PTSD","score":5.0231920725279355},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.2061986084756482},{"name":"PMS","score":3.879401222854733}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":21.759886750399083},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":8.4500466853408032},{"name":"Dizzy","score":7.95985060690943},{"name":"Headache","score":7.4696545284780571},{"name":"Paranoid","score":3.0834914611005688}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_6839.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/670092/b/dirty-girl__primary_3d22.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_dda6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/525393/b/dirty-girl__primary_e2c1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_1106.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/510319/b/dirty-girl__primary_258f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_c6ab.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/501483/b/dirty-girl__primary_8a0e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_613f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/464579/b/dirty-girl__primary_83c1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_813e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/462886/b/dirty-girl__primary_0924.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":16,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Spokane, WA","Everett, WA","Lynnwood, WA","Mount Vernon, WA","Shoreline, WA","Bellingham, WA","Bremerton, WA","Spokane Valley, WA","Bothell, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.51282051282051/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Cinderella 99","subtitle":null,"slug":"cinderella-99","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderella-99","symbol":"C99","applink":"leafly://strain/cinderella-99"},{"name":"Trainwreck","subtitle":null,"slug":"trainwreck","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck","symbol":"Tw","applink":"leafly://strain/trainwreck"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

Worry not, there are plenty of other new varieties waiting!\n   1. Sensi Skunk\nCharacteristics of Sensi Skunk:\n\nSensi Skunk from Sensi Seeds is a potent Skunk #1 hybrid that offers a sweet and citrus flavor in contrast with the earthy, herbal aroma typical of Skunk varieties. The indica-driven effects produce a calm and euphoric buzz that relaxes tense muscles and alleviates stress. A great choice for indoor gardeners, Sensi Skunk boasts a short flowering cycle with heavy yields. Sensi Seeds has also released feminized and auto-flowering versions for those looking to streamline the cultivation process.\n\n   2. Dirty Girl\nCharacteristics of Dirty Girl:\n\nDirty Girl is a sativa-dominant cross of a Trainwreck hybrid, known as Arcata Lemon Wreck, and Cinderella 99. The combination produces a tropical aroma of pineapples, citrus, and fruit, with a sharp pungent note reminiscent of Pine Sol. The flavor of Dirty Girl is like sweet lemon candy and the effects it produces are happy and creative. Dirty Girl will elevate your mood and help avoid the complications of depression, anxiety, and migraines / headaches.\n\n   3. Game Changer\nCharacteristics of Game Changer:\n\nThe 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid Game Changer is a clone-only strain plausibly named for its ability to pivot bad moods, aches, and pains. It descends from California’s Purple Dragon and Thailand’s landrace sativa known as Green Thai, and this genetic fusion is evident in Game Changer’s twisting hues of vibrant green and deep purple. Floral notes sit quietly under a loud aroma of tropical fruit and grape in a show of this hybrid’s complex terpene profile. Whether it’s day or night, Game Changer offers unencumbered euphoria perfect for those looking to ease into the cannabis waters.\n\n   4. Blue Monster\nCharacteristics of Blue Monster:\n\nBlue Monster is a powerful combination of G13, Blueberry, Northern Lights #5, and a Mexican landrace strain. Bred by Goldenseed, Blue Monster combines a sweet mix of flavors with strong indica effects. Its complex aroma of berries and tropical fruits exposes the influence of Blueberry and G13 genetics. When grown to its full potential, the forceful relaxation of Blue Monster can overwhelm novices with its immediate body sedation and commanding cerebral effects. This monster indica is sure to scare away sleepless nights and body pains.\n\n   5. White Diesel\nCharacteristics of White Diesel:\n\nWhite Diesel is a sativa-dominant hybrid that mixes the resinous White Widow with the pungent flavors of NYC Diesel. The buds from White Diesel produce a zesty combination of lemon, grapefruit, and the diesel fumes that we’ve come to expect from Sour Diesel varieties. The effects are a well-rounded mix of an uplifting sativa head buzz with mellow body relaxation. Medical patients enjoy White Diesel’s ability to ward off anxiety and depression, and for combating migraines and gastrointestinal disorders.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002351/new-strains-alert-sensi-skunk-dirty-girl-game-changer-blue-monste.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-sensi-skunk-dirty-girl-game-changer-blue-monste"}],"reviewCount":156,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":24.964609499713863},{"name":"Pine","score":22.044516731423752},{"name":"Lemon","score":13.1253576699497},{"name":"Flowery","score":11.185657058522334},{"name":"Earthy","score":10.57422969187675}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":78.467516038673523},{"name":"Energetic","score":59.01177675371224},{"name":"Uplifted","score":50.729646697388631},{"name":"Euphoric","score":46.033252010481604},{"name":"Relaxed","score":42.174934489925}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":45.685370922562569},{"name":"Depression","score":39.0327098581368},{"name":"Pain","score":31.252823710129213},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":15.592903828197946},{"name":"Fatigue","score":15.555254359808439}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":21.068642510767745},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":7.2686063672780934},{"name":"PTSD","score":5.0231920725279355},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.2061986084756482},{"name":"PMS","score":3.879401222854733}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":21.759886750399083},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":8.4500466853408032},{"name":"Dizzy","score":7.95985060690943},{"name":"Headache","score":7.4696545284780571},{"name":"Paranoid","score":3.0834914611005688}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_6839.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/670092/b/dirty-girl__primary_3d22.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_dda6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/525393/b/dirty-girl__primary_e2c1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_1106.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/510319/b/dirty-girl__primary_258f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_c6ab.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/501483/b/dirty-girl__primary_8a0e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_613f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/464579/b/dirty-girl__primary_83c1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_813e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/462886/b/dirty-girl__primary_0924.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":16,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Spokane, WA","Everett, WA","Lynnwood, WA","Mount Vernon, WA","Shoreline, WA","Bellingham, WA","Bremerton, WA","Spokane Valley, WA","Bothell, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.51282051282051/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Cinderella 99","subtitle":null,"slug":"cinderella-99","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderella-99","symbol":"C99","applink":"leafly://strain/cinderella-99"},{"name":"Trainwreck","subtitle":null,"slug":"trainwreck","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck","symbol":"Tw","applink":"leafly://strain/trainwreck"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

We’ve come a long way since the dawn of stoner stigmas, and Leafly’s primary goal is to promote worldwide acceptance of marijuana consumption beyond the usual stereotypes. But the market hasn’t always been as polished and PC as it is today, and we still have a lot of work to do.\nBrowse our database of strains and you’ll notice a few that stick out like sore thumbs amidst marketable monikers like Blue Dream, White Lotus, and Strawberry Kush. Some cannabis breeders are much less serious when it comes time to name their new genetic creation, and this list showcases the best of the worst – the dirtiest, the weirdest, the most NSFW strains in the history of cannabis.\n \n1. Wet Dream\n\nThere are a ton of strains out there that induce severe horniness in some individuals (trust us, we read enough detailed and personal strain reviews to know). But, as far as we know, this sativa strain didn’t get its name from a night of magical, sexy, THC-fueled dreams. Wet Dream is just a cleverly named genetic cross between parent strains Blue Dream and Ocean Beach Haze.\n \n2. MILF\n\nThe MILF strain was popularized by the Showtime series “Weeds” as the main character’s signature product, but it’s also a strain that exists in the real world. After hearing the way some growers talk about their “sexy ladies” in the garden, you might suspect that MILF was created by some dendrophiliac who gets off to marijuana plants nearing the end of their maturation cycle. Nope. It’s just a cheeky acronym for “Marijuana I’d Like to Flower.”\n \n3. Purple Monkey Balls\n\nThe history of Purple Monkey Balls is, for the most part, shrouded in mystery. But if we were to guess how its birth story went, it probably went something like:\n\"Once upon a time, there lived a dude that thought poop jokes and penis cartoons were the best thing ever. One day while tending his pot garden, the dude noticed his plants blooming with large, round, purple buds covered in wiry orange pistil hairs. ‘How testicular and primate-like these are,’ he noted with impeccable perception. ‘…Purple Monkey Balls. Yes. Who wouldn\u0027t smoke that?\u0027 And it was so.\"\n \n4. XXX OG\n\nWARNING: this strain contains somewhat hardcore levels of THC. Consumer discretion is advised. So yeah, this is a super potent indica strain that\u0027s said to have aphrodisiac qualities, but take in too much XXX OG and you’re more likely to find yourself uselessly slumped on the couch than in the bedroom making sexy times.\n \n5. Dirty Girl\n\nNot sure if people just expect arousal with a name like Dirty Girl, but there are enough horndog Leafly reviews to question the power of placebo. It’s easy to see Dirty Girl having a positive influence on the libido, though: the effects are energizing, functional, and just euphoric enough to turn a good night into a really, really, really ridiculously good night.\n \n6. Alaskan Thunder Fuck\n\nDespite having a name that would offend all those who keep a swear jar in their home, Alaskan Thunder Fuck remains a timeless classic that won’t be leaving the market any time soon. Some medical marijuana dispensaries abbreviate it to “ATF” on their menus to keep up appearances, but one might argue that this doesn’t provide fair warning of the thundering cerebral mindf*ck to come.\n \n7. Asian Fantasy\n\nYeah, there’s no exciting back story to Asian Fantasy. Her name\u0027s the only reason she\u0027s on this list.\n \nHave you come across any other cringe-tastic, dirty, or downright NSFW strains?

We’ve come a long way since the dawn of stoner stigmas, and Leafly’s primary goal is to promote worldwide acceptance of marijuana consumption beyond the usual stereotypes. But the market hasn’t always been as polished and PC as it is today, and we still have a lot of work to do.\nBrowse our database of strains and you’ll notice a few that stick out like sore thumbs amidst marketable monikers like Blue Dream, White Lotus, and Strawberry Kush. Some cannabis breeders are much less serious when it comes time to name their new genetic creation, and this list showcases the best of the worst – the dirtiest, the weirdest, the most NSFW strains in the history of cannabis.\n \n1. Wet Dream\n\nThere are a ton of strains out there that induce severe horniness in some individuals (trust us, we read enough detailed and personal strain reviews to know). But, as far as we know, this sativa strain didn’t get its name from a night of magical, sexy, THC-fueled dreams. Wet Dream is just a cleverly named genetic cross between parent strains Blue Dream and Ocean Beach Haze.\n \n2. MILF\n\nThe MILF strain was popularized by the Showtime series “Weeds” as the main character’s signature product, but it’s also a strain that exists in the real world. After hearing the way some growers talk about their “sexy ladies” in the garden, you might suspect that MILF was created by some dendrophiliac who gets off to marijuana plants nearing the end of their maturation cycle. Nope. It’s just a cheeky acronym for “Marijuana I’d Like to Flower.”\n \n3. Purple Monkey Balls\n\nThe history of Purple Monkey Balls is, for the most part, shrouded in mystery. But if we were to guess how its birth story went, it probably went something like:\n\"Once upon a time, there lived a dude that thought poop jokes and penis cartoons were the best thing ever. One day while tending his pot garden, the dude noticed his plants blooming with large, round, purple buds covered in wiry orange pistil hairs. ‘How testicular and primate-like these are,’ he noted with impeccable perception. ‘…Purple Monkey Balls. Yes. Who wouldn\u0027t smoke that?\u0027 And it was so.\"\n \n4. XXX OG\n\nWARNING: this strain contains somewhat hardcore levels of THC. Consumer discretion is advised. So yeah, this is a super potent indica strain that\u0027s said to have aphrodisiac qualities, but take in too much XXX OG and you’re more likely to find yourself uselessly slumped on the couch than in the bedroom making sexy times.\n \n5. Dirty Girl\n\nNot sure if people just expect arousal with a name like Dirty Girl, but there are enough horndog Leafly reviews to question the power of placebo. It’s easy to see Dirty Girl having a positive influence on the libido, though: the effects are energizing, functional, and just euphoric enough to turn a good night into a really, really, really ridiculously good night.\n \n6. Alaskan Thunder Fuck\n\nDespite having a name that would offend all those who keep a swear jar in their home, Alaskan Thunder Fuck remains a timeless classic that won’t be leaving the market any time soon. Some medical marijuana dispensaries abbreviate it to “ATF” on their menus to keep up appearances, but one might argue that this doesn’t provide fair warning of the thundering cerebral mindf*ck to come.\n \n7. Asian Fantasy\n\nYeah, there’s no exciting back story to Asian Fantasy. Her name\u0027s the only reason she\u0027s on this list.\n \nHave you come across any other cringe-tastic, dirty, or downright NSFW strains?

Worry not, there are plenty of other new varieties waiting!\n   1. Sensi Skunk\nCharacteristics of Sensi Skunk:\n\nSensi Skunk from Sensi Seeds is a potent Skunk #1 hybrid that offers a sweet and citrus flavor in contrast with the earthy, herbal aroma typical of Skunk varieties. The indica-driven effects produce a calm and euphoric buzz that relaxes tense muscles and alleviates stress. A great choice for indoor gardeners, Sensi Skunk boasts a short flowering cycle with heavy yields. Sensi Seeds has also released feminized and auto-flowering versions for those looking to streamline the cultivation process.\n\n   2. Dirty Girl\nCharacteristics of Dirty Girl:\n\nDirty Girl is a sativa-dominant cross of a Trainwreck hybrid, known as Arcata Lemon Wreck, and Cinderella 99. The combination produces a tropical aroma of pineapples, citrus, and fruit, with a sharp pungent note reminiscent of Pine Sol. The flavor of Dirty Girl is like sweet lemon candy and the effects it produces are happy and creative. Dirty Girl will elevate your mood and help avoid the complications of depression, anxiety, and migraines / headaches.\n\n   3. Game Changer\nCharacteristics of Game Changer:\n\nThe 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid Game Changer is a clone-only strain plausibly named for its ability to pivot bad moods, aches, and pains. It descends from California’s Purple Dragon and Thailand’s landrace sativa known as Green Thai, and this genetic fusion is evident in Game Changer’s twisting hues of vibrant green and deep purple. Floral notes sit quietly under a loud aroma of tropical fruit and grape in a show of this hybrid’s complex terpene profile. Whether it’s day or night, Game Changer offers unencumbered euphoria perfect for those looking to ease into the cannabis waters.\n\n   4. Blue Monster\nCharacteristics of Blue Monster:\n\nBlue Monster is a powerful combination of G13, Blueberry, Northern Lights #5, and a Mexican landrace strain. Bred by Goldenseed, Blue Monster combines a sweet mix of flavors with strong indica effects. Its complex aroma of berries and tropical fruits exposes the influence of Blueberry and G13 genetics. When grown to its full potential, the forceful relaxation of Blue Monster can overwhelm novices with its immediate body sedation and commanding cerebral effects. This monster indica is sure to scare away sleepless nights and body pains.\n\n   5. White Diesel\nCharacteristics of White Diesel:\n\nWhite Diesel is a sativa-dominant hybrid that mixes the resinous White Widow with the pungent flavors of NYC Diesel. The buds from White Diesel produce a zesty combination of lemon, grapefruit, and the diesel fumes that we’ve come to expect from Sour Diesel varieties. The effects are a well-rounded mix of an uplifting sativa head buzz with mellow body relaxation. Medical patients enjoy White Diesel’s ability to ward off anxiety and depression, and for combating migraines and gastrointestinal disorders.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002351/new-strains-alert-sensi-skunk-dirty-girl-game-changer-blue-monste.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-sensi-skunk-dirty-girl-game-changer-blue-monste"}],"reviewCount":156,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":24.964609499713863},{"name":"Pine","score":22.044516731423752},{"name":"Lemon","score":13.1253576699497},{"name":"Flowery","score":11.185657058522334},{"name":"Earthy","score":10.57422969187675}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":78.467516038673523},{"name":"Energetic","score":59.01177675371224},{"name":"Uplifted","score":50.729646697388631},{"name":"Euphoric","score":46.033252010481604},{"name":"Relaxed","score":42.174934489925}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":45.685370922562569},{"name":"Depression","score":39.0327098581368},{"name":"Pain","score":31.252823710129213},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":15.592903828197946},{"name":"Fatigue","score":15.555254359808439}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":21.068642510767745},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":7.2686063672780934},{"name":"PTSD","score":5.0231920725279355},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.2061986084756482},{"name":"PMS","score":3.879401222854733}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":21.759886750399083},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":8.4500466853408032},{"name":"Dizzy","score":7.95985060690943},{"name":"Headache","score":7.4696545284780571},{"name":"Paranoid","score":3.0834914611005688}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_6839.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/670092/b/dirty-girl__primary_3d22.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_dda6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/525393/b/dirty-girl__primary_e2c1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_1106.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/510319/b/dirty-girl__primary_258f.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_c6ab.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/501483/b/dirty-girl__primary_8a0e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_613f.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/464579/b/dirty-girl__primary_83c1.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/dirty-girl_100x100_813e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/462886/b/dirty-girl__primary_0924.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":16,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Spokane, WA","Everett, WA","Lynnwood, WA","Mount Vernon, WA","Shoreline, WA","Bellingham, WA","Bremerton, WA","Spokane Valley, WA","Bothell, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.51282051282051/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Cinderella 99","subtitle":null,"slug":"cinderella-99","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderella-99","symbol":"C99","applink":"leafly://strain/cinderella-99"},{"name":"Trainwreck","subtitle":null,"slug":"trainwreck","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck","symbol":"Tw","applink":"leafly://strain/trainwreck"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
