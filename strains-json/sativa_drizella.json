Let me count the ways. The wonderful taste of Drizella is something to be experienced, hints of pineapple, vanilla, and notes of lavender (?) make it a tasty treat. The true love comes from the effect! Instant happy, energy with a lovely mellow drift into sleep. This isn\u0027t the Purple Afghani assault but more of a subtle lullaby. I was able to start creative projects with ease and coupled with The Flav helped chill out some serious MS blues.  MS\u0027ers who need something to help pick them up, when life, people or circumstances have you at the end of your rope - look for the Drizella.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/5DsWrIpoq-56NpD59UXAqpoVN88=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fqSLuo6zNRCeIia1paBYS_wayfarers-purple.png"},{"id":1288392,"username":"jascomp","text":"Buds were light and fluffy.
