            "text": "This is the second straight-up Sativa that I've smoked. It burns like a 5-alarm fire in the back of your throat. Harsh as hell, but that harshness just reminds you that you can't reach weed-Valhalla without experiencing a bit of pain. Very fast-acting stuff. Unlike Strawberry Cough, another Sativa I have tried, this one gives you a head high and a full body high. I have severe chronic lower back pain from two herniated discs, I felt no pain. I was floating, happy, content, not overly hungry and I slept like a stone all night long. (I am one of those people with insomnia.) Excellent strain but not for the faint-hearted. The burn when this stuff goes in will remind you that pleasure always comes with a certain degree of pain.",

            "text": "Light doses through my vapourizer at low heat setting results in an extremely clean high. Totally functional, energetic, happy, euphoric - without any of the downsides such as red eyes, munchies, cotton mouth, anxiety, etc. I can only give this 4 stars because I do find it to be a bit on the harsh side regarding throat feel. I rarely cough when using my vapourizer, especially way down at 190 celcius, but this one caught me off guard.\n\nUpdate: I had one too many large pulls off my vaporizer the other day and about 15 minutes later I had full blown anxiety/panic issues with a big dose of self-hatred/loathing. Be careful with the Dragon, folks. It only lasted about 30 minutes but it was very unpleasant. Respect.",
