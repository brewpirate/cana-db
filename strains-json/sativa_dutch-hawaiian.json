It is just so tasty its unbelievable citrusy doesn't even start to describe the smell and the flavor the is so pungent and sticks all the way through even the ash is tasty, your hands will smell like most the AMAZING dank, you will constantly smell the bowl after you take a toke, you will crave the flavor and want to load more just for the taste. To top it all off, the high is very euphoric and energetic.. everything you could ever ask for in a strain..",
