Definitely has strong diesel aroma, light green coated in gorgeous white trichromes with some orange hairs. Good for staying productive, you can still function.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/kJc1LyLawlfeJ9xGeaJMdVhCp9U=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fmstpXGgRuu3rPFHmtQHb_aviator-green.png"},{"id":1627301,"username":"deftonesdexy","text":"Great for daytime use. Keeps you calm and euphoric yet active and moving. This is great for my yoga sessions when I want to remain focused and intuned with my poses and breathing. Also great for working those long shifts at work. Keeps you uplifted and stress free and very in the moment.
