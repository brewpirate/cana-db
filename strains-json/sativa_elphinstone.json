The taste on the palate is floral and candy-like, and the taste lasts far into the bowl versus some strains that lose their taste after 3-4 hits. Stoney for a sativa, but helped me do laundry and clean the kitchen without that UGH feeling. All in all from the wonderful aroma and smooth smoke and focused Stoney high, I will be buying this again. ",
