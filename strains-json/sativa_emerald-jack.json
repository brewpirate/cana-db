Some weed makes you take off your pants. Some weed puts you right in a trance. Then there\u0027s this stuff. I hate to speak ill of greenbud, especially stuff that 20 years ago would have knocked my socks off, but compared to the other strains I\u0027ve tried, this is just \"meh\". The high is heavy-headed, full-body and no-energy; if this is what you\u0027re after then be of good cheer, because the high lasts a good couple of hours. The downside is that you\u0027ll also feel like you just stepped off the Spin\u0027n\u0027Puke at the county fair. The dizziness wasn\u0027t quite THAT bad, but the feeling of sidewaysness constantly intruded into the high, kinda like when your mom would knock on your door when you were trying to watch skeezy anime. That said, Emerald Jack is only $10 a gram, so if you DO want to feel numb and dizzy, you can either spin around and around and around in an office chair, then fall on your head or just cough up the 10 bucks at your local pot shop.
