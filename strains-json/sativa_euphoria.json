            "text": "Last night, the Boston Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals in a 4-2 series to clinch their eighth World Series title in franchise history. For those of you cannabis consumers who are also fans of The Sawx (or for BoSox fans who are also cannabis consumers \u2014 after all, you did have a player on your team named Smoky Joe Wood), what better way to celebrate your beloved team's third World Series win in 10 seasons than with the following strains:\n1. Cherry Pie\n\nThey say baseball is as American as apple pie, but in honor of Boston's red-hued winners, we think you should opt for cherry this go around.\u00a0\n2. East Coast Sour Diesel\n\nNot only do the Sox rule the east coast, they reign supreme over the entire nation.\n3. Dynamite\n\nTo celebrate a dynamite season, of course.\n4. Lifesaver\n\nKnowing how die-hard Boston sports fans are, the Sox's win may very well have lifted their spirits out of some hard times.\u00a0\n5. Jillybean\n\nFor Beantown, duh.\n6. Euphoria\n\nRide that wave straight to the victory parade!\n7. Red Haze\n\nI'm guessing this is the current state of the entire city of Boston.\u00a0\n8. King Kush\n\nThis one's in honor of the \"King of October,\" David Ortiz, who was awarded MVP.\u00a0\u00a0\n9. Holy Grail Kush\n\nWhat bigger Holy Grail exists in baseball other than a World Series win?\u00a0\nAnd, of course:\u00a0\n10. F*cking Incredible\n\nCongratulations, Red Sox! And congrats to the city of Boston. As a native Michigander, I will continue to weep over the Tigers' continued inability to execute in the playoffs.\u00a0\nphoto credits: nancydowd,\u00a0Werner Kunz,\u00a0kim.rossi,\u00a0Werner Kunz,\u00a0Aero Racer E,\u00a0bunkosquad,\u00a0sea turtle,\u00a0ctsilva,\u00a0joyosity,\u00a0B Rosen via photopin cc",

    "description": "<p>Euforia (or&nbsp;Euphoria) was bred from Skunk strains in the early 2000s by Amsterdam&rsquo;s Dutch Passion seed company. Once out, this strain began to collect awards including 2nd Place in the sativa category at the 2000 <em>High Times </em>Cannabis Cup and a Best Seeds HighLife Cup in 2002. These plant requires minimal fuss when growing and can even produce a bumper crop for the savvy grower after her initial flowering at 9 weeks. Euforia may have Skunk parents, but the aroma is sweeter and more floral than skunky. Effects of this strain are upbeat and social overall, so much so that it might be too energetic for some users, especially if sleep is the goal. Great for social anxiety, this strain performs just as expected and promotes a sense of well-being.</p>\n",

Tends to last longer than most I've tried.  Anxiety level is way lower and I can actually have a conversation without getting stuck. As for pain...it does help.  Taking a piece of medicinal chocolate heightens the body high to relax more and no pain for at least 5 hours.  Using a vaporizer is way better.  The taste is unspeakable...like a starburst in your mouth.  ",
