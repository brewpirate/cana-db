            "text": "Who doesn\u2019t love a good Netflix and chill sesh? Now that the days are getting shorter, the weather a little colder, and the sweatpants a little cozier, we thought we\u2019d peruse the list of new releases coming to Netflix in November to recommend a few options that would pair well with these delectable strains. If you find yourself interested in any of these streaming offerings, try to pick up the corresponding strains to enhance your Netflix and chill experience.\n\u00a0\nCOMEDIES\nMaster of None: Season 1\n\nDate Available: November 6\nThis new comedy series stars Aziz Ansari, who you may recognize as Tom Haverford from \u201cParks and Recreation.\u201d His new show follows the personal and professional life of a 30-year old actor in New York City.\nStrain Pairing: Black Domina\n\nIn homage to Ansari\u2019s Tom Haverford character and his food language, we thought a nice appetite-inducing strain like Black Domina would pair well with his new comedy series. Order up some chicky chicky parm parm and some big ol\u2019 cookies \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want to laugh on an empty stomach!\n\u00a0\nW/Bob & David\n\nDate Available: November 13\nThese two veteran comedians are back with another round of sketch comedy. The pair became notable for their first sketch series, Mr. Show with Bob and David, and each has enjoyed acclaim in separate television series (David Cross for \u201cArrested Development\u201d and Bob Odenkirk for \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d). So pull up a chair (just ask if you can use it first) and get ready for some good laughs!\nStrain Pairing: Fire Haze\n\nThis daytime sativa will help get the giggles going for a marathon sesh of sketch comedy, and its happy, uplifting effects will ensure that you won\u2019t lose steam while you binge-watch.\n\u00a0\nDOCUMENTARIES\nLast Days in Vietnam\n\nDate Available: November 1\nThis Oscar-nominated documentary explores the chaotic final weeks of the Vietnam War, when American soldiers and diplomats were faced with the tough decision to obey White House orders to evacuate only U.S. citizens, or whether they were willing to risk treason charges in order to save South Vietnamese citizens as well.\nStrain Pairing: Dream Queen\n\nThe hybrid strain Dream Queen should help balance the sobering effects of this wartime documentary by delivering uplifting relaxation while still allowing you to focus on the film.\n\u00a0\nSoaked in Bleach\n\nDate Available: November 15\nYes, it\u2019s another Kurt Cobain documentary. You may have heard of the film \u201cKurt Cobain: Montage of Heck\u201d that\u2019s been generating attention lately, but \u201cSoaked in Bleach\u201d follows a private investigator who had been hired by Courtney Love and his perspective on the death of the grunge legend.\nStrain Pairing: Chemdawg\n\nThe creative Chemdawg should help you tap into your inner artist as you revisit the life of one of the 90s\u2019 most iconic musicians.\n\u00a0\nFOR THE KID IN ALL OF US\nThe SpongeBob Squarepants Movie\n\nDate Available: November 1\nSometimes a \u201cNetflix and chill\u201d night is best spent watching a silly children\u2019s film, and SpongeBob Squarepants can deliver just that. Follow your favorite pineapple under the sea-dwelling creature and his pal Patrick as they attempt to track down King Neptune\u2019s stolen crown.\n[BLURB]\nStrain Pairing: Pineapple Express\n\nNothing should put a smile on your face like a silly animated feature paired with the grin-inducing Pineapple Express. You\u2019ll feel energetic and uplifted, plus the pineapple flavor is an all-too appropriate combination for Spongebob\u2019s humble abode.\n\u00a0\nSCI-FI/ACTION\nRobot Overlords\n\nDate Available: November 1\nOh no! Earth has been overtaken by alien robots, and it\u2019s up to Gillian Anderson and Ben Kingsley to save the day! If you\u2019re in the mood for a so-bad-it-might-be-good robot sci-fi film starring Gandhi and Scully, this ridiculous action/adventure offering could be right up your alley.\nStrain Pairing: Chocolope\n\nThis optimistic sativa will keep you happy long after the movie does, keeping you alert and energetic while you slog through what will either be a \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d or a \u201cnever again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMarvel\u2019s Jessica Jones: Season 1\n\nDate Available: November 20\nA superhero (the titular Jessica Jones) goes the private investigator route in this new Netflix original series based on the Marvel graphic novels. Starring a who\u2019s who of recognizable actors, including Krysten Ritter (who you may recognize from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d), David Tennant (\u201cDr. Who\u201d fans should know him all too well), and Carrie-Anne Moss (aka Trinity from \u201cThe Matrix\u201d trilogy), this show could be a fun entry into the ever-expanding Marvel universe.\nStrain Pairing: Bruce Banner\n\nWhat better pairing for a Marvel television series than this comic book character-inspired strain? The powerful Bruce Banner will settle you into a euphoric and creative state of mind, perfect for getting absorbed into the vast world of Marvel.\n\u00a0\nWILDCARD SELECTION\nThe Runner\n\nDate Available: November 5\nOh, Nicolas Cage. He\u2019s an actor so enigmatic that it\u2019s tough to decide whether he\u2019s good or bad. In \u201cThe Runner,\u201d he plays a sex scandal-plagued politician during the 2010 BP oil spill. Is this a \u201cgood\u201d Nic Cage flick or a \u201cbad\u201d one? Grab a strain and decide for yourself!\nStrain Pairing: LA Confidential\n\nThis potent indica has strong psychedelic effects, putting you in the perfect state of mind to fully embrace the Nic Cage experience. Whether your mind is blown or bored by this movie, you\u2019ll feel calm and relaxed enough to easily drift off to sleep afterwards.\nImage sources: IMDb",
