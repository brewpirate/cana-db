            "text": "Unfortunately this Leafly review is incorrect. The Frostbite strain was created in Phoenix in 2012 after medical marijuana initiatives were passed In AZ. It is a cross of TGA subcool deep purple  combined with a pure Afghan Kush indica. It has a slightly purple color but mostly appears white because of the heavy coating of trichomes. This strain has a strong fruity and skunky smell similar to Grand Daddy purple(GDP) with a slightly earthy tone. I know because I was the one who created this strain and after months of research and no frostbite strain on the record that was the name I settled with. Don't be fooled by knock offs!",

Also a great mood enhancer. \n\nEffects last hours while it gives you an overall sense of peace.  \nYou will feel the buzz instantly while any negative energy is carried away and you're left with a big smile and a refreshed outlook on life.\n\nI tend to get angry more often then I'd like, I can't help it though people just can be so aggravating. It's been 2 weeks I have been relaxed and haven't flipped out on as many people.\n\nI have been so stressed trying to move and this helps me deal with it.\n\nThanks to frostbite.",
