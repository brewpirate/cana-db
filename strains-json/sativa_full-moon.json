            "text": "New varieties in the Leafly Explorer await you! For the lovers out there looking for an herbal aphrodisiac, allow us to suggest the ridiculously named Purple Panty Dropper. Or, for the refined palates looking for something more tasteful, let us point you toward the Sour Banana Sherbet or Blackberry Cream. If you've already tried one or more of these strains, be sure to leave a review and let the rest of us know what the experience was like!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a01. Purple Panty Dropper\n\nA three-way cross of Purple Haze, Oregon Grape, and Matanuskan Mist, Humboldt Seed Company\u2019s Purple Panty Dropper is named for its deep purple hues and supposed aphrodisiac effects. These beautiful indica-dominant flowers produce a rich, sweet aroma and an energizing, euphoric high.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a02. Full Moon\n\nNirvana Seeds found this beauty on the Thai island of Koh Phangan and named it after the famous Full Moon Party held monthly on Haad Rin beach. A classic tropical sativa, Full Moon is a tall, stretchy, long-flowering strain that will produce dense buds under HID lighting. Sweet-smelling with a spicy smoke typical of most Thai varieties, users can expect a trippy, visually stimulating high that can be uncomfortable to those unfamiliar with strong sativas.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a03. Sour Banana Sherbet\n\nThis powerful hybrid from Crockett Family Farms is the result of crossing AJ\u2019s Sour Diesel with Banana Sherbet. A THC content between 18% and 24% means Sour Banana Sherbet is a heavy hitter, and it reportedly makes excellent concentrates. The terpene profile is a mix of sour fruit and diesel fuel flavors. While it is very easy to grow, it will stretch a great deal, so height management techniques must be employed when growing indoors.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a04. Blackberry Cream\n\nBlackberry Cream from Exotic Genetix combines the sweet berry terpenes of Blackberry Kush with the smooth creamy notes of Cookies and Cream. This 70% indica hybrid produces THC levels up to 25%, above average yields, and is an excellent choice for hash making.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a05. Panama Punch\n\nBerry, apple, grape, mango, pineapple; if you love fruity flavors and terpenes, Panama Punch is the strain for you! A sativa-dominant hybrid, this cross of Panama Mean Green and Neville\u2019s Haze possesses many of the characteristics associated with strong sativas: longer flowering times, high THC levels, and an intense, psychedelic buzz. In addition to the heavy fruit smells, Panama Punch has a spicy, Haze-like flavor when vaped or smoked.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a06. Highwayman\n\nHighwayman is a cross of William\u2019s Wonder and Tang Tang created by Colorado breeder Tierra Rojo and supposedly named in honor of Willie Nelson and the rest of the famed outlaw country supergroup, the Highwaymen. An even mix of sativa and indica genetics, it produces an uplifting, creative head high along with a subtle body buzz and aromas of chocolate and coffee. This strain can be beneficial in treating pain, anxiety, and depression.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a07. The OX\n\nRare Dankness created their own version of Bubba Kush by crossing it with their Stone Mountain, a Bubba Kush and Blue Moonshine hybrid. The OX has a delightful flavor of coffee and berries, and a high CBD content, making it a good choice for medical users. Many indica hybrids have been created using The OX, including Chem OX, Blue OX, and Harlox.\n\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",
