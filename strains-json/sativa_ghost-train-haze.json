I\u0027m thinking that I have a new favorite Sativa strain to pass on to you and my close friends.  I say \"close\" friends because I\u0027m stashing some of it for the \"special\" times when I want to smoke  a very strong Sativa that will pull off the \"Stun-Gun\" effect on my head while I sit there and think deep thoughts.\nIt will leave you with the look of a child who just saw Santa Claus, or perhaps you\u0027ll look like the Village Idiot...all depends on the individual and his psyche at time of consumption.\nThe buds are super-dense for a Sativa, and in this crop, the flowers are circular in shape, approx. 1\"-3\" in diameter, with a light green color with a dusty coating that will set off sparks when fire is applied.  Nice, like the 4th of July!\nIf you get an opportunity to try Ghost Train Haze, don\u0027t pass it up.  Strong, eyeball popping Sativa varieties are hard to come by...Ghost Train Haze fits that bill very nicely.  5 Stars for the Ghost Train Haze!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1643033,"username":"bigtear@live.com","text":"Got a half ounce at the end of may..I am not very impressed by the popcorn buds, each and every 1 of em. \nNot hard buds, just soft airy popcorn buds which wasnt posted in the description on the page.

The intricacies of its aroma may fall apart under the heat of combustion. An imperfect cure, flush, or growing environment can also lead to a harsher smoke. But a well-grown flower with amazing flavor is something to truly revel in.\nThese Washington state strains exhibit flavors that can stand the test of heat, delivering well-preserved terpene profiles when smoked or vaporized. Whether you like sour strains that reek of diesel or sweet varieties that taste just like fruit medley, dig in and find the one for you.\n\nSherbet by Gabriel Cannabis\n\nVoted “Best Flavor” in this season’s Top THC-Dominant Strains in Washington, Sherbet by Gabriel Cannabis embodies a harmony of sweet-smelling terpenes. Its aroma is sugary and dessert-like but opens up into flavors of deep grape and marionberry. The exhale leaves behind an earthy, herbal taste much like spicy echinacea tea.\nFind Sherbet Nearby\nGhost Train Haze by Sweet As!\n\nGhost Train Haze is known to pack a spice rack of different flavors, which Sweet As! captures masterfully in its own rendition. Upon opening the container, your nose is immediately met with an overpowering aroma of overripe oranges, sour citrus, and pine oil cleaner. Its flavor shape-shifts into what feels like an entirely new palate of tastes, including clean mint, lavender, and rich sandalwood.\nFind Ghost Train Haze Nearby\n\nMiddlefork by Royal Tree Gardens\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the first place winner of this season’s Top THC-Dominant Strains in Washington delivered a standout experience of flavor. Royal Tree’s Middlefork carries an overwhelming diversity of fruity, dessert-like flavors that can range from lemon-blueberry muffins to vanilla chai, citrus tea, or candied oranges with a slightly sour fizz. The smooth exhale leaves these flavors lingering a moment before its dreamy, euphoric effects take the wheel.\nFind Middlefork Nearby\nChocolope by Gabriel Cannabis\n\nTraditionally, Chocolope is an earthy strain with subtle flavors of spice and coffee. Gabriel’s Chocolope, however, delivers an altogether different experience—one that is nuanced with bright flavors of lime, tropical fruit, and warm pine dancing together on the exhale. Its flavor is an undisturbed reflection of its aroma, which bursts from the jar with loud notes of sour candied citrus.\nFind Chocolope Nearby\nSour Diesel by Nebula Gardens\n\nSour Diesel has long been a household name, known by its sting of sour fuel and acrid gas. Nebula’s hand at Sour Diesel is impressive in both aroma and flavor, preserving these legacy attributes with an earthy, minty finish. Hints of rosemary and spearmint are detectable in a vaporizer, whereas smoking this strain brings more of a sweet, hashy taste like burnt sage.\nFind Sour Diesel Nearby","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/14154638/sweet-as-ghost-train-haze-macro_web.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/washingtons-best-flavored-strains-from-fall-2017"},{"id":"contentitems-42408","title":"What Are You Smoking?
