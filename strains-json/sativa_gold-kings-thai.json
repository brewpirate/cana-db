At first it feels like a typical high, it\u0027s a bit of a creeper because 10-15 minutes into it I felt the intense cerebral head buzz ALONG with an unexpected relaxation of my body. Not couchlocking, but an intense body high as well. Being a new cultivator here I was hesitant after I tried a previous strain and found it mediocre. I only purchased this as it came in a bundle with a BG Sativa(this), a Hybrid(Purple Haze) and BG Oracle for an Indica. The Sativa and Indica are wonderful! I will definitely be trying more of their products.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1379912,"username":"hawkski86","text":"not much of a sativa man but this full blown sativa was really good for a morning wake and bake without the sleepiness. this strain has a nice strong pungent taste with a hint of something I cannot place.
