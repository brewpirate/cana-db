This <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/the-cannabis-origin-what-is-a-landrace-strain\">heirloom lineage</a> is a special and rare cut that grows tight, colorful buds contrary to the traditional lanky stocks of Southeast Asia. During maturation, the plant&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-are-trichomes-on-cannabis\">trichome</a> dusted foliage transitions to a light amber/gold, contrasting against the purple and red hues of its leaves.

            "text": "I am lucky enough to live in the Midwest where Bedford Grows managed to get their hands on these seeds and euphoria was born. At first it feels like a typical high, it's a bit of a creeper because 10-15 minutes into it I felt the intense cerebral head buzz ALONG with an unexpected relaxation of my body. Not couchlocking, but an intense body high as well. Being a new cultivator here I was hesitant after I tried a previous strain and found it mediocre. I only purchased this as it came in a bundle with a BG Sativa(this), a Hybrid(Purple Haze) and BG Oracle for an Indica. The Sativa and Indica are wonderful! I will definitely be trying more of their products.",

I wanted to say Woody for a second. clean head high with a burst of small energy but after a few minutes I started waking up high.",
