            "text": "Picked this up at Fweedom in Mountlake Terrace, Wa\n*brand is Liberty Reach which says its a hybrid with 24% thc.\n\nVaporized in a Da Buddha \n\nLow odor, nice pleasant taste, not overly citrus, smells a bit like oranges when you open the jar. I had never been a big fan of tangje before but the mix of the golden calyx is really nice.\n\nVery relaxing, cut through any stress I had in my head. Smooth onset of relaxation, focus and uplifting mood.\n\nWould be great for gaming, binge watching, or physical activity due to focus.  Would recommend for beginners as well as experienced folks. ",
