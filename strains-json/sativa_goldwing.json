            "text": "Goldwing is an absolutely beautiful sativa. The eighth I purchased from SPARC was rated at 16% THC and .29% CBD, and has been too delightful for words, every time. It is probably the most impressive sativa I've smoked: it gives me a feeling of pure, lucid euphoria; no pot I've used has been so specifically emotionally uplifting before.\r\n\r\nThe second time I smoked some, I was seized with a sense that everything in my life was perfectly fine, that I'd no cause (and had never had cause) for worry. It was lovely, and in a way it was accurate.\r\n\r\nIn other words: it's a sativa that is clear and gorgeous and makes you feel great. Recommended!",

            "text": "The effect from Goldwing is very nice indeed, but what really makes it stand out to me is its wonderful taste and aroma. I got some maybe 3 or 4 times from \u201cPeace in Medicine\u201d in Sebastopol, Ca. and every time it was not only very tasty, but also had long lasting flavor\u2026 The bowl would look/be just about dusted before it lost its fresh/green taste. Of course that could have more to do with how it was grown than the strain, but then I guess that\u2019s the whole idea behind this rating system (to get a general consensus about the various strains).",
