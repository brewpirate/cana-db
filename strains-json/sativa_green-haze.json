            "text": "We\u2019re big fans of Game of Thrones here at Leafly and the crew is super stoked for the season 4 debut this Sunday on HBO. If you\u2019re planning on hosting a viewing party to kick off the premiere of one of the best shows on television, why not pick up some of these Game of Thrones-themed strains to properly celebrate?\nHere are 24 strains (some standing solo, some paired together) we feel tie in with the Game of Thrones universe perfectly (spoilers below if you aren\u2019t caught up to season 4 by now). Yes, 24. That\u2019s how much we love both our strains and this show. Even though All Men Must Die, their memories will live on thanks to this list of green.\n1. Mad Dawg \n\nThis earthy hybrid is in honor of Mad King Aerys II Targaryen, the kooky ruler who started this whole mess in the first place. Dude, all you had to do was not murder a bunch of people and threaten to burn down King\u2019s Landing and we wouldn\u2019t even have a Game of Thrones battle royale waging. If only he had a little stash of Mad Dawg to keep him feeling euphoric and relaxed.\n2. 3 Kings\n\nThe hybrid 3 Kings strain may be a fusion of Headband, Sour Diesel, and OG Kush, but it also signifies the three kings currently left standing in Game of Thrones at the start of season 4: Joffrey Lannister (aka The Worst Person Ever), Stannis Baratheon (aka \u201cStannis the Mannis,\u201d self-proclaimed King of the Andals), and Balon Greyjoy (aka World\u2019s Not-Greatest Dad), king of the Iron Islands. Maybe this pungent strain will clear some of the crazy out of their sinuses.\n3. Permafrost\n\nBecause, as House Stark constantly reminds us, \u201cWinter is coming,\u201d so you might as well hunker down and wait for it to arrive with some piney Permafrost.\nSpeaking of House Stark\u2026\n4. Northern Lights\n\nThe North remembers, and though their numbers are dwindling and the Starks are constantly having George R. R. Martin take a never-ending dump on them, there are still a few scrappy surviving members who have a glimmer of hope shining, however dimly at the moment. Northern Lights is good for combating stress, and I\u2019m guessing the Starks are feeling a little overwhelmed right about now.\n5. Lions Gate\n\nThis royal purple indica is in honor of the proud and wealthy Lannisters, who happen to use a lion as their sigil. The Lannisters appear to be sitting pretty right now \u2013 they rule the Seven Kingdoms, Jamie\u2019s been returned (mostly intact), Tywin\u2019s only been moderately cranky \u2013 but we\u2019ll see if their good luck streak will continue in season 4. They\u2019ll need the focus that the Lions Gate strain brings.\n6. Richie Rich + Power Kush \n\nSpeaking of Tywin Lannister, if you combine the hybrid Richie Rich with the indica Power Kush, you\u2019ll have a father who loves to play the game more than he loves his own family. I bet he\u2019s sneering in every family portrait that\u2019s been commissioned \u2013 it\u2019s the ye olde equivalent of blinking in photos.\n7. Killer Queen + Sour Power \n\nSticking with the Lannisters, let\u2019s shift gears to Cersei, former queen of Westeros and current queen of the \u201cWho farted?\u201d face. A Killer Queen willing to do whatever it takes to get as close to the Iron Throne as possible, this icy blonde beauty has felt her power go a little sour once she realized that her turd of a son can\u2019t be controlled. Talk about a disappointed parent. She really takes after her father, doesn\u2019t she?\n8. Little Devil + Abusive OG\n\nUgh, Joffrey is the worst. We can\u2019t think of a better pairing for the little pissant than the hybrid Little Devil and the indica Abusive OG. If ever King Joffrey\u2019s horrible ways feel a little too heavy for your tastes, just remember that he got b-slapped by the best character ever:\n\nSpeaking of which\u2026\n9. Royal Dwarf \n\nTyrion Lannister is rumored to be one of the characters George R. R. Martin\u2019s wife made him promise he would never kill off. I think every Game of Thrones fan can agree \u2013 even though he\u2019s a Lannister, he\u2019s still a Royal Dwarf and one of the best characters on the show.\nAnother favorite character?\n10. Jane Doe + Odyssey \n\nFierce little Arya Stark has seen many of her family members fall victim to the Game of Thrones and now she\u2019s out for blood. This pint-sized warrior in the making has abandoned her identity and gone all Jane Doe in an attempt to take out the people on her shit list. How will her revenge Odyssey pan out?\n11. Critical Mass\n\nSticking with the Starks, we\u2019ve never had a drastic shift in character sympathy than for poor Sansa. Sure, she was a naive, stuck-up teenager in season 1, but she\u2019s had most of her family murdered, been held prisoner, and was nearly forced to marry a psychopath Lannister before being forced to marry another Lannister. Tyrion\u2019s been kind to her so far but honestly, how much more suffering do you have in store for Sansa, George R. R. Martin? She seems to be at Critical Mass right now and could use a little of the happy effects this indica brings.\nKnow who else is feeling a little blue?\n12. Blue Bastard \n\nOh, Jon Snow. The bastard son of Ned Stark has been on his own Odyssey but he can\u2019t seem to make up his mind as to what he wants (maybe he really does know \u201cnuthing\u201d). Is it revenge for the Starks? Does he want to protect the Night\u2019s Watch or defect from them? Or maybe he wants to catch a glimpse of another Ogre with Ygritte (although \u201cJon Snuhhhh\u201d isn\u2019t exactly in her good graces right now). It\u2019s been a depressing journey for him thus far \u2013 good thing Blue Bastard is good for relieving depression.\n13. White Zombie + Snow Monster\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen a few of the horrors that lie north of the Wall, including a White Zombie who looked like a frigid Iggy Pop. Can Jon Snow protect the Seven Kingdoms from the Snow Monsters that are advancing?\n14. Super Sour Widow\u00a0\n\nPoor Catelyn Stark. Even though she could never love the bastard Jon Snow, she still didn\u2019t deserve to have her entire family either murdered or scattered across the Seven Kingdoms. Talk about a Super Sour Widow.\nAnd to make matters worse\u2026\n15. Red Haze \n\nThat Red Wedding was effed up, yo. Like seriously. After watching that episode, you probably felt as amped up as the effects the sativa Red Haze can bring (and you were likely in a Red Haze of your own once \u201cThe Rains of Castamere\u201d started playing).\n16. Blackwater + Green Haze\n\nAnother iconic moment in Game of Thrones, this event was less heart-breaking than the Red Wedding and more awe-inspiring. The Battle of the Blackwater has been the biggest battle in the War of the Five Kings so far. Tyrion\u2019s use of wildfire put Stannis\u2019 army in a Green Haze and protected King\u2019s Landing from being overrun. By combining the indica Blackwater and the sativa Green Haze, you\u2019re creating quite the explosive hybrid strain yourself.\n17. Cherry Bomb\n\nCherry Bomb continue to deliver (both literally and figuratively), or will her influence over him go up in flames?\n\u00a0\n18. Anesthesia\n\nA little something both Jaime Lannister and Theon Greyjoy could have used throughout season 3, amirite guys? The indica Anesthesia is widely used for pain management, making it an appropriate option for these two whipping boys.\n19. Lifesaver\n\nJaime owes you one, Brienne of Tarth. Why not have him pick up this euphoric hybrid Lifesaver strain while you two bathe and reminisce about the time you both faced off against a friggin\u2019 grizzly bear?\n20. Brains Damage\n\nWhat better way to celebrate the possibly brain-damaged but entertainingly verbose Hodor with this Hodor, I mean hybrid strain that brings sleepiness, Hodor, and Hodor Hodor.\n21. Bordello\n\nAny Game of Thrones viewer is all-too familiar with the show\u2019s numerous \u201csexposition\u201d scenes that occur in a brothel or during sex scenes to spruce up an otherwise boring plot advancement. Take a taste of the hybrid Bordello whenever a sexposition scene pops up and you\u2019ll feel so relaxed, you\u2019ll forget how shamelessly (and entertainingly) gratuitous these parts actually are.\n22. True OG \n\nWho will end up winning the Game of Thrones? Who do you feel is the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? Partake in this relaxing indica while you ponder who you feel the \u201cTrue OG\u201d should be.\nWill it be\u2026\n23. Dream Queen + Triple Diesel\n\nMany Game of Thrones fans are rooting for their \u201cDream Queen,\u201d Daenerys Targaryen, who\u2019s using her Triple Diesel dragons to kick ass, free slaves, and chew bubblegum (and she\u2019s all out of bubblegum).\nAnd finally\u2026\n24. F*cking Incredible\n\nWhich is exactly what this show is. Happy watching!\nImage credits: mad king, House Lannister",
