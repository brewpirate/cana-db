The unusual taste does indeed have a bit of melon about it , which is apparently what a cantaloupe is so that explains that ... i dont think this is very high on the old thc as its a nice light uplifting creative strain so cbd is very high and the build up of tolerance is a good week at least :) beautiful strain",
