            "text": "Cannabidiol, or CBD, is becoming a mainstay in consumers\u2019 medicine cabinets as it combats pain, inflammation, anxiety, and much more. However, even as CBD strains and products become more readily available, the price tag can often make one flinch. For this reason, it\u2019s worth knowing which products will bring the best value based on CBD abundance.\n\nLooking at data from cannabis testing labs across Washington State, we compiled a list of strains that tend to produce significant amount of CBD. These numbers are derived from the testing samples of cannabis flowers and do not include CBD concentrates.\nClick to enlarge. (Elysse Feigenblatt/Leafly)\nIn the above graph, you\u2019ll find the average cannabinoid contents of ten popular CBD-dominant strains. You\u2019ll notice that many of these strains contain only trace amounts of THC, while others exhibit a more balanced CBD:THC ratio (which means they will be more euphoric in effect). This graph is based on datasets from multiple reliable testing labs across Washington State. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the datasets from each individual lab differ slightly.\nTake a look at the cannabinoid data from one lab, and notice how the numbers shift slightly.\nClick to enlarge. (Elysse Feigenblatt/Leafly)\nMost strains maintain a CBD:THC ratio similar to that in the averaged dataset. However, you\u2019ll also see deviations, like ACDC which exhibits a more balanced CBD:THC ratio according to this lab\u2019s individual testing results.\nNow let\u2019s see how the dataset of Lab A compares to a different lab, also represented in the larger, averaged dataset above.\nClick to enlarge. (Elysse Feigenblatt/Leafly)\nAs you can see, the CBD levels from Lab B are much higher on average than those from Lab A. There are a number of possible explanations for this. A lab may manufacture bloated cannabinoid profiles, as we\u2019ve seen some labs do in the past. It could also be that Lab B simply tested samples from growers who achieved higher CBD levels in their harvest.\nThe main takeaway here is this: the cannabinoid profile printed on your product depends not only on the strain\u2019s genetics and expertise of the grower, but also on the testing methods (and ethics) of the local lab that performed the chemical analysis. The Dancehall you bought on your last trip to the dispensary is likely to reflect the cannabinoid data illustrated in the above graphs\u2013however, if you see deviation, the reason lies in the many layers of strain and data variability.\n\nCannabis Strains With High Levels of CBD\nWith this caveat in mind, let\u2019s look at the strains that expressed the highest levels of CBD according to the above lab data.\n\nFind Dancehall Nearby\nDancehall is an upbeat and inspiring strain meant to lift your spirits while coercing creativity. With a CBD:THC ratio of nearly 20:1 on average, this strain delivers little to no euphoric effects that might distract focus or dampen cognition in THC-sensitive consumers.\n\nFind ACDC Nearby\nKnown for its keen ability to lift anxiety of all shades, ACDC is a godsend to consumers susceptible to the side effects of THC. This strain allows you to harness many of the desirable traits of cannabis, like light-footed physical relaxation and gentle mood elevation, without the cost of a clear, calm mind.\n\nFind Suzy Q Nearby\nSuzy Q is a CBD-dominant strain with an extremely modest amount of THC, making it another mellow strain with little to no high. The mild effects of this pine-scented strain help you shed anxious or demotivating mental blocks that stood in the way of creativity and productivity.\n\nFind Ringo\u2019s Gift Nearby\nNamed in recognition of the CBD pioneer Lawrence Ringo, Ringo\u2019s Gift imbues the consumer with a sense of wellbeing alongside steady relief in the body. Use this strain to take the edge off pain and stress, while allowing the mind to roam free without the shackles of paranoia or distracting euphoria.\n\nFind Charlotte\u2019s Web Nearby\nCharlotte\u2019s Web was the first CBD strain to receive media attention, and has achieved legendary status among CBD varieties ever since. Although its reputation is built upon its success in treating epilepsy, this strain has aided patients treating many other conditions including pain, anxiety, and inflammation. Charlotte\u2019s Web is grown by CW Pharmaceuticals in Colorado.\n\nFind Remedy Nearby\nRemedy is a high-CBD strain that quietly ushers in easy relaxation without mental fog. For consumers seeking something a little more relaxing than a cup of tea, Remedy offers a solution with effects that rid the mind of anxiety while soothing aches, pains, and inflammation.\n\nFind Sour Tsunami Nearby\nSour Tsunami has become a household name among high-CBD strains. This variety tends to produce less than 1-2% of THC, so you can reap its medicinal benefits without the high. Sour Tsunami is fairly prolific, so keep an eye out for this strain at your next dispensary visit if you\u2019re looking to quell pain or anxiety symptoms without the interference of THC.\n\nFind Hawaiian Dream Nearby\nIf you\u2019re looking to harness the benefits of THC and CBD but wary of getting too high, Hawaiian Dream is the strain for you. With a THC content of around 5% and a CBD profile stretching between 5-10%, Hawaiian Dream can help abate symptoms with only mild, gentle euphoria. As an added bonus, this strain throws in a little tropical flavor to sweeten the experience.\n\nFind Dance World Nearby\nDance World is a CBD-dominant strain that almost achieves a balanced CBD:THC ratio, making it especially appropriate for consumers struggling with pain, depression, and lack of appetite. This synergy of THC and CBD helps to inspire positivity and more vibrant moods by handing you subdued euphoria on a leash.\n\nFind Nordle Nearby\nNordle offers a balanced abundance of both THC and CBD that makes it especially suitable for patients dealing with pain, insomnia, muscle spasms, and anxiety. If your symptoms are keeping you up at night, Nordle is a great nightcap solution for dialing down pain and worries so you can spend less time tossing and turning.",

            "text": "CBD cannabis strains are hitting the market so fast, it\u2019s impossible to keep track of them all. The list below will familiarize you with the most common CBD varieties, but keep in mind that your dispensary probably stocks many others. If these popular strains aren\u2019t in stock or you\u2019d like to try something new, ask your budtender to point out other standout CBD strains and products.\nWhat is CBD, you might ask? CBD stands for cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating cannabis constituent with a variety of\u00a0studied\u00a0benefits such as:\n\nPain relief\nAnti-inflammatory\nAnti-epileptic\nAnti-anxiety\n\n\nA strain can be high in THC, CBD, or a combination of the two. Both compounds have unique medicinal properties, some of which are amplified when both compounds are present (e.g. pain management). High-CBD or mixed strains tend to be the best choices for consumers prone to anxiety. But ultimately, you\u2019ll be the one to decide which strain works best for you.\nNote that these strains tend to express consistent THC:CBD profiles, but you may encounter variations (e.g. ACDC may be found with little to no THC, or exhibit a balanced THC:CBD ratio). Always check each product\u2019s tested cannabinoid profile to be certain of its THC and CBD levels.\nTo see if one of the below CBD strains is available nearby, click the strain tile and scroll down to its Finder map.\nCommon High-CBD/Low-THC Strains\nPopular Uses: Epilepsy, severe anxiety, inflammation, fatigue\n\nCommon Mixed THC/CBD Strains\nPopular Uses: Pain, mild anxiety, insomnia, inflammation\n\nYou can search Leafly\u2019s strain database for more CBD strains, or contact your local dispensary to explore more options near you.",

            "text": "This bright and happy mixture of Maui Waui and Blue Dreams makes my heart skip a beat! I. Am. In. Love. Quite seriously and literally with everything. With my boyfriend, with my dog, with the weed I just smoked, with this peanut butter and banana sandwich I'm eating (holy crap I am IN LOVE with this sandwich!)... I feel so positive, like nothing could ever bring me down again, and I think I've declared this strain \"my favorite thing EVER\" at least half a dozen times since I smoked it twenty minutes ago.\nOn a more serious note, I went into this high already hungry, and barely felt like snacking when I was done smoking. When I did make myself food, however, I discovered it tasted so much better than I had expected. So I'm eating and enjoying it, but it's more because I'm enjoying the flavors, and I'm taking my time so I can savor each bite. \nI was also exhausted before I smoked and now I feel like I could muster up the strength to Do Something, if I had to. This one is a little hard to judge since, like I said, I was already really tired going into it, but I feel like it's worth mentioning that I do feel a nagging urge to go sketch. \nIt's doing AWESOME things for my Fibromyalgia aches and pains!! I was in extreme amounts of pain, probably around a 7, and I'd say I'm down to a comfortable 3 or so now (which is my baseline about as good as it ever gets). There is some anxiety, but it's not overwhelming. Now that I've eaten, it feels a little better. \n\nAnd after writing all of this, I have to conclude that it's also a very focused high that's allowing me to really get into what I'm doing. I feel very aware and alert, not at all clouded or impaired.\n\nFor perspective, I'm a many-times-over daily smoker.",
