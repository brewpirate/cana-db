            "text": "Received a half zip of this along with some Tahoe OG. The comparison is mind blowing; opening the Tahoe, and then the Hawaiian Haze. The HH is unbelievably light, could only fit 6g into my 1/4oz jar (which normally fits 8-9g comfortably). Appearance is exactly like that of the picture, an earthy mellow green with spaced out long curly light hairs. The smell is what instantly hits you as you open the jar. It's like a blast of tropical fruits, or flowers, and the first taste of the vape follows suit. It was my first time trying a Haze, and it was as somewhat expected. Despite the uplifting, talkative, sativa end of the strain, very prone to having your head up in the clouds when toked in larger amounts. Not particularly long lasting. Very euphoric, spacy stone. Beautiful bag appeal, and amazing smell. 9/10.",
