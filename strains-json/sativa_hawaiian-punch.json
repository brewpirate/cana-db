It gave my mind a balance where I can stay focused, where as, in my typical day where I don\u2019t smoke, my brain is almost always jumping from one task to the next. My body was relaxed. And of course it gives that feel good feeling.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel the anxiety, nervousness, paranoid that most people usually feel, but of course, as an individual who has PTSD, anxiety, this didn\u2019t heighten it at all.\n\nThe only thing I dealt with is trying to wake up, I slept really hard on it. (Which can be good if you struggle with sleep, however I have kids to get to school\ud83d\ude01) So, when I did wake up, I felt just a little groggy. \n\nThe taste is sweet, and smooth when smoking it. I will definitely try this again.",
