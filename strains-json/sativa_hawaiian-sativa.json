You slowly feel that you are entering another plane of existence. You slowly feel as if you are having a very vivid dream of a memory. The strain brings back memories depending on the outside stimuli. In other words, if you listen to a certain song, you will have memories of the time when you first listened to that song. \r\n--Sight: Colors are very pleasant. Everything seems nicer. If you walk outside, you will think to yourself it is a beautiful city. You once  again start seeing beauty in things you would barely even notice in your daily life. A nice solitary walk is very pleasant as you will have nice things to look at, unless you live in the ghetto or some other very screwed up place. You will also enjoy any form of media (except Fox news and reality shows). Reality shows will only be enjoyable if you are with a group of friends making fun of it. Stay clear of horror movies as well as gory ones. With this strain, or virtually any strain, your senses become more sensitive. Anything pleasant becomes more pleasant, and everything disgusting becomes far more disgusting. As for media, comedies are always good choices. Nostalgic movies (varies depending on your age) such as the American Pie series is very enjoyable. The reason I opt for nostalgic movies in particular is because it brings back memories of those times. When watching movies such as the American Pie series, I remember my teenage years. I remember my thoughts, dreams, ambitions and events of those times. The memories can sometimes be very vivid that for a few seconds i actually think I\u0027m a teenager again and this not 2011. By slightly exaggerating, I can say I partially relived my memories. Shows such as \"How I Met Your Mother\" can be very entertaining as well. I actually perceive cheesy moments as deliberately exaggerated for humor. The make belief becomes entertaining. Nevertheless, it all depends on personal taste. The general suggestion is to watch whatever you like. \r\nVideo games are very nice too. It is obvious to say that colorful Nintendo games are going to be extremely pleasant. Nostalgic games work too. Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, and Playstation games are definitely going to bring back memories of your days back then. You might notice the graphics are not impressive, but back then it was new and astonishing. You will probably laugh as you play these old games and ask yourself \"How did I really like these terrible graphics\"? All characters look like they were made of squares. \r\n--Hearing: Music is so pleasant. My suggestion is to listen to a relatively old song you haven\u0027t listened to for quite some time. You will notice the feeling of nostalgia as well as memories flooding your brain. I found out that 90s rock songs work best for me. For example, listening to \"Clumsy\" by Our Lady Peace floods my brain with memories of the 90s as well as childhood. When I listen to bands such as Sum 41, I get memories of my teen years. Not only do I experience memories, but for a moment i think it is 2004. In my experience, either nostalgic or calming rock songs work very well, as well as vocal trance. For vocal trance songs, I would suggest the following: \"Take Me Away\" by 4 Strings, \"Beautiful Things\" by Andain, \"Carry me Away(Vocal Mix)\" by Chris Lake and \"In and Out of Love\" by Armin Van Burren. A very soothing and relaxing rock song would be \"Soul Meets Body\" by Death Cab for Cutie. Once again, it all depends on personal preference. Therefore, you decide what to listen to. \r\n--Body: I experienced very little to no body high. My arms and legs work perfectly fine and I can move without effort. Needless to say, if I am already tired and lazy prior to using this strain I will continue to be lazy. \r\n--Side Note: I have discovered that if I sleep after using this strain, I wake up very refreshed. I wake up feeling very euphoric, optimistic, and positive in general. My mind is flooded with positive thoughts about the future. I feel good about myself and the world. An exaggerated and funny example of the way I feel would be the main character from \"Office Space\" after being hypnotized.     \r\nBottom line: This strain is very uplifting and induces nostalgia at first. It becomes very euphoric afterwards. Experiences may differ by individual. However, it is one of the best I have tried considering the fact that the good effects greatly outnumber the negative ones (which are simply dry mouth and roughness on throat in some people). It is also not one those strains where you can\u0027t function. However, that depends on how much you smoke or vaporize. I vaporize about 0.2 grams maximum in one session if it is by myself. Note that 0.2 grams is about half of the bowl in the Extreme Q Vaporizer.

All characters look like they were made of squares. \r\n--Hearing: Music is so pleasant. My suggestion is to listen to a relatively old song you haven\u0027t listened to for quite some time. You will notice the feeling of nostalgia as well as memories flooding your brain. I found out that 90s rock songs work best for me. For example, listening to \"Clumsy\" by Our Lady Peace floods my brain with memories of the 90s as well as childhood. When I listen to bands such as Sum 41, I get memories of my teen years. Not only do I experience memories, but for a moment i think it is 2004. In my experience, either nostalgic or calming rock songs work very well, as well as vocal trance. For vocal trance songs, I would suggest the following: \"Take Me Away\" by 4 Strings, \"Beautiful Things\" by Andain, \"Carry me Away(Vocal Mix)\" by Chris Lake and \"In and Out of Love\" by Armin Van Burren. A very soothing and relaxing rock song would be \"Soul Meets Body\" by Death Cab for Cutie. Once again, it all depends on personal preference. Therefore, you decide what to listen to. \r\n--Body: I experienced very little to no body high. My arms and legs work perfectly fine and I can move without effort. Needless to say, if I am already tired and lazy prior to using this strain I will continue to be lazy. \r\n--Side Note: I have discovered that if I sleep after using this strain, I wake up very refreshed. I wake up feeling very euphoric, optimistic, and positive in general. My mind is flooded with positive thoughts about the future. I feel good about myself and the world. An exaggerated and funny example of the way I feel would be the main character from \"Office Space\" after being hypnotized.     \r\nBottom line: This strain is very uplifting and induces nostalgia at first. It becomes very euphoric afterwards. Experiences may differ by individual. However, it is one of the best I have tried considering the fact that the good effects greatly outnumber the negative ones (which are simply dry mouth and roughness on throat in some people). It is also not one those strains where you can\u0027t function. However, that depends on how much you smoke or vaporize. I vaporize about 0.2 grams maximum in one session if it is by myself. Note that 0.2 grams is about half of the bowl in the Extreme Q Vaporizer.
