Where Hawaiian Snow really stands out is in its high, a very stimulating head buzz that is perfect for social interaction and creative endeavors.

It was.\n\nThe grow was my first (balcony grow), so it wasn't an abundant harvest despite it being a high yielding strain...mainly because of being a noobie and not really knowing how and what to do.  But, it was all worth it.  \n\nFor me, Hawaiian snow is a perfect strain for what I want was looking for...focussed, happy, creative, energetic...and what is really important is minimal paranoia and anxiety for the negative effects.  I was able to enjoy the high and love what i love about marijuana again.  If it wasn't for Leafly I know I probably would have never discovered this great strain.  \n\nFor now, this is my favorite strain and will be for a long time.  I would recommend Hawaiian Snow to anyone that has any negative anxiety/paranoia tendencies when they smoke, so you can enjoy all the amazing positive benefits that you love about it to begin with.",
