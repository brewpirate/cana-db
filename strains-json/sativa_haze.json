Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Purple Haze is a classic sativa strain made popular by the late Jimi Hendrix. Thought to be a cross of Purple Thai and Haze, this strain offers a stimulating and euphoric high. Its flavor is fruity, sweet, and earthy.\nGrow Techniques: Known to be a hardy, resilient strain, Purple Haze is a good choice for novice growers. Grow outside with healthy soil, or grow hydroponically. Prune and top the plant to keep a uniform and bushy shape while making sure to support the colas as they develop. The strain does not always produce purple buds, but you can lower the temperature of your grow room or grow outside to coerce purple hues.\nFlowering Time: 8-9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Easy\nClimate: Purple Haze does fine in northerly climates with colder nights, but prefers temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Outdoor gardens tend to produce bigger yields, but Purple Haze does well indoors as well.\nFeeding: Feed moderately during flowering, then bump up the phosphorus to maximize the yield.",

The cerebral high is a hard-hitter, makes me extremely focused, talkative and happy, it erases every iota of stress within me and gives me monster munchies. But it also causes a bit of paranoia for a few mins, which is easy to handle for me. One of my all time favs. But if u have a tendency or history with paranoia, then u shouldnt try this strain.",
