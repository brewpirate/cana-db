            "text": "This week's new strains have a little something for everyone! There are indicas, sativas, and hybrids, not to mention the full spectrum of flavors these strains produce \u2014 everything from sweet and skunky to fruity and floral. The effects these strains produce highlight many of the reasons that people consume cannabis, both for its medicinal value and the recreational experience.\nIf you've come across any of these tempting strains while searching the menu of your favorite dispensary, make sure you leave a review. But if you don't find one here that sparks your interest, try digging through the Leafly Strain Explorer \u2014 we're updating it all the time with suggestions from the Leafly community!\n\u00a0\n 1. Chocolate Fondue\n\nChocolate Fondue, bred by DNA Genetics, is a sativa-dominant cross that balances the uplifting effects of Chocolope with the relaxing effects and unique flavors of Exodus Cheese. The effects of Chocolate Fondue relax the body and calm the mind into a blissful state of consciousness. Its complex bouquet and sweet flavors make this cannabis strain enjoyable day or night.\n\n\u00a0\n 2. GI001\n\nGI001 is a sativa-dominant cannabis strain developed by one of Growth Industries\u2019 botanists. This strain is characterized by a lime green plant color, citrus taste, and high yields during cultivation. With little to no psychoactive effects, GI001 is a great alternative for those who don\u2019t want their medication to interfere with daily activities. Through Growth Industries\u2019 medical grade, standardized cultivation policies and procedures, GI001 boasts a CBD to THC ratio of 24:1 on a consistent basis. Currently, Growth Industries\u2019 strains are only available through authorized vendors and pharmaceutical raw material outlets.\n\n\u00a0\n 3. Milky Way\n\nMilky Way is an 80/20 indica-dominant blend bred by Kiwiseeds. Named for the milky white trichomes that cover its buds and sugar leaves, Milky Way has a sweet aroma with flavors of sugar and spice. Its effects are characterized as potent, relaxing, and full-bodied thanks to the heavy indica influence.\n\n\u00a0\n 4. Ebola #7\n\nEbola #7, also known as THCbola, is a blend of two popular California strains. It was created in the summer of 2012 when HendRx Farms\u2019 breeders crossed SFV OG with GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies). After an extensive phenotype hunt, #7 was selected for its high concentrations of THC that range between 24% \u2013 28% depending on cultivation methods. Ebola #7 received its unique name after it unintentionally spread throughout gardens in Humboldt County.\n\n\u00a0\n 5. Heisenberg Kush\n\nHeisenberg Kush is a cross of SC Blue Dream and Sin City Kush bred by Alphakronik Genes Seeds as part of their Great Minds series of genetics. Named for the renowned German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who is considered the pioneer of quantum mechanics, Heisenberg Kush is a fast-flowering, sativa-dominant blend that produces a spectrum of blue and purple hues. Skunky grape notes mix with earthy undertones of sandalwood and a sweet strawberry finish to create the invigorating flavor palate of Heisenberg Kush.\n\n\u00a0\n 6. Purple Pantera\n\nPurple Pantera is an indica-dominant hybrid bred by Snowhigh Seeds. The mix of Pink Panther and Grape Krush genetics produces dark purple hues and a piney OG Kush aroma that is highlighted by sweet grape notes with subtle berry undertones. This strain's fast-acting effects spark bursts of euphoria and deep relaxation that is best saved for the end of the day.\n\n\u00a0\n 7. Sin City Kush\n\nSin City Kush is an 80/20 indica-dominant cross of LVPK and Snowdawg bred by Alphakronik Genes Seeds. The buds of Sin City Kush are a mix of deep purple and green hues with a glossy coat of white trichomes and a compelling floral aroma. Don\u2019t expect to accomplish much when trying Sin City Kush \u2014 the indica influence weighs heavy on the body and mind, so this strain is best enjoyed after your daily tasks are complete.",
