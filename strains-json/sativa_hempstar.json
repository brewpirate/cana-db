It was so enticing that I literally accidentally snorted a little bit because I couldn't get enough of the smell.\nWhen you smoke it it tastes Mother Earth put her dick in a rain forest. And the high has me high enough that I just wrote that. Head feels nice and clear but very stoned at the same time.",
