Leave reviews for the ones you\u0027ve tried or check the links below to see if any are offered at a cannabis shop near you.\n \n  1. Alien Abduction\n\nAlien Abduction is an OG Kush hybrid bred by So-Cal medical collective Ocean Grown Genetics, who crossed an Alien OG male with the Ether cut of Alien Dawg. These seeds have been highly sought after by growers, as they are known to have great germination rates and multiple excellent phenotypes, all of which are robust and vigorous plants. Most phenotypes exhibit typical OG Kush smells and flavors, and pack a high-THC punch that combines a potent head buzz with a strongly sedating body high. For many patients, Alien Abduction is a great appetite stimulant and sleep aid.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Alien Abduction\n \n  2. Hurricane\n\nHurricane is a 70/30 sativa-dominant hybrid from Colorado breeders Reserva Privada that combines the spicy Haze genetics of Panama Punch with the OG Kush flavors of the award-winning LA Confidential. These flowers give off a mix of fruity smells with undertones of spice, and an earthy, herbal flavor when smoked or vaporized. Its potent mix of indica and sativa genetics produces a pleasant, giggly head high with a pain-relieving indica effects, and is generally considered suitable for daytime use.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Hurricane\n \n  3. Snow Leopard\n\nSnow Leopard, from the mysterious breeder Bodhi Seeds, is one of the more unique seed strains out there, crossing the dual multinational genetics of Tigermelon and Snow Lotus, both of which have strong Haze and Afghani influences as well as Thai and Mexican elements. The majority of observed phenotypes are indica-dominant plants that produce numerous sticky colas and a rich tropical smell with woody undertones. Known for its “creeper” effect, Snow Leopard will eventually leave the user in a tranquil cloud, lost in deep thought and glued to their seat.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Snow Leopard\n \n  4. Black Cherry Cheesecake\n\nThought to have originated in Southern Oregon from an unknown breeder, Black Cherry Cheesecake is an indica-dominant hybrid that supposedly crosses Black Cherry Soda, Super Silver Haze, and Cheese. These large, pink-tinged purple flowers smell like cherries and sugar, and possess a flavor that is aptly described by the name. Black Cherry Cheesecake leaves users relatively clear-headed while providing strong, sedating body sensations that can make motivation difficult.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Black Cherry Cheesecake\n \n  5. Blaze\n\nBritish Columbia Seed Company crossed the indica Blueberry with Haze in order to tame this lanky, long-flowering Blaze. This large sativa-dominant plant combines the soaring cerebral high and sweet-spicy smell of Haze, while getting shorter flowering times and a distinct dried-grape aroma from Blueberry. Blaze is closely related to Blueberry Haze and Blue Dream.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Blaze\n \n  6. Panda OG\n\nFrom Grow Op Farms’ Phat Panda line, Panda OG is a hybrid from Washington State that crosses two sativa-dominant hybrids, OG Chem and Berry Sour Cream. Combining a long-lasting cerebral high with a sedating body buzz, this strain is great for treating anxiety, appetite loss, and insomnia. Panda OG smells very spicy yet earthy, and tastes sour on the tongue with slight undertones of berry.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Panda OG\n \n  7. Madman OG\n\nAnother excellent hybrid from Southern California breeders Ocean Grown Genetics, Madman OG combines LA Confidential with OG Kush to create a powerful and delicious indica. Generally considered a high-THC strain, it has been tested at anywhere from 16-24%. Smooth coffee flavors give way to sour earthy undertones, with a fresh pine scent typical of many OG Kush varieties. Madman OG gives users a pleasant, relaxed body high that often leads to munchies and sleep.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Madman OG\n \nBrowse through other new strains that were added recently to the Leafly Explorer ,or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12001923/new-strains-alert-alien-abduction-snow-leopard-panda-og-madman-og.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-alien-abduction-snow-leopard-panda-og-madman-og"}],"reviewCount":44,"flavors":[{"name":"Berry","score":41.179078014184391},{"name":"Citrus","score":34.39716312056737},{"name":"Lemon","score":33.865248226950349},{"name":"Orange","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Lime","score":33.333333333333329}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":93.395390070921977},{"name":"Uplifted","score":91.400709219858143},{"name":"Happy","score":89.27304964539006},{"name":"Creative","score":44.902482269503544},{"name":"Talkative","score":42.774822695035454}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":54.343971631205669},{"name":"Nausea","score":47.960992907801412},{"name":"Depression","score":45.966312056737586},{"name":"Insomnia","score":35.460992907801412},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":34.929078014184391}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":52.748226950354606},{"name":"PTSD","score":41.710992907801412},{"name":"Arthritis","score":7.3138297872340425},{"name":"Asthma","score":6.7819148936170208},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":6.7819148936170208}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":47.960992907801412},{"name":"Dizzy","score":7.3138297872340425},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":7.3138297872340425},{"name":"Anxious","score":7.3138297872340425},{"name":"Headache","score":6.25}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_071e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/605615/b/hurricane__primary_a8de.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_d8fd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/569371/b/hurricane__primary_73ae.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_e4fe.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/555603/b/hurricane__primary_871e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_5737.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/507734/b/hurricane__primary_ed05.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_973e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/506034/b/hurricane__primary_dbfc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_f7a9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/505739/b/hurricane__primary_702a.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":11,"popularCities":["Detroit, MI","Edmonton, AB","Montréal, QC","Vancouver, BC","Everett, WA","Lansing, MI","Lynnwood, WA","Mountlake Terrace, WA","Mukilteo, WA","Roseneath, ON"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.31818181818182/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"LA Confidential","subtitle":null,"slug":"la-confidential","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/la-confidential","symbol":"La","applink":"leafly://strain/la-confidential"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

I only had a couple of hits and the high maintained its intensity for probably 2 hours before I started to come down. I got this at NETA in Northampton. I would buy it again. It is very good but a bit too much of a buzzy effect for me. I prefer a mellower high. THC was listed at 15.49. \nI hope this review helps others.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1626553,"username":"jemichaels","text":"This is the first strain I vaped after a long month of extreme anxiety, depression and general lack of liveliness.

Alien Abduction\n\nAlien Abduction is an OG Kush hybrid bred by So-Cal medical collective Ocean Grown Genetics, who crossed an Alien OG male with the Ether cut of Alien Dawg. These seeds have been highly sought after by growers, as they are known to have great germination rates and multiple excellent phenotypes, all of which are robust and vigorous plants. Most phenotypes exhibit typical OG Kush smells and flavors, and pack a high-THC punch that combines a potent head buzz with a strongly sedating body high. For many patients, Alien Abduction is a great appetite stimulant and sleep aid.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Alien Abduction\n \n  2. Hurricane\n\nHurricane is a 70/30 sativa-dominant hybrid from Colorado breeders Reserva Privada that combines the spicy Haze genetics of Panama Punch with the OG Kush flavors of the award-winning LA Confidential. These flowers give off a mix of fruity smells with undertones of spice, and an earthy, herbal flavor when smoked or vaporized. Its potent mix of indica and sativa genetics produces a pleasant, giggly head high with a pain-relieving indica effects, and is generally considered suitable for daytime use.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Hurricane\n \n  3. Snow Leopard\n\nSnow Leopard, from the mysterious breeder Bodhi Seeds, is one of the more unique seed strains out there, crossing the dual multinational genetics of Tigermelon and Snow Lotus, both of which have strong Haze and Afghani influences as well as Thai and Mexican elements. The majority of observed phenotypes are indica-dominant plants that produce numerous sticky colas and a rich tropical smell with woody undertones. Known for its “creeper” effect, Snow Leopard will eventually leave the user in a tranquil cloud, lost in deep thought and glued to their seat.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Snow Leopard\n \n  4. Black Cherry Cheesecake\n\nThought to have originated in Southern Oregon from an unknown breeder, Black Cherry Cheesecake is an indica-dominant hybrid that supposedly crosses Black Cherry Soda, Super Silver Haze, and Cheese. These large, pink-tinged purple flowers smell like cherries and sugar, and possess a flavor that is aptly described by the name. Black Cherry Cheesecake leaves users relatively clear-headed while providing strong, sedating body sensations that can make motivation difficult.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Black Cherry Cheesecake\n \n  5. Blaze\n\nBritish Columbia Seed Company crossed the indica Blueberry with Haze in order to tame this lanky, long-flowering Blaze. This large sativa-dominant plant combines the soaring cerebral high and sweet-spicy smell of Haze, while getting shorter flowering times and a distinct dried-grape aroma from Blueberry. Blaze is closely related to Blueberry Haze and Blue Dream.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Blaze\n \n  6. Panda OG\n\nFrom Grow Op Farms’ Phat Panda line, Panda OG is a hybrid from Washington State that crosses two sativa-dominant hybrids, OG Chem and Berry Sour Cream. Combining a long-lasting cerebral high with a sedating body buzz, this strain is great for treating anxiety, appetite loss, and insomnia. Panda OG smells very spicy yet earthy, and tastes sour on the tongue with slight undertones of berry.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Panda OG\n \n  7. Madman OG\n\nAnother excellent hybrid from Southern California breeders Ocean Grown Genetics, Madman OG combines LA Confidential with OG Kush to create a powerful and delicious indica. Generally considered a high-THC strain, it has been tested at anywhere from 16-24%. Smooth coffee flavors give way to sour earthy undertones, with a fresh pine scent typical of many OG Kush varieties. Madman OG gives users a pleasant, relaxed body high that often leads to munchies and sleep.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Madman OG\n \nBrowse through other new strains that were added recently to the Leafly Explorer ,or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12001923/new-strains-alert-alien-abduction-snow-leopard-panda-og-madman-og.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-alien-abduction-snow-leopard-panda-og-madman-og"}],"reviewCount":44,"flavors":[{"name":"Berry","score":41.179078014184391},{"name":"Citrus","score":34.39716312056737},{"name":"Lemon","score":33.865248226950349},{"name":"Orange","score":33.333333333333329},{"name":"Lime","score":33.333333333333329}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":93.395390070921977},{"name":"Uplifted","score":91.400709219858143},{"name":"Happy","score":89.27304964539006},{"name":"Creative","score":44.902482269503544},{"name":"Talkative","score":42.774822695035454}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":54.343971631205669},{"name":"Nausea","score":47.960992907801412},{"name":"Depression","score":45.966312056737586},{"name":"Insomnia","score":35.460992907801412},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":34.929078014184391}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":52.748226950354606},{"name":"PTSD","score":41.710992907801412},{"name":"Arthritis","score":7.3138297872340425},{"name":"Asthma","score":6.7819148936170208},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":6.7819148936170208}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":47.960992907801412},{"name":"Dizzy","score":7.3138297872340425},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":7.3138297872340425},{"name":"Anxious","score":7.3138297872340425},{"name":"Headache","score":6.25}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_071e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/605615/b/hurricane__primary_a8de.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_d8fd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/569371/b/hurricane__primary_73ae.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_e4fe.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/555603/b/hurricane__primary_871e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_5737.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/507734/b/hurricane__primary_ed05.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_973e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/506034/b/hurricane__primary_dbfc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/hurricane_100x100_f7a9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/505739/b/hurricane__primary_702a.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":11,"popularCities":["Detroit, MI","Edmonton, AB","Montréal, QC","Vancouver, BC","Everett, WA","Lansing, MI","Lynnwood, WA","Mountlake Terrace, WA","Mukilteo, WA","Roseneath, ON"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.31818181818182/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"LA Confidential","subtitle":null,"slug":"la-confidential","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/la-confidential","symbol":"La","applink":"leafly://strain/la-confidential"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
