Bewilderingly gobbled up ability to think straight but there remains a subtle sharpness that not only adds much needed contrast but really shows how staggeringly consuming the high gradually becomes. Like slow motion ego loss, haha. Vision is a bit muddy and out of focus. Very physical, though - sense of touch is extra stimulating. Music is real nice...captivating. It encompasses you down to an emotional, psychedelic level. The short attention span makes listening persistently surprising. Body relaxation feels like a post-massage high. Like someone just stopped rubbing my shoulders. Strong, stable sense of euphoria and self-assuredness. Noticeable sativa twinge has remained pretty consistent across my chest. It adds some intensity. Overall, though, the mental state feels quite nice and positive, with a comfortable resignedness. A strong high with character, not without its challenges, but rewarding in a worthwhile way, I think. Good for mood and sense of place. Plays up emotional sensitivity. Road trips...scenic hikes...rainy day music...","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/kZ3iwRmPT5O6arIA05kqrPWjazc=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net%2fdZCCCxYREQnXfPfK6mXSTpqotAY%3d%2f120x120%2fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3.amazonaws.com%252Fleafly%252Fbin%252FGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1387320,"username":"bachrach433","text":"*quite* potent, mesmerizing sativa. Not for the faint of heart but produces unbelievably amazing effects.\n\nI bought something at an Oregon dispensary marketed under the name \u0027Island,\u0027 but was described as essentially the same cross as what is on here so I assume it must be fairly close. You don\u0027t need to smoke too much of this to get blasted - my normal \u0027dose\u0027 for MJ of one large hand pipe bowl was enough to put me in the stratosphere. \n\nIt hits you hard head on and gave me a nice mix of euphoria, pleasant body buzz, sociality and intense creativity, glued together by an occasionally overpowering intoxication. Terrible attention span but still capacity to focus.
