Mt. Cook\n\nNamed after the highest peak in New Zealand, Mt. Cook by Kiwiseeds is a former Cannabis Cup champion.

Island Maui Haze\n\nIsland Maui Haze is a 75/25 sativa-dominant strain with effects that can creep up on you. These dense, forest green buds may not initially attract you based on its strong, ammonia smell; however, this crystal-covered strain is praised for its uplifting, energetic effects that can relieve pain and other symptoms without bringing you down into a lazy state.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Island Maui Haze\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Leda Uno\n\nA Cannabis Cup finalist in the sativa category, Leda Uno will undoubtedly raise your spirits. The team at KC Brains took its KC 33 crossed with a Brazilian female landrace and crossed it once more with its KC 606 and Leda hybrid.

            "text": "Hits you aside the head first. Bewilderingly gobbled up ability to think straight but there remains a subtle sharpness that not only adds much needed contrast but really shows how staggeringly consuming the high gradually becomes. Like slow motion ego loss, haha. Vision is a bit muddy and out of focus. Very physical, though - sense of touch is extra stimulating. Music is real nice...captivating. It encompasses you down to an emotional, psychedelic level. The short attention span makes listening persistently surprising. Body relaxation feels like a post-massage high. Like someone just stopped rubbing my shoulders. Strong, stable sense of euphoria and self-assuredness. Noticeable sativa twinge has remained pretty consistent across my chest. It adds some intensity. Overall, though, the mental state feels quite nice and positive, with a comfortable resignedness. A strong high with character, not without its challenges, but rewarding in a worthwhile way, I think. Good for mood and sense of place. Plays up emotional sensitivity. Road trips...scenic hikes...rainy day music...",

            "text": "*quite* potent, mesmerizing sativa. Not for the faint of heart but produces unbelievably amazing effects.\n\nI bought something at an Oregon dispensary marketed under the name 'Island,' but was described as essentially the same cross as what is on here so I assume it must be fairly close. You don't need to smoke too much of this to get blasted - my normal 'dose' for MJ of one large hand pipe bowl was enough to put me in the stratosphere. \n\nIt hits you hard head on and gave me a nice mix of euphoria, pleasant body buzz, sociality and intense creativity, glued together by an occasionally overpowering intoxication. Terrible attention span but still capacity to focus. Can produce a bit of anxiety, but it's totally manageable. \n\n~~However~~ I must say that as a musician, this shit gives me the most ridiculous creative urge ever. Like I can't pull myself away from the piano, and just vibe with the music so hard. I really think artistic types should all try it. ",
