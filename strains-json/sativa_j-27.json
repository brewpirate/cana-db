It is the parent of the now popular Tangerine or Tangie cross, it has been passed off as Grapefruit by some although it is a much better strain than the GF, effect wise. It is the citrus smell that has made the name get thrown around, as it appears even by Leafly\u0027s review not many seem to know the real history. Let me explain it. It has no Jack in it although I know how that rumor got started too. It was first obtained as a series of J- strains from Oakland C.B.C. back in 2000. It was seeded (2 seeds) accidently-with a mixed room of all J-strains all obtained from O.C.B.C. (J2, J5, J7, J27 etc..) If you wan the lineage- find who started the J\u0027s in 99\u0027-2000. It has a immediate uplifting high, however the high can be intense and induce anxiety. The smell is potent enough to cause concern in public- sweet like tangie at finish cure- like a pungent sour grapefruit at harvest. Heavy yields, with fat cola\u0027s with potential for softball size nugs. Medium to tall height, rarely under 4\u0027. It is a bit tricky to grow, not the stablest strain. Its entered at least one contest (2003 norml sponsored) ,and it tied with Super Silver Haze. Add to the confusion- I read a review that said the strain was from Ed Rosenthal -but to clear that up, I passed the strain to Ed in 2004. Yes he probably made it a bit more popular. It was around before Ed had it, and even before I reseeded it. OCBC summer of 1999 it appeared.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"},{"id":1335034,"username":"jaxygyrl","text":"This medium green flower has deep, golden veins and distinctly over-ripe citrus smell.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the silly, giggly, bounce-to-music magic begins.
