            "text": "Fall is here, and many of us are waving goodbye to summer with smiling, pumpkin spice-stained faces stuffed into scarves. The new season not only inspires a change in wardrobe, but often a change in our stash boxes. These cannabis strains and products are known to fuel the cozy feels as the days get darker, leaves turn, and rain speckles the sidewalks outside. So load up, snuggle up, and smoke up, because fall is finally here.\n1. Jack Herer\n(Leafly)\nSativa-dominant Jack Herer is a strain for all seasons, but this sweet, pine-scented bud is especially well-suited for autumn. The warm, spicy flavor fills the body with a comfy, cozy sensation throughout every limb while wrapping the mind in a blissful blanket. And for those mourning the loss of long summer days, Jack Herer offers a comforting hand to help pull you from low moods.\n\n2. Infused Syrups\n(Courtesy of Craft Elixirs)\nWhat\u2019s better than a hot drink on a windy fall morning? Cannabis-infused hot drinks, obviously. Infused syrups are hitting the market with ferocity, blessing our mugs with the gift of enhanced flavor and effect. Add Craft Elixirs\u2019 CBD Ginger to your green tea for feelings of clean relaxation that lets you stay productive and stress-free, or find an infused maple syrup to add to your morning latte. Or, simply make infused syrup yourself by following this recipe.\n\n3. Agent Orange\n(Leafly)\nWith an invigorating citrus flavor that warms both mind and body, Agent Orange is a versatile hybrid strain that perfectly accompanies hobbies both relaxing and active. Take Agent Orange out on an autumn hike and watch as its euphoric veil enhances the red, yellow, and orange colors around you. Puff on this one while stuck inside on a rainy day, giving yourself permission to relax with some video games or a new show. Agent Orange also brings out the best flavors in chai tea, a hot toddy, or a cinnamon hot chocolate.\n\n4. Pre-Rolled Joints\n\nFew pleasures match the feeling of walking through an orange-hued forest with a joint in-hand. Whether you never learned how to roll a joint or feel pressured to spend every available second appreciating the fleeting colors of fall, pre-rolls make a convenient mobile choice. Numerous pre-roll options await you, but my favorite remains the Saints variety pack from Seattle Green Bud. (More Leafly staff favorites can be found here.)\n\n5. Vanilla Kush\n(Leafly)\nVanilla Kush is a cozy indica staple that delivers autumn vibes with a toasty vanilla flavor that sits underneath warm, earthy overtones. Bringing a gentle euphoric hum to the mind while letting muscles sink like dead weight into blankets, use this indica to cozy up with a book or movie, or let it guide you into a well-deserved nap on a rainy weekend.\n\n6. Infused Bath Bombs\n(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)\nAs temperatures drop outside, the urge to dip into a steaming bathtub gets hard to fight. Light a few candles, turn on some relaxing music, and sink into a hot spring sizzling with cannabis. You can take a lovely cannabis-infused bath thanks to magical bath soaks like those from Cannabis Basics, Mary Jane\u2019s Medicinals, and other favorites. Does your local dispensary not carry bath products? Just make your own bath bombs with this recipe.",

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: A classic strain developed in the Netherlands, Jack Herer is a cross between Northern Lights #5 and Shiva Skunk. The name comes from the cannabis activist Jack Herer. This strain offers a clear, motivating, and creative high that has launched this strain to global fame. There are a number of phenotypes, most of which are sativa-dominant while less common is the indica phenotype.\nGrow Techniques: Jack Herer is a great option for hydroponic systems, but it likes to grow bushy so make sure there is enough spacing between plants. If growing the sativa phenotype, be aware of stretching and make sure they do not outgrow your space. Also ensure that the branches are supported as the buds develop to prevent any from snapping.\nFlowering Time: 8-9 weeks\nYield: Moderate (indica phenotype); low to moderate (sativa phenotype)\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate to hard\nClimate: Moderate climates with temperatures between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Grows well in indoor hydroponic gardens where the feeding and climate can be controlled. If you have a known sativa phenotype and live in a climate with warm fall weather, let Jack Herer grow outside and see how truly massive a sativa can get.\nFeeding: Sativa-dominant plants can be vulnerable to overfeeding. Make sure to feed lightly at first, looking out for nutrient blockage or burn. Flush plants if you ever feel like you have overfed. Silica-based foods will help the plant develop thicker stems to support the buds.",

            "text": "Jack Herer is my morning medicine.  I take it daily every morning before work, and it turns me into a happy, focused, energized person completely capable of working and talking to people without tripping over my tongue.  I was severely depressed for several months, then I started taking Jack every morning and my world view changed completely.  And btw, reading the other reviews makes me shake my head in disapproval.  For one thing, Jack is a sativa-dominant strain that will put your head in the clouds and it has just the perfect amount of indica in it to keep your feet on the ground.  Do not expect it to work well as a sleep aid, people!  Indicas are typically good for sleep and anxiety, sativas are typically good for energy and depression.  Doing a sativa strain even early in the morning has affected my sleep pater that night, so be careful and make sure to have some indica to help you come down off the sativa high later on.  Another thing that perplexed me, was reading about that guy who did a bunch of it in Amsterdam.  Jack is a SUPER potent strain, I do not recommend doing like that guy did, he obviously did too much.   Sativas can give you a bad trip, so to speak, if you do too much, at least for us types who have issues with anxiety.  Jack can absolutely help you focus, if you do like one nice big hit off a vaporizer and let it ride.  If you do too much you'll feel like you're on crack, at least that's been my experience with all sativa-dominants.  Sativas are not to be taken lightly. It's not like indica where you can do bowl after bowl till you pass out.  Sativa will energize you and speed up your thoughts, making it great for depression but not great for sleep aid or anxiety.  Jack just happens to have the perfect blend of both to treat stress, depression, anxiety, and lack of motivation.  This strain replaced my need for ADD and OCD prescription pills. Thank you, Sensi Seeds, for creating one of the best strains on the planet!!! -dbvapor ",
