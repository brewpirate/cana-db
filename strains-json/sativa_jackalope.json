Expect either a more sativa influenced chocolate pheno or a darker, more dense, fruitier Black Jack pheno. Both share the same taste and high but the sativa pheno is less fruity. Taste is slight raw chocolate with some berries and a hint of incense/opium. High is speedy with a slight sedative after effect. Never waste this in a blunt or joint, this is a plant worth tasting.",
