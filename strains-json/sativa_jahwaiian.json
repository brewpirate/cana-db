Sledger (author of the song Rebel Music/3 O'clock roadblock) while filming the documentary \"Sledger\" that is now available on Youtube.\n\nLambsbread can be seen in the documentary and was a favorite strain of Bob Marley's still cultivated to this day by his family in Jamaica.\n\nHawai'i '78 also known as: \"Sweet lady of Waiahole\" and \"Jurassic Bud\" (a local strain cultivated near where they filmed Jurassic Park),a Hawaiian landrace from Waiahole, O'ahu.\n\nWe pollinated our sweetest Wahine (female) Lambsbread crossing her with a strong and powerful Kane (male) Hawai'i '78 and the results have been nothing short of spectacular!!\n\nRetaining what makes each individual strain special all the while complimenting the other combining unique island flavors and going absolutely crazy with hybrid vigor.\n\nAll profits from Jahwaiian and Lambsbread brought in by Pua Mana 'Ohana will be returned to Bradda Sledger for the benefit the community of Nine Mile Jamaica.\n\nAs Bob would want it to be, so mote it be.\n\nMahalo (thanks) to Bradda Sledger and Pua Mana 'Ohana; it is so.\n\nAloha a hui hou\nPua Mana 'Ohana",
