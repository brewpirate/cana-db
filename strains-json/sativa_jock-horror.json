            "text": "Jock Horror is a twist on the family of strains that arose around the Jack Herer name. The mother is a Haze 19 x Skunk, a hazey hybrid cross of Holland and California strains. Jock's father is an old-school Northern Lights, a mostly indica plant taken from a 20-year stable Afghan x Skunk #1 cross whose line was preserved in the marijuana mecca of America's Pacific northwest.\r\n\r\nJock Horror is its own original strain derived from the breeding work and the genetic collection of the Nirvana team. In this interpretation, Nirvana combines a sativa haze, hybrid Skunk, and indica Northern Lights in a three-way cross that is mostly sativa.\r\nJock Horror\u2019s rich flavour is made up of sweet and citrus elements wrapped in a sharp, Hazey tang. When smoked, its effect is a combination of powerful body stone and soaring cerebral high.  It is a good strain for going out dancing, enjoying time with friends, or just making something dull more tolerable and possibly entertaining.\r\n",

If you enjoy indica and want to try a sativa without it being too strong of a sativa this will do. \n\nThe munchies are uncontrollable at least for me on this one, and its the reason I probably wont use it again. Since I am a daily user and the will power to stop the craving isn't strong enough :P\n\nThe smells and taste and standard of good quality but nothing special.",
