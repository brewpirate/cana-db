            "text": "Cross strain between Cannatonic and Johnny Wonder. Flower tested at 2.3% THC / 7.34% CBD. I was skeptical about the strain at first but after smoking, the effects almost immediately kicked in. If you are looking for a chill yet very focused strain, this is the ONE! If you are highly sensitive to THC after many years of smoking, this bud has 0-None paranoia effects. Great for medicinal treatments. I would highly recommend this bud to anyone looking to rebuild internally. CBD does wonders to the body and mind. Give this strain a try if you want to feel well maintained and completely happy all around. Two thumbs up from the HV Crew! ",
