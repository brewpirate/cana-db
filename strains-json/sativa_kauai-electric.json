            "text": "This is the true story about the Kauai electric strain I'm a local haole that grew up on Kauai from the mid 50s my friends and I grew different varieties around the east side of Kauai and we decided to go up the power line trail because was always raining up there but had one Chain gate. So we cut the chain and put our own lock on the Chain gate but also there was a big brass padlock that had the Kauai electric logo embossed on it, one day I told my friend wow that would make one good 1 Hit Pipe yeh so when we got home my friend handed me one just like it that he got somewhere else and I made up a brass one hit the pipe from the Kauai Electric lock! anyway that year someone gave me a copy of the cultivators guide to marijuana and we were trying some of the methods to get make the plant better anyway I had 40 seedlings and then about 12 or 14 of them came out all crooked had variegated leaves polypod and when they turned into flowers they had large pods and red hairs and the leaves were variegated really sweet smelled almost like oranges and extra sticky, so anyway when I went Bussum out a friend of mine who was a drummer in a band from Kapaa, when you look at me said eh bra what kind we weed dis? I went looked down at my lock pipe and I said, \"Kauai Electric!\" And that's how the strand was born, this is the true story about Kauai Electric and if I name the names, everybody new us guys from surfing, to hitting the discos, to eating breakfast at ma's place we were notorious back then but now everybody knows the true story about Kauai Electric",
