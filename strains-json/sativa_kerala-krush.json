When I smoked this, I struggled to identify what sweet flavour I was tasting, but it reminded me of a combination between mango and peach. It also had a sooth spicy flavour.  This strain is great for nuseau or menstral cramps.  It also gives off an energetic and clear buzz that makes functioning not an issue at all.  Good for daytime use on those mornings you are struggling to get going.",
