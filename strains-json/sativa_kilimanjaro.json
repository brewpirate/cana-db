            "text": "Many thanks to our Leafly app users who requested new strains this week! Did your strain submission make it into Leafly's database this time around ? Yes? Great. Now make it your ultimate mission to rate it, leave a review, and maybe upload some photos while you're at it. We've highlighted five new additions below, but keep scrolling down to check out even more new strains or simply go to the Leafly Explorer and sort by newest.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a01. Pineapple Jack\nCharacteristics of Pineapple Jack:\n\nPineapple Jack is a mostly sativa cannabis strain whose Jack Herer and Pineapple genetics collide, combining their soaring, blissful effects in unison. Tropical fruit and citrus flavors meet the earthy, piney taste of Jack Herer in an unusual pairing of island and tundra aromas. Weightless euphoria lifts the spirits, helping you keep your chin held high amidst stress and depression while still leaving you feeling active and productive.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a02. Double OG\nCharacteristics of Double OG:\n\nDouble OG combines the powerhouse indica properties of Big Bud Afgoo and SFV OG to create a sedating strain ideal for body aches and sleepless nights. Though often regarded as too potent for novices, Double OG\u2019s knock-out effects are well-suited for experienced consumers with a high THC tolerance. Deep relaxation of the mind and body brings relief to stress\u00a0and anxiety while also calming muscle spasms, tremors, and pain.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Green Goddess\nCharacteristics of Green Goddess:\n\nGreen Goddess is an indica-dominant hybrid that descends from Skunk #1 and Sweet Leaf Indica. With an aroma that blends notes of rose with ruby red grapefruit, this hybrid offers a divine flavor profile that brings justice to her name. Crystal-coated emerald buds are wrapped with vibrant amber hairs in a display as enticing as Green Goddess\u2019 fragrance. Blissful euphoria rushes through the mind, bringing with it a surge of focus and intrigue while eradicating life\u2019s stressors.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a04. Kilimanjaro\nCharacteristics of Kilimanjaro:\n\nKilimanjaro is a pure sativa landrace from the mountain slopes of Kenya, where it was originally cultivated for use in hunting and religious practice by the native population. Tribes commonly referred to this strain as the \u201celephant stomper\u201d and utilized it for its energetic, hyper effects. Its aroma carries notes of lemony citrus and fruit, and Kilimanjaro\u2019s tall growth makes it ideal for outdoor or greenhouse gardens.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. White Cheese\nCharacteristics of White Cheese:\n\nWhite Cheese from Zambeza Seeds is an indica-dominant hybrid that crosses Cheese genetics with Super Skunk and Afghani. It carries the skunky cheese aroma with an earthy note and provides relaxing indica effects without being a total knock-out. Its euphoric buzz keeps away stress and anxiety. The short flowering cycle, compact nature, and large yields make White Cheese especially attractive to growers.\n\nDon't forget to check out the other new additions!",

Even sad things seem silly (I'm almost ashamed to say this)....If you want to be pulled out of a bad mood, this is the weed for you. \n\nPhysically, it feels like your head and neck are stretching away from your body.

I instantly feel relaxed but am still able to function and stay productive throughout the day. This Sativa does not make you tired but more of a calming effect. Seemed to help my anxiety and depression. A definite must try. A very close #2 to my fave strain of all time...White Fire OG",
