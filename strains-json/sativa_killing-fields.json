            "text": "Whether you want to properly celebrate Friday the 13th or are simply in the mood for some elevated frights, here are 13 strains that each have an appropriate scary movie to pair. Enjoy, and remember, that creaking noise you hear coming from the creepy corner of the house is nothing more than a figment of your imagination\u2026\n1. Killer Queen / Carrie\n\nSkip the remake and go with the original 1976 adaptation of the Stephen King novel about an unpopular teenage girl with an overbearing mom. Typical high school angst, right? Not when the teenage girl is telekinetic and a wee bit unstable.\nYou probably don\u2019t want to pull a mean prank on her during the prom\u2014instead, offer her some Killer Queen, a hybrid that yields happy, uplifting effects. Sounds like a match made in sticky, bloody heaven.\n2. Pennywise / It\n\nYou have the option to cue up the original\u00a0It\u00a0TV miniseries or check out the 2017 film adaptation of the Stephen King novel. Either way, you\u2019ll be confronted with one of the scariest horror movie villains you\u2019ll peek through your fingers to catch a glimpse of.\nClowns are creepy enough on their own, but a sewer-dwelling razor-teethed clown that eats children will provide enough nightmare fuel that you might need some of the indica Pennywise strain to relax you back down into a state where you aren\u2019t likely to pee yourself at any given moment.\u00a0Just remember, they all float down here\u2026\n\n3. Jack the Ripper / The Shining\n\nI know that the historic Jack the Ripper went after prostitutes in ye olde timey London, but when I think of a scary Jack, only one man comes to mind: Mr. Torrance from yet another Stephen King novel-turned-movie, The Shining.\nIt may be a little less unnerving to watch\u00a0the family man become unhinged as a brutal winter keeps his wife and son held captive inside the sinister Overlook Hotel if you pair the experience with the happiness-inducing Jack the Ripper hybrid. Better yet, chase that strain with some appropriately-named\u00a0Jack Frost once the axe-wielding papa succumbs to that tricky hedge maze.\n4. Alien OG \u2013 Alien\n\nFinally, an entry that didn\u2019t come from the warped mind of Stephen King! This Ridley Scott classic boasts impressive special effects and the clever tagline, \u201cIn space, no one can hear you scream.\u201d\nSure,\u00a0Alien practically invented the \u201cWhat\u2019s that scary rustling in the corner? Oh, it\u2019s just the damn cat OH CRAP A MONSTER\u2019S TRYING TO EAT ME\u201d horror movie trope, but it\u2019s still a top entry in my book mainly because Ellen Ripley is one of the most bad-ass female protagonists in movie history. Celebrate her victory over the drooling, acid-blooded behemoth with a little Alien OG, a hybrid strain with earthy and pine flavors that will make you relieved you\u2019re save and sound back here on Earth.\n\n5. Little Devil / The Exorcist\n\nFrom the iconic creepy-sounding score to the \u201cyou\u2019ll never look at pea soup the same again\u201d projectile vomiting, The Exorcist is a horror movie classic. A poor little girl gets possessed by the devil and promptly behaves like the Antichrist (or like those girls on My Super Sweet Sixteen).\nAfter you watch her spider-crawl down the stairs, you might want to chase that scene with some high-THC Little Devil to bring your heart rate back down to a normal range.\n6. Ghost OG / Poltergeist\n\n\u201cYou just moved the headstones! You didn\u2019t move the bodies!!\u201d Poltergeist is a cautionary tale as to why you should avoid buying houses built over ancient Indian burial grounds no matter how sweet the deal may seem.\nPair this spooky ghost thriller with the hybrid Ghost OG for a sweet counterbalance to all of the sour supernatural events that plague the Freeling family. Just make sure you peace out if your TV turns on by itself and is all staticky (and whatever you do, don\u2019t go into the light).\n\n7. Zombie OG / Night of the Living Dead\n\nIf you\u2019re going to enjoy some Zombie OG, it\u2019s only fitting to pair the earthy indica with the 1968 classic that kicked off over 45 years of zombie mania, George Romero\u2019s Night of the Living Dead. The black and white film doesn\u2019t bother with happy endings, just wave after wave of undead citizens keen on taking a bite out of anyone within a rotted arm\u2019s reach.\nIf you want to extend your movie marathon, I recommend following up the original with the iconic Dawn of the Dead, a cheeky wink at our society\u2019s zombie-like consumerist ways, and Day of the Dead, which takes the horror underground to\u00a0a military bunker.\n8. Killing Fields / The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\n\nThe 1974 horror classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was so unsettling, some people actually thought it was a real snuff film. What\u2019s remarkable about the movie\u00a0is that it isn\u2019t gory at all\u2014the creepy family and the film\u2019s realistic, grimy\u00a0feel mess with your head and make you think it\u2019s\u00a0more grisly than it actually is.\nWhile watching, partake in the sativa Killing Fields so you\u2019ll have some energy to sprint across a field if Leatherface bursts through your door wielding a gas-powered killing apparatus.\n\n9. Pandora\u2019s Box / Hellraiser\n\nThis \u201980\u2019s horror offering is a cautionary tale for anyone who comes across a mysterious puzzle box in a creepy knickknacks shop. Stop, put down the box, and buy a snow globe instead; otherwise, you might accidentally summon some nasty-looking dudes who are all-too keen on dragging you to hell.\nPair Hellraiser with the sweet, grapefruity Pandora\u2019s Box for a little juxtaposition as you watch a dude with pins in his face rip a guy apart with some rusty chains.\n10. Kali Mist / The Mist\n\nHere\u2019s one more Stephen King entry for your horror movie marathon. The Mist is a surprisingly good\u00a0film from 2007 that follows a man and his son\u00a0as they struggle to survive against the evils of both otherworldly creatures and mankind after a mysterious mist rolls through a small town.\u00a0The ending is bleak and if you opt to watch the black and white version, it\u2019ll seem even more eerie.\nHelp clear your mood afterwards with some Kali Mist, which delivers happy, uplifting effects to counterbalance the dread you experience while watching this bummerfest.\n\n11. Mother\u2019s Finest / Psycho\n\nYou think you\u2019ve got mommy issues? This iconic Hitchcock film\u00a0is the ultimate example of \u201cThis dude needs therapy and a hug.\u201d Stay far, far\u00a0away from the pointless Gus Van Sant remake and opt for the original 1960 classic.\nExperience Psycho with the sweet sativa\u00a0Mother\u2019s Finest\u00a0and make sure to lock the bathroom door before you hop into the shower.\n12. OG Shark / Jaws\n\nThe original summer blockbuster that made millions of people afraid to dip a toe into the ocean, Jaws is one of my all-time favorite movies. Given how every other classic horror movie has suffered through an inferior remake, it says a lot about this Steven Spielberg offering that nobody has dared to touch this masterpiece since it first debuted.\nPartake in the hybrid OG Shark and bask in its diesel flavor when Brody shouts \u201cSmile, you son of a bitch!\u201d and blows the massive great white shark to smithereens.\n\n13. Funky Monkey / Dead Alive\n\nOkay, admittedly this warped film from Peter Jackson is more funny-gross than scary, but Dead Alive is\u00a0still a classic in its own right and a cautionary example of why you shouldn\u2019t mess with rabid Sumatran rat-monkeys.\nEnjoy some of the indica Funky Monkey and giggle it up while you watch a priest kick ass for the Lord and an unlikely protagonist wield a lawnmower against a room full of nasty undeads.\nWhat are some of your favorite movies you can\u2019t wait to watch tonight? Share in the comments and we\u2019ll think of strain pairings to go with them!",

    "description": "<p>Killing Fields is the result of some clever breeding by Sannie&rsquo;s Seeds. Using two of their own strains, The One and Jack, they&rsquo;ve come up with this sativa that is known for its complex aroma. Killing fields packs a candy sugar and spice mix with notes of berry and citrus. It feels like a treat, especially for patients looking for something tasty. Like many sativas, this strain is slower to flower at 11-13 weeks. It grows tall, so space is a must, especially since these plants do best indoors. When the buds do show up, they will be large foxtails of dark green and blue. This is one for sativa lovers with a strong, cerebral feeling that lasts.</p>\n",
