Haze and White Widow are among my favorite strains of all time and to see what has become of the two is very exciting! Beautiful dark orange hairs on these buds that are completely coated in crystals. The taste is earthy with a nice sweetness. The high is VERY functional and clear headed. Nobody could tell I was stoned at work because it had me very focused and I didn't look high at all. Highly recommend this strain to anybody who loves it's lineage and for anyone looking for a good sativa! Green Therapeutics did a wonderful thing here! b-Myrcene: 3.59 mg/g, trans-Ocimene: 1.1 mg/g, b-Caryophylene: 0.9 mg/g.",
