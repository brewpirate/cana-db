This is a VERY powerful haze.  I tried a few tokes and am very hazy. But also very focused and aware. This is a must have for any Haze fan. I tried Purple Haze before and this is right up there, more powerful tho. I will append this if things change, but so far. Its a 9/10.. Pick some up before its gone. I\u0027ll try to add pics later.
