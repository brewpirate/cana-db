            "text": "This strain always becomes the Queen of my legal--I have temporal lobe epilepsy from head injuries--garden, regardless of anything else I am growing. She gets gigantic and can easily produce over five-pounds per plant outdoors. Her potency I would place at 16.8% THC with a fantastic balance between mind, and body effects. Great for musician's who--like me--can practice for hours if properly motivated; Leda will make your instrument call to you! Great for anti-seizure, joint-pain and sleep if you consume in larger doses. \n\nNOTE: She attracts both varieties of the awful spider-mite, and scale like nobody's business so keep your Liquid-Ladybug, or Aza-Max close by as she can be a difficult grow if you don't keep the pests away. \n\nYou may also find the illusive phenotype Leda Uno Negra (One Black Lady) as I have; she is spectacular!",
