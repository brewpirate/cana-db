            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and Botanicare\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: A cross between Lemon Skunk and Silver Haze, Lemon Haze offers an uplifting high alongside a zesty lemon aroma. Known to produce high levels of the citrusy terpene limonene, Lemon Haze\u2019s scent alone can stimulate the mind and body.\nGrow Techniques: Be aware of your grow space and make sure you have room for the plants to stretch when they begin to flower. Topping the plants in vegetation will help distribute the growth to the lower parts of the plant and even out the canopy. Trellis or stake your garden to support the buds as they take on weight. Lemon Haze grows well as a hydroponic plant where you can speed up the rate of development and get an early harvest.\nFlowering Time: 9-10 weeks\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Warm climates with temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Lemon Haze is a strain that grows best indoors where a warm climate can be maintained. If grown outdoors, make sure your climate stays warm enough to handle the long flowering cycle; otherwise, the buds might not grow to their fullest potential.\nFeeding: Sativa-dominant strains should be carefully fed. Silica is recommended for strengthening the branches as the buds start to gain weight in their flowering cycle.",

It went down so smooth I would gladly swap this for air if I could. And to top it off, it tastes amazing.\r\nThere are not many strains better than this one, with everything positive and it cured my depression, lack of appetite and pain.\r\nI tried this with blueberry rizzla, and let me tell you, Jamie Oliver couldn't make a better tasting product, that shit was magical.\r\nWould definitely recommend, however I felt a tad dizzy when it started to wore off, probably because it blew me away.",
