    "description": "<p>Lemon Ice by Ripper Seeds is a sativa-dominant strain created from <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-haze\">Lemon Haze</a> x <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani\">Afghani</a>. This collision of opposites creates a unique strain with columnar bud structures that adapts well to &ldquo;sea of green&rdquo; growing methods. The strain is also known for its furry buds knotted with <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/cannabis-anatomy-the-parts-of-the-plant\">pistils</a> and a spicy, citrus-forward aroma. Lemon Ice does have a longer than average flowering time of 75-85 days, but patient gardeners are rewarded with a more than generous yield. Ripper Seeds defines the effects as &ldquo;bearable,&rdquo; which translates to &ldquo;mind your dosage&rdquo; as strong sativa effects can be hard to handle for those prone to anxiety.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n",

It leaves you in such a good mood  and I have a good amount of anxiety, but it was gone with lemon ice. Nothing negative crosses your kind and it\u2019s like you\u2019re passing through time. I didn\u2019t feel any rush of energy nor creativity, but you can literally do anything on this high. I\u2019ve done my workout and school work on this high with no problem. Don\u2019t hesitate on getting it! It\u2019s not my favorite but for sure one I\u2019ll try to get friend one.",
