The strain will make you very energetic but also make you hella paranoid. This is an alternative to adderall as a study aid, because it gives you hyper focus, so for its perfect for programmers.

I could see Lemon Jack producing a bit of anxiety in larger doses unless you go out and run around with it.Its ok for wake and bake,and the come down isn\u0027t as  strong as Sour D.For Jack Herer versions, I only need Premium Jack. One odd note, making tinctures with most Jack Herer versions  have produced some of the most awful tasting tinctures Ive ever made. Only straight JH, Premium Jack,and Lemon Jack have  tasted ok. Others I made,like Black Jack, Critical Jack,  have been so rotten tasting in tincture I had to throw them away.  JH pheno types are strange like that.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/5DsWrIpoq-56NpD59UXAqpoVN88=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fqSLuo6zNRCeIia1paBYS_wayfarers-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3589","title":"Top 10 Strains to Combat Crohn’s Disease and Colitis","author":"Lisa Rough","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1417562220000)\/","text":"This week is Crohn’s Disease and Colitis Awareness week. For those of you that don’t know, Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are gastrointestinal disorders in a group of conditions known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\nCrohn’s Disease is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the rectum, although it may skip certain areas of the intestine, leaving some healthy, while other parts suffer. Ulcerative Colitis is a very similar disease in the IBD group of disorders, but it only affects the colon, affecting only the innermost lining of the colon. \nThe telltale symptoms of Crohn’s Disease:\n\nPersistent diarrhea\nRectal bleeding\nAbdominal pain and cramps\nConstipation\nUrgent need to move bowels\nSensation of incomplete evacuation or “rectal tenesmus” (Hey, you learned a new word!)\n\nOther signs that are associated with IBD:\n\nFever\nLoss of appetite\nWeight loss\nFatigue\nNight sweats\nLoss of menstrual cycle in women\n\nSounds terrible, doesn’t it? These are painful, life-altering disorders, which is why Crohn’s Disease and Colitis are specified as qualifying conditions for medical cannabis in nearly half of all medical marijuana states.\nThese symptoms can be controlled somewhat through diet, but often cannabis offers some of the best relief for the most severe symptoms – cramps, nausea, loss of appetite, etc.\nWithout further ado, in honor of Crohn’s Disease and Colitis Awareness Week, here are the top strains for your symptoms:\n 1. Jean Guy\nA fan favorite from our neighbors to the North (Canada, eh?), Jean Guy (pronounced “Jawn Gee”) is a sativa-dominant strain known for its high THC content and energizing effects. A great one to start your day cramp-free.\n 2. Hog\u0027s Breath\nHog’s Breath is a well-known indica with roots in the Kush landrace and is known for its potency against heavy pain and anxiety – a good strain to relax after a long work day.\n 3. Medicine Man\nMedicine Man lives up to its name by delivering potent pain relief with high levels of both THC and CBD. This medicinal strain is closely related to the master of the indica jungle – White Rhino.\n 4. Hash Plant\nHash Plant is known for an abundance of trichomes and a heavy body stone. This indica has a reputation for blissful euphoria, as well as easing pain and inflammation associated with Crohn’s and Colitis.\n 5. Willie Nelson\nWillie Nelson is named for the Red-Headed Stranger himself. This sativa offers a clear-headed, energetic high known to incite creativity, as well as a decent case of the munchies. \n 6. Chemo\nChemo is just as sedative as you might imagine – a heavy body high that’s perfect for chronic pain. Take note: the munchies are strong with this one. If you have stomach cramps or trouble eating, this strain will inspire your appetite.\n 7. Lemon Jack\nLemon Jack is born of the famed Jack Herer and Lemon Kush and offers strong psychoactive effects. Lemon Jack is a daytime strain as strong as a cup of coffee, but without the harsh stomach irritation. Recommended for users who suffer from fatigue.\n 8. Golden Pineapple\nGolden Pineapple is as delightful as it sounds. A hybrid cross that delivers uplifting, creative effects with a delicious fruity taste, it offers relief from stress and anxiety without causing fatigue.\n 9. Confidential Cheese\nConfidential Cheese is born of the legendary LA Confidential and Exodus Cheese. It offers powerful pain relief, as well as relief from insomnia. Great for winding down before bedtime, Confidential Cheese also subdues painful muscle spasms and cramps.\n 10. K2\nK2 is named for the world’s second highest mountain peak, which makes sense, as it comes from two of the greats – White Widow and Hindu Kush. K2 is known to increase appetite and calm nausea without any sedative sleepy effects, making it a great strain for both daytime and evening use.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12002927/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/top-10-strains-to-combat-crohns-and-colitis"}],"reviewCount":106,"flavors":[{"name":"Lemon","score":23.564150069476611},{"name":"Citrus","score":7.6655859194071319},{"name":"Earthy","score":4.90968040759611},{"name":"Sweet","score":4.5159796201945337},{"name":"Violet","score":2.9411764705882351}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":54.153157325922493},{"name":"Euphoric","score":49.83402809942875},{"name":"Relaxed","score":47.078122587617727},{"name":"Creative","score":45.90859966033657},{"name":"Uplifted","score":45.526478307858568}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":17.276516905974987},{"name":"Depression","score":10.213061602593793},{"name":"Headaches","score":8.24455766558592},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":7.8508568781843442},{"name":"Fatigue","score":6.8781843446039836}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":10.016211208893006},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":8.0477072718851321},{"name":"Migraines","score":6.0907827698008337},{"name":"PMS","score":3.7285780453913846},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":3.5317276516905971}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":40.998919252740457},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":5.6970819823992587},{"name":"Anxious","score":4.90968040759611},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.5748031496062991},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1.1811023622047243}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-jack_100x100_49ad.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1006230/b/lemon-jack__primary_88be.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-jack_100x100_14cd.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/618285/b/lemon-jack__primary_5628.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-jack_100x100_9a3c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/617648/b/lemon-jack__primary_9545.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-jack_100x100_ed9b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/605617/b/lemon-jack__primary_eb67.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-jack_100x100_cc17.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/592170/b/lemon-jack__primary_5e29.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/lemon-jack_100x100_2fed.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/580106/b/lemon-jack__primary_1339.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":32,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Bend, OR","Redmond, WA","Seattle, WA","Spokane Valley, WA","Anaheim, CA","Ann Arbor, MI","Astoria, OR","Beverly Hills, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-jack","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.36792452830189/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Jack Herer","subtitle":null,"slug":"jack-herer","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/jack-herer","symbol":"Jh","applink":"leafly://strain/jack-herer"},{"name":"Lemon Kush","subtitle":null,"slug":"lemon-kush","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-kush","symbol":"Lk","applink":"leafly://strain/lemon-kush"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
