            "text": "Lemon meringue has an amazing lemony citrus smell with a hint of diesel. Lots of crystals and orange hairs. It hits fairly smooth with a sort of creamy earthy aftertaste. It immediately helped soothe anxiety and nausea, and you can feel the pressure release behind the eyes. If I'm in a lot of discomfort from a migraine or nausea, when the relief comes, it's like a huge weight is lifted off me and I find myself finally relaxing. Just a quick little reboot before the more energizing and focused sativa effects kick in. Nice daytime strain. ",

Overall this is some great bud to smoke in the morning for that  \"pick me up\" kind of attitude.",
