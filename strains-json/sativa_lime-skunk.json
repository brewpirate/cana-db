Set goals beforehand, you will achieve them. Amateur users will assume they are not high because this is such a clear and functional stone - don't be fooled - Lime Skunk packs a late-inning confusing punch that will put that stoners grin on anyone's face at least for a moment...until you get it under control and get back to work, work, work.\n\nHot Tip - Only drink one coffee on the day you'll be using Lime Skunk. Too much coffee + too much Lime Skunk = Superduper Hipster Speedball.",
