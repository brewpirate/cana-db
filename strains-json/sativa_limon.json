That is the very best way I can describe this flower. I have had this in both flower and wax form - my review will reflect on the amalgamation of both methods.\n\nThe name is Limon, but that doesn\u0027t quite describe how it smells. It actually smells like someone chucked a barrel of limes into a barrel of diesel and let them absorb. It\u0027s pungent and tart. The smoke is heavy and cough inducing, and it hits hard off the bat.\n\nEffects are typical of sativas - energetic, focused, creative high, but you can feel a bit anxious if you overdo it.\n\nOverall, this is a solid flower if you want true sativa effects. This is a great morning high for patients experiencing depression, nausea, and malaise. Good for over pain thanks to being high in THC.\n\nNegative effects noticed is this strain does leave me with next day headaches.\n\nGood overall medicine.
