            "text": "EDM (short for electronic dance music) is often described as futuristic, grimy, technical, filthy, or heavy. Born in Europe in the 1990s, contemporary EDM encompasses a huge collection of sub-genres such as dubstep, riddim, techno, and trance\u2014just to name a few. Its primal emphasis on drums and heavy use of bass make it a physical experience as much as an auditory one. For this reason, some sub-genres have been described as \u201cfuture metal,\u201d due to a technical styling and heavy sound that inspire high-energy dance and emotional release.\n\nBelow, enjoy five excellent EDM albums with our recommended strains for a stimulating, cerebral, and emotional experience that will move with you from the inside out.\nMass Manipulation by Rezz\n(mau5trap Recordings)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Raspberry Kush\nMass Manipulation begins with a soothing, masculine voice urging you to focus on your breathing and allow hypnosis to loosen your entire body. \u201cRelax,\u201d the voice whispers before the music breaks and dives into dirty, technical dance beats. The result is an album that urges the listener to turn off their mind and feel their body with the upbeat, gritty music that tends to move it. The rest of Mass Manipulation follows a similar trajectory, expertly walking the line between meditative music and EDM. Rezz\u2019s thick, hypnotic, futuristic sound pulls you in like quicksand, gently tugging you along and reminding you not to struggle\u2014just relax.\nReflective Part 1 and Part 2 by Bassnectar\n(Amorphous Music)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Love Potion #1\nBassnectar has been releasing music for fourteen years and has steadily risen to the height of success in the EDM scene. Reflective is his latest, released in 2017. It reflects Bassnectar\u2019s penchant for effortless yet complex and structured music that keeps the listener engaged while immersing her in a futuristic musical journey. The bass-heavy album balances spacey, techy sounds with hard, grimy, bold breaks for a guttural feeling that demands movement (whether it be dance or head thrashing). Reflective won\u2019t disappoint as it builds a world around you and invites you deep, deep inside.\n\nDie Young EP by Kai Wachi\n(Kannibalen Records)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Supernatural\nThe Die Young EP may only have five songs total, but Kai Wachi\u2019s unique, distinctive sound and playful vibe makes it 20 minutes of solid, engaging EDM that will have you scouring his discography for more. Die Young isn\u2019t afraid to explore feelings and sounds spanning whimsical melodies to gritty drops that can be felt deep in your bones. The album makes use of a variety of instruments in addition to its eclectic electronic beats, creating a complexity that will keep listeners guessing in the best way possible.\nOpen the Vault by Ill-Esha\n(666590 Records DK)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Morning Glory\nOpen the Vault stands out with its lighthearted and spirited vibe. Ill-Esha\u2019s distinct style of musical fusion is in full force as she creates a soundscape that delves into floaty, fanciful melodies and metallic, technical beats. The cherry on top is Ill-Esha\u2019s own harmonic voice, as she sings atop certain tracks and reminds listeners of all the ways in which she stands out. Open the Vault\u2019s eclectic rhythms, deep bass, and captivating melodies are like a cool drink of water mixed with mind-altering punch.\n\nThere The Vultures Will Gather by Helicopter Showdown\n(Anemnesis)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Dutch Haze\nThere The Vultures Will Gather begins with a spacey, transcendental medley of music and distant voices before plunging suddenly and mercilessly into heavy, gritty beats. \u201cHelicopter Showdown\u201d manages to blend these two elements simultaneously, casting airy, tinkling melodies on top of filthy, bass-heavy breaks. The result makes There The Vultures Will Gather wild, bold music capable of whisking anyone into an intergalactic dance frenzy.",

            "text": "Compared to most other cocktails and mocktails, punches are easy-peasy \u2013 combine all ingredients, stir, chill, and serve. In lieu of extensive preparation, the best punches are simply made by layering complementary flavors, and terpene-laden cannabis adds one more element of both flavor and effect, augmenting the overall experience of classic fall punch drinks.\nThe following autumnal\u00a0drink recipes are adapted to accommodate the addition of cannabis tinctures. While any infused tincture you have on hand will do, we\u2019ve recommended a few specific strains whose terpenes amplify each elixir. If you don\u2019t have any tinctures handy, you can make your own, or check the menus of your favorite local dispensaries to find a place where you can pick one up.\n\nMix up a batch of one of the following, pop the pitcher in your fridge, and enjoy an extra-chill punch at your leisure. Cheers to fall!\nSparkling Sativa-Pear Punch\n\nThis pretty pink punch is ideal for the last few semi-sunny fall afternoons on the patio or porch. Whether you\u2019re expecting company or cozied up on your own, keep plenty on hand so you\u2019re ready whenever autumn calls for something to sip.\n\n2 parts pear nectar or pear juice\n2 parts Prosecco (make this a non-alcoholic punch with sparkling cider or lemon-lime soda)\n1 part cranberry juice\n10 mg-worth of cannabis tincture (suggested strains: sweet Candy Jack, tart Vortex, or floral Alice in Wonderland)\nGarnish: pear slice and/or freshly grated nutmeg\n\nAdapted from Sparking Pear-Prosecco Punch by Delish.\nCanna-Pome-Grapefruit Punch\n\nThis fruity pomegranate-grapefruit concoction marries your cannabis tincture with bright citrus notes and deep dark pomegranate colors and characteristics. It\u2019s bold, beautiful, and guaranteed to put a smile on your face.\n\n2 parts pomegranate juice\n1 part grapefruit vodka (try Deep Eddy, Smirnoff, or Absolut \u2013 or omit the alcohol by subbing in soda water)\n1 part fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice\n10 mg-worth of\u00a0cannabis tincture (suggested strains: fruit-punchy Dream Berry, grapefruit-orangey Citrix, or the descriptively-named Grapefruit)\nGarnish: pomegranate seeds or a grapefruit wheel\n\nAdapted from Pomegranate Grapefruit Punch by A Simple Pantry.\nAutumn Apple Indica Punch\n\nThis non-alcoholic apple punch is bona-fide fall in a glass: at once crisp, cool, juicy, and refreshing, it\u2019s ratcheted up a notch by the addition of an indica-infused tincture. What better way to melt seasonal stress away?\n\n3 parts apple cider\n2 parts cranberry juice\n1 part ginger beer\n10 mg-worth of\u00a0cannabis tincture (suggested strains: apple-vanilla Butter OG, honeyed Cream Caramel, or rich, sweet Love Potion #9)\nSqueeze of fresh lime juice\nGarnish: fresh cranberries and a cinnamon stick\n\nAdapted from Apple Orchard Punch by Allrecipes.\nNote: Always imbibe both cannabis and alcohol responsibly, and never drive after consuming either. When in doubt on the potency of your tincture, start with a small amount and work up \u2013 you can always add more, but you can\u2019t add less.",
