Rainier, and More","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1449882000000)\/","text":"Leafly\u0027s Explorer was just updated with some new strains! Is Harry Potter as magical as it sounds? Have you released the Kraken yet? And is Mt. Rainier as epic as the volcano it\u0027s named after? If you\u0027ve tried any of these, be sure to share your experiences with them in a strain review. Click the strain\u0027s name or tile to navigate to their description page where you can browse and leave reviews.\n \n   1. Harry Potter\n\nHarry Potter is an otherworldly hybrid strain that crosses Blissful Wizard with Fire Alien Kush. Bred by Sasquatch Gardens in California, Harry Potter casts a pacifying spell over the body, easing aches and pains while hushing anxiety.\n\n \n   2. Incredible Hulk\n\nIncredible Hulk is a sativa strain that harnesses the active and stimulating effects of its parent strains, Green Crack and Jack Herer. Creativity and social energy get a boost while blueberry, pineapple, and earthy flavors overwhelm the palate. This high-energy sativa is preferred as a daytime remedy for minor aches and pains.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Incredible Hulk\n \n   3. Alf \n\nThe indica-dominant hybrid Alf was created by crossing Animal Pie (an Animal Cookies and Cherry Pie hybrid) and Black Raven (White Fire Alien OG x ’09 Cookies) from The Captain’s Connection. With dessert-like notes of cookies and sour cherry, Alf’s aroma is as enticing as its purple crystal-coated buds. Patients seeking relief from pain, spasms, nausea, and appetite may want to give this relaxing hybrid a try.\n\n \n   4. Kraken\n\nKraken is a mythical strain of unknown parentage brought to us from Spanish breeder Buddha Seeds. Breeding with power and production in mind, this indica hybrid produces chunky, dense buds with a blanket of crystal resin. Producing big harvests and intensely euphoric effects, this monster of an indica lives up to its name.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Kraken\n \n   5. Mt. Rainier\n\nAs beautiful as the snowcapped mountain this strain was named after, the resinous Mt. Rainier hybrid was bred by RedEyed Genetics and hails from the Pacific Northwest. Northern Lights #5 meets White Lotus to create these frosty flowers that unleash scents of sweet citrus and fresh pine. This hybrid is great for daytime use, but don’t overdo it if you intend to stay functional and productive.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Mt. Rainier\n \n   6. Malakoff\n\nBred by Medical Seeds Co., Malakoff is an 80/20 sativa-dominant strain that crosses Strawberry Haze and White Widow.

It may also offer therapeutic qualities for those suffering from anxiety or depression. This strain flowers in about 70 to 75 days and can be harvested mid-October.\n\n \n   7. Snow Bud\n\nNamed after its snow-like resin and white pistils, Snow Bud by Dutch Passion is a hybrid that crosses Afghani and an unknown South African strain. With sweet cinnamon and sour skunk flavors, Snow Bud provides an uplifting and euphoric high. These mold and mildew-resistant plants do well indoors and flower in 7 to 8 weeks.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Snow Bud\n \nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week\u0027s newest additions!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12002213/new-strains-alert-kraken-harry-potter-incredible-hulk-mt-rainier.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-kraken-harry-potter-incredible-hulk-mt-rainier"}],"reviewCount":7,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":54.166666666666664},{"name":"Earthy","score":4.1666666666666661},{"name":"Woody","score":4.1666666666666661},{"name":"Tobacco","score":4.1666666666666661}],"effects":[{"name":"Focused","score":62.5},{"name":"Talkative","score":58.333333333333329},{"name":"Creative","score":58.333333333333329},{"name":"Energetic","score":58.333333333333329},{"name":"Happy","score":58.333333333333329}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":58.333333333333329},{"name":"Pain","score":54.166666666666664},{"name":"Depression","score":50},{"name":"Fatigue","score":50},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":4.1666666666666661}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":54.166666666666664},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":50}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":54.166666666666664},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":4.1666666666666661}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/malakoff_100x100_17f1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/508399/b/malakoff__primary_8095.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Caguas, Caguas, Puerto Rico"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/malakoff","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3.71428571428571/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Arjan\u0027s Strawberry Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"arjans-strawberry-haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/arjans-strawberry-haze","symbol":"Arj","applink":"leafly://strain/arjans-strawberry-haze"},{"name":"White Widow","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-widow","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow","symbol":"Ww","applink":"leafly://strain/white-widow"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":73,"outdoorFinish":"mid October","height":null,"averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
