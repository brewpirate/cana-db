            "text": "Born in 1960s Jamaica, reggae was an evolution of its predecessors: ska and rocksteady. The genre quickly took on a life of its own and eventually made its way to the United States, where it became a staple of 1960s culture. It also carved a special niche in the cannabis world, since reggae\u2019s penchant for political lyrics did not shy away from the topic of legalization.\n\nIt\u2019s a genre that is powerful in both its unique sound and inherently political roots. It is music that uplifts the spirit and rallies the heart.\u00a0The era of reggae produced a plethora of iconic artists such as Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, The Abyssinians, and Toots & The Maytals\u2014the latter of whom actually coined the term \u2018reggae\u2019 with the 1968 single, \u201cDo The Reggay.\u201d\nTo better understand and appreciate the genre, pack a pipe, grab your friends, and explore the soulful reggae music below\u2014each album we suggest is an ideal match for the right cannabis strain.\nStony Hill by Damian Marley\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: King\u2019s Bread\nYoungest son of the legendary Bob Marley, Damian Marley continues his father\u2019s legacy in reggae with his own fresh sound. Stony Hill is Marley\u2019s newest album\u2014released in July of this year, it combines modern electronic elements with classic reggae beats. Stony Hill feels like the next modern step in a continuously growing genre that refuses to lose its heart along the way.\nIn true reggae style, Marley\u2019s lyrics do not shy away from telling honest and human stories. From wondering what the future will bring on one track, while impeccable backup vocals chime \u201cbelieve in your dreams\u201d on another, the album explores the depth of human character.\nThis 18-track album also features the song \u201cMedication\u201d featuring Marley\u2019s brother and guest artist, Stephen Marley. The song is an ode to Marley\u2019s love of \u201cMary Jane\u201d and the medicinal power of cannabis. You\u2019ll be singing along to the lyrics, \u201cAnd I say to myself, what a wonderful herb.\u201d\n\nSevana EP by Sevana\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Purple Bud\nHailing from Kingston, Jamaica, Sevana burst onto the scene last year with her first EP album, where she delivers stunning, expert vocals and impactful reggae beats. The album begins with the softer ballad \u201cCarry You\u201d before launching into the groovy \u201cBit Too Shy,\u201d which sets the tone for the rest of the collection.\nThe EP\u2019s music will get you moving to the rhythm, while Sevana\u2019s energetic and heartfelt vocals delight across the soundscape with perfect control and beautiful clarity. Sevana captures the heart of reggae in her music, vocals, and lyrics for a complete immersion in classic reggae via a modern recording artist. Sevana\u2019s debut album proves she\u2019s an artist to watch and gives us high hopes of more great albums to come.\nEqual Rights by Peter Tosh\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Jah Kush\nAlong with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh got his start as part of The Wailers. Afterwards, he went on to become his own successful solo artist and produced many iconic albums, including\u00a0Equal Rights\u00a0in 1977.\nEqual Rights opens with the familiar song, \u201cGet Up, Stand Up,\u201d performed with Tosh\u2019s unique style and sound. The album contains classics such as \u201cDownpressor Man\u201d and \u201cStepping Razor,\u201d and features Tosh\u2019s punctuated and mellow vocals accompanied by melodies that are rich, vibrant, and smooth.\nAs a whole, Equal Rights is an iconic reggae album that encapsulates the heart and soul of reggae as it was at the time of its initial emergence onto the popular scene. For this reason, it will always reign as a powerful memento of reggae\u2019s roots.\n\nAfrican Holocaust by Steel Pulse\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Malawi\nReleased in 2004, African Holocaust\u00a0is the latest in a long line of albums produced by Steel Pulse. Though over a decade old, it remains relevant today both musically as well as lyrically, touching on topics such as global warming, corruption in government and religion, and the ramifications of slavery.\nFormed in 1975 in Birmingham, England, Steel Pulse has had a somewhat rotating cast of players over the years, but always with lead singer David Hinds at the forefront holding down vocals and rhythm guitar.\nAfrican Holocaust is no exception, with Hinds\u2019s fierce voice leading the upbeat reggae melodies that encourage dance and reflection all at once. It is this combination of poignant lyrics and stunningly composed music full of drums and horns that makes\u00a0African Holocaust such a noteworthy album.\nRebirth by Jimmy Cliff\n\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Lamb\u2019s Bread\nRebirth was released in 2012 as part of what Jimmy Cliff said was \u201ca rebirth of my career at this time.\u201d It was the first album Cliff had released in eight years, and went on to win a Grammy for Best Reggae Album. Cliff has been producing reggae music since the 1960s and is one of the few original artists who still produces new music today while touring or appearing at festivals (such as Lockn\u2019 in 2015).\nRebirth manages to encapsulate Cliff\u2019s classic reggae feel while shining anew with crisp, fresh, updated sounds. The 13-track album features new, original music as well as some covers\u2014all of it exceedingly lively, joyful, and brimming with energy.",

            "text": "I grew African Buzz (a special selection of Malawi Gold) and all I've got to say is... I really, really, really like this stuff. It grew easily. Had a mildew problem. This plant resisted better than any of the other strains growing. While flowering, the smell wasn't too strong, pretty easy to conceal if you just had one or two growing at home. It smelled like lemon Pledge and Bazooka Joe bubblegum... it's a weird combo, imagine smelling freshly cut lemongrass while chewing on that powdery pink gum you'd find in packs of hockey/baseball cards... that's very close. Not really my favourite smell but I can see how some would probably like this a lot. \n\nOverall, probably among the best weed I've smoked. No skunk/cat pee smell in here at all. Very easy smell to conceal if you'd have to try. Very sativa effect after about 10 minutes what feels like nothing. At first, you don't feel very high... but it guilds and builds. I feel pressure behind the eyes and a dry mouth. Energized but also relaxed (not sleepy). This stuff actually does a good job waking you up... like espresso coffee. I do feel my heart beating kinda faster but it isn't bad at all and it eases-up after another 10 minutes. No paranoia. This stuff always brings me to a wonderful place. Makes me feel so empathetic, happy, a little silly, playful and giggly. There is lots of euphoria in this high... feels like I could burst out laughing if someone would do something silly. This stuff will put a grin on your face and it will leave you functional... but I know I probably couldn't drive while on this. People around you will probably notice you are high when you're on this magical stuff. This weed doesn't make me hungry nor does it make me horny HOWEVER I just know that things like eating would feel good... so would listening to music... dancing would feel quite nice when on this. As for sex, this stuff makes me feel sensual rather than horny. Yeah... makes you want to have that \"tantric\" sort of sex. Generally speaking... this stuff accentuates pleasure, whatever that pleasure may be. \n\nOne thing I wish this didn't do so well is destroy short-term memory. It's a very \"having your keys in your hand while you're looking for them... all while forgetting what you were looking for in the first place\" kinda weed. Amazing!!!",

            "text": "I HAVE FOUND MY STRAIN! I consider Malawi not so much a recreational herb as My Spiritual Ally From the Plant Kingdom.\n\nMalawi is everything you hope cannabis will be. Music sounds good, food tastes great, your bodily senses come alive and ordinary routines like stretching, massaging your feet and washing your face feel AMAZING. At the same time, your mind sparkles with curiosity and clarity; my first time out I was able to absorb myself in a creative project that I had been putting off for a while because I just wasn\u2019t \u201cfeeling it,\u201d but which I now was able to connect with emotionally and aesthetically. \n\nMalawi takes you to a place of 100% honesty with yourself \u2014 a place where you can look at your life without fear, shame or wishful thinking, and see clearly what improvements can be made.  Malawi gives me the freedom of mind to dream big about my future, while at the same time giving me the clarity to plan, in zero-bullshit terms, how I can achieve those dreams. This is definitely a problem-solver\u2019s strain (and probably also great for playing games of strategy like chess or go, if that's your thing.)\n\nThe odor of this flower is wild, strong, earthy, mythic.  Definitely smells like something that would grow in Middle Earth, Wakanda or in the magical forest of Princess Mononoke. One whiff of it and you know your nose is plugging directly into some serious Ancient Vegetable Intelligence. \n\nA very smooth, pleasant launch. While some strains might make you feel like you\u2019ve been shot out of a cannon, Malawi lifts you up gently. After vaping a tiny amount, I felt like I was taking off in a solar-powered glider, easing out onto warm thermal updrafts lofting me up into a wide and welcoming blue sky. \n\nShortly thereafter I had a vision of a female pixie - who looked like young BernNadette Stanis, (the actor who played Thelma on the 70s sitcom Good Times, whom as a kid I had a celebrity crush on) dressed in an amazing green furry faery costume, fluttering around me on emerald green butterfly wings, urging me to smile and relax. And I certainly did! I was suffused with a sense of warm, happy arousal which, as a person living with Depression, I feel rarely, and was most welcome.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a hippie cliche: I live in an apartment overlooking a park, and at a certain point around sunset I looked out at all the people jogging, strolling, walking their dogs, and I felt a crazy Walt Whitman-esque love for EVERYBODY. Cynics may snort at this, but if you\u2019ve been there, you know what I\u2019m talking about. The human brain contains many programs, and one of those programs is a feeling of familial love for ALL your fellow humans. You don\u2019t need cannabis to launch this program, but if you\u2019re stuck in day-to-day stress loops, it certainly helps.\n\nNegatives: Cottonmouth comes on strong, so have some water or a tasty beverage close at hand. Your balance will be off so don\u2019t try riding a bicycle or \u201cbouldering\u201d at the rock climbing gym. \n\nIncredibly, this was $10 a gram (the lowest price point) at my local dispensary. I purchased a few other \u201ctop shelf\u201d strains (Golden Goat, Holy Grail) for more than double the price, but they did not compare to this humble yet mighty Malawi. Apparently it\u2019s not an easy flower to keep in stock, so if your local dispensary has it, do yourself a favor and snatch some up!",
