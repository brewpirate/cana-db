After a bowl, immediately feeling very significant pain relief (was in a car accident recently, nerves damage in back/neck) - however, extremely lazy and sleepy. The pain relief benefits and buzz are extraordinary and this strain lasts for a loooooong time. The real downsides are the sedation, I personally prefer buds that provide pain relief while still keeping me energetic and awake. Overall a 7/10.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1620960,"username":"spookygeorge","text":"This is my go-to for when I go to class, and want to participate in class discussions.
