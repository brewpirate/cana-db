            "text": "Following the lunar calendar, the 2017 Chinese New Year (also known as the Spring Festival) falls on January 28th. This year rings in the Year of the Fire Rooster (whose last appearance on the Chinese calendar dated back to 1957) and will be accompanied by two weeks of celebration flanked by firework shows and traditional lion dancing.\nThose born under the\u00a0fire rooster are thought\u00a0to exude an attitude of trustworthiness and responsibility while maintaining the rooster\u2019s other positive traits: activeness, popularity, honesty, and loyalty.\nTo join in the celebrations of this Chinese New Year, we decided to pair a few strains that exude the fire rooster\u2019s best qualities.\nMango Haze\n\nSativa Mango Haze packs a fruity punch with its cerebral buzz and mango flavor. Its uplifting qualities speak directly to the fire rooster\u2019s \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cpopular\u201d traits.\nPermafrost\n\nIf this January chill has you turning blue, give the hybrid Permafrost a try. Despite the name, its only frosty elements come from its coat of crystal trichomes. Ease into this this strain for a relaxing body high that will set a joyous mood.\nSage N Sour\n\nSage is a popular \u201clife-giving\u201d herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, so there\u2019s no wonder why the sativa Sage N Sour made a spot on this list. Ring in the new year with a balance of euphoria and energy as you steep in this aromatic strain.\nFlowerbomb Kush\n\nThe indica Flowerbomb Kush won\u2019t knock you out before celebrations are over. It\u2019s \u201cinvigorating cerebral effects\u201d balance out a floaty body high that will cruise you through the Chinese New Year\u2019s two weeks of festivities.\nPeaches and Cream\n\nAdd a little sweetness to your celebrations with the delicious hybrid Peaches and Cream. Possessing a \u201cheady euphoria,\u201d this strain will keep you going through\u00a0glowing nights full of fireworks.",

            "text": "CBD cannabis strains are hitting the market so fast, it\u2019s impossible to keep track of them all. The list below will familiarize you with the most common CBD varieties, but keep in mind that your dispensary probably stocks many others. If these popular strains aren\u2019t in stock or you\u2019d like to try something new, ask your budtender to point out other standout CBD strains and products.\nWhat is CBD, you might ask? CBD stands for cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating cannabis constituent with a variety of\u00a0studied\u00a0benefits such as:\n\nPain relief\nAnti-inflammatory\nAnti-epileptic\nAnti-anxiety\n\n\nA strain can be high in THC, CBD, or a combination of the two. Both compounds have unique medicinal properties, some of which are amplified when both compounds are present (e.g. pain management). High-CBD or mixed strains tend to be the best choices for consumers prone to anxiety. But ultimately, you\u2019ll be the one to decide which strain works best for you.\nNote that these strains tend to express consistent THC:CBD profiles, but you may encounter variations (e.g. ACDC may be found with little to no THC, or exhibit a balanced THC:CBD ratio). Always check each product\u2019s tested cannabinoid profile to be certain of its THC and CBD levels.\nTo see if one of the below CBD strains is available nearby, click the strain tile and scroll down to its Finder map.\nCommon High-CBD/Low-THC Strains\nPopular Uses: Epilepsy, severe anxiety, inflammation, fatigue\n\nCommon Mixed THC/CBD Strains\nPopular Uses: Pain, mild anxiety, insomnia, inflammation\n\nYou can search Leafly\u2019s strain database for more CBD strains, or contact your local dispensary to explore more options near you.",

Nice tingly indica undertone, barely noticeable which I prefer if any indica is present. Watch out when you sit down though, she can take you away to dream land if you let your mind escape, depending on what you want of course! As a recreational smoker, this strain is truly fun and beautiful with no noticeable negatives. Made it's way into my top 10! Oh and taste is exquisite mango and sweet is definitely prominent, I'll have to smoke a bit more to explore the tastes fully I focus on the high first. Happy smoking, legalise UK.",
