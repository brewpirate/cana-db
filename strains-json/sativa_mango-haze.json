This year rings in the Year of the Fire Rooster (whose last appearance on the Chinese calendar dated back to 1957) and will be accompanied by two weeks of celebration flanked by firework shows and traditional lion dancing.\nThose born under the fire rooster are thought to exude an attitude of trustworthiness and responsibility while maintaining the rooster’s other positive traits: activeness, popularity, honesty, and loyalty.\nTo join in the celebrations of this Chinese New Year, we decided to pair a few strains that exude the fire rooster’s best qualities.\nMango Haze\n\nSativa Mango Haze packs a fruity punch with its cerebral buzz and mango flavor. Its uplifting qualities speak directly to the fire rooster’s “active” and “popular” traits.\nPermafrost\n\nIf this January chill has you turning blue, give the hybrid Permafrost a try. Despite the name, its only frosty elements come from its coat of crystal trichomes. Ease into this this strain for a relaxing body high that will set a joyous mood.\nSage N Sour\n\nSage is a popular “life-giving” herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, so there’s no wonder why the sativa Sage N Sour made a spot on this list. Ring in the new year with a balance of euphoria and energy as you steep in this aromatic strain.\nFlowerbomb Kush\n\nThe indica Flowerbomb Kush won’t knock you out before celebrations are over. It’s “invigorating cerebral effects” balance out a floaty body high that will cruise you through the Chinese New Year’s two weeks of festivities.\nPeaches and Cream\n\nAdd a little sweetness to your celebrations with the delicious hybrid Peaches and Cream. Possessing a “heady euphoria,” this strain will keep you going through glowing nights full of fireworks.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/27164926/chinese-new-year.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/strains-to-celebrate-chinese-new-year"},{"id":"contentitems-3607","title":"Which Cannabis Strains Are High in CBD?","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1438790400000)\/","text":"CBD cannabis strains are hitting the market so fast, it’s impossible to keep track of them all. The list below will familiarize you with the most common CBD varieties, but keep in mind that your dispensary probably stocks many others. If these popular strains aren’t in stock or you’d like to try something new, ask your budtender to point out other standout CBD strains and products.\nWhat is CBD, you might ask? CBD stands for cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating cannabis constituent with a variety of studied benefits such as:\n\nPain relief\nAnti-inflammatory\nAnti-epileptic\nAnti-anxiety\n\n\nA strain can be high in THC, CBD, or a combination of the two. Both compounds have unique medicinal properties, some of which are amplified when both compounds are present (e.g. pain management). High-CBD or mixed strains tend to be the best choices for consumers prone to anxiety. But ultimately, you’ll be the one to decide which strain works best for you.\nNote that these strains tend to express consistent THC:CBD profiles, but you may encounter variations (e.g. ACDC may be found with little to no THC, or exhibit a balanced THC:CBD ratio). Always check each product’s tested cannabinoid profile to be certain of its THC and CBD levels.\nTo see if one of the below CBD strains is available nearby, click the strain tile and scroll down to its Finder map.\nCommon High-CBD/Low-THC Strains\nPopular Uses: Epilepsy, severe anxiety, inflammation, fatigue\n\nCommon Mixed THC/CBD Strains\nPopular Uses: Pain, mild anxiety, insomnia, inflammation\n\nYou can search Leafly’s strain database for more CBD strains, or contact your local dispensary to explore more options near you.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14155434/which-cannabis-strains-high-in-CBD.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/what-cannabis-strains-are-high-in-cbd"}],"reviewCount":204,"flavors":[{"name":"Mango","score":64.07924227073164},{"name":"Tropical","score":41.751481379140948},{"name":"Sweet","score":36.484909889165209},{"name":"Citrus","score":19.422569156611711},{"name":"Earthy","score":8.40433207454484}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":56.378757176629513},{"name":"Happy","score":53.942540910626015},{"name":"Relaxed","score":53.312379110251449},{"name":"Euphoric","score":51.492124896380219},{"name":"Energetic","score":51.168217125663936}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":42.383945841392652},{"name":"Depression","score":37.29736575481256},{"name":"Pain","score":28.96441619845875},{"name":"Fatigue","score":22.688895029320562},{"name":"Headaches","score":14.735884682693193}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":29.849405913235703},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":9.8469497405667621},{"name":"PTSD","score":8.963111356728378},{"name":"Migraines","score":6.9617144085229192},{"name":"Asthma","score":6.3304012772097877}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":45.630315311166378},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":18.684949801971079},{"name":"Dizzy","score":13.04074176414602},{"name":"Anxious","score":8.279220779220779},{"name":"Paranoid","score":7.6479076479076475}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":4,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango-haze_100x100_1625.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/636306/b/mango-haze__primary_8273.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango-haze_100x100_6446.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/636426/b/mango-haze__primary_57a2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango-haze_100x100_8bab.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/587594/b/mango-haze__primary_0dda.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango-haze_100x100_3359.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/524041/b/mango-haze__primary_4efe.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango-haze_100x100_e977.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/522815/b/mango-haze__primary_41f7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mango-haze_100x100_3408.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/515820/b/mango-haze__primary_bcbd.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":25,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Vancouver, BC","Portland, OR","Los Angeles, CA","Montréal, QC","Denver, CO","Calgary, AB","Edmonton, AB","Eugene, OR","Everett, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/mango-haze","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.51470588235294/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Northern Lights #5","subtitle":null,"slug":"northern-lights--5","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights--5","symbol":"N5","applink":"leafly://strain/northern-lights--5"},{"name":"Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/haze","symbol":"H","applink":"leafly://strain/haze"},{"name":"Skunk #1","subtitle":null,"slug":"skunk-1","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1","symbol":"Sk1","applink":"leafly://strain/skunk-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":66,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
