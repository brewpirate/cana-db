Light green with some of the most amazing pistils I’ve ever seen.  Hairs are long, mustard/creamsicle colored, and upon further review through a microscope, decked out with amber trichs.  Sugary as all hell, a gorgeous representation of the strain.\r\n\r\nSmell: Skunk comes through heavy in the smell, lots of Haze notes too.  Really just sweet, piney skunkiness with a dankitude that’ll leave you stinking in the streets. \r\n\r\nTaste: Just like it smells.  The likeness is uncanny and delicious, and will linger for minutes as you keep salivating.  Took a few hits from the 5 footer and it was like getting punched in the face by an evergreen wearing lemon cologne.\r\n\r\nBuzz Type: Good, but not quite classic MTF potency.  The one caveat I have about the bud is the strength; it’s a remarkable, uplifting high that conjures memories of Durban and LSD strains.  \r\n","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1642005,"username":"Evan360","text":"I bought a 1g cartridge of MTF made by Green Haven LLC (good stuff btw). \n\nAt first, without knowing any specifics of this strain, I was expecting an Alaskan Thunder Fuck type of smell, taste and high.

The celebration was sponsored by Leafly and showcased some of the region’s best cannabis flower, concentrates, edibles, topicals, glass artists, and accessories. Even a last-minute venue change couldn’t stop the stream of cannabis lovers from overflowing the state fair-themed event that came complete with infused cotton candy, a mechanical joint to ride, magicians, performers, artists, and more. Honestly, the only thing missing was a medicated corn dog to combat my munchies.\nAs expected, the dab bar was the hive that everyone was buzzing around, with a variety of solvent and solventless concentrates to sample from some of the best extract artists in the area. The highlight had to be local artist Scott Deppe’s crystal skull piece that sat at the X-Tracted bar and captured every passer-by with its intricate design and whopping 6-figure price tag. Those who weren’t concentrated around the dab rigs were busy sampling edibles, entering raffles, and relaxing with a massage at one the topical company booths.\n\nA judge’s pass to the event allowed visitors to join the action by sampling each of the strains entered into the People\u0027s Choice category of the Cup. For $99, the judge’s pass gave ticket-holders a half gram sample of all 10 anonymous strains and the opportunity to vote for their favorite. The mystery strains all had amazing flavors, ranging from sweet and tropical to earthy and piney, which made it all the more difficult to choose a favorite.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the
