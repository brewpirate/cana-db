            "text": "Received 2 g of this at a local dispensary as a freebie with purchase. I rarely dabble with Sativas but the name sold me and plus it looked Amazing! Dark lime green  flowers absolutely covered in white crystals. It smelled like skunky lemon wafers to me. I took a few bong rips on a rainy afternoon and 5 minutes later, I felt very anxious and was honestly thinking it had been laced with something. It was so Speedy, I couldn't be still, was trying to organize everything, I took a long cold shower Hahaha, after about 30 minutes it evened out and I went for a walk in the rain and felt just amazing, I felt like everything everywhere would just be alright paired with considerable munchies. \n\nI gave it only 3 stars as I am prone to anxiety with large doses but the initial onset was a bit too jarring for me, if that's your thing great, but for people that easily get anxious/paranoid it's unsettling. Would recommend for enjoying nature not urban environments.",

            "text": "Enjoy smoking it and made cannabutter that is absolutely knock your socks off good.\n\nSmoking it; uplifting, clears my mind, picks me up and gives me some energy.  Makes me smile and feel like dancing. It doesn't take a lot to start feeling it. I try to take it easy as I've read that it can kick start anxiety a little, but I haven't experienced it myself. \n\nThis strain is most def savoury. The flavours are good for smoking and for eating. You must like the flavour if you use Megalodon in weed infused edibles. It's pretty distinct.\n\nI used 1/2 oz of Megalodon with a pound of butter. Slow cooked for 20 hours. Wow! Wow! Wow! 1 tsp of butter is plenty for having a good time.  Made brownies with the cannabutter as well. \n\nMade grilled cheese sandwiches with the butter. It was a complete and utter giggle fest. \n\nSingle bite size brownie is good for new user in the evening. Ends with you ready to get a good night sleep.\n\nTwo brownies great for unwinding mid evening, giggling a little and then enjoying a little couch lock before a great night sleep.\n\nThree to Four brownies and you're having lots of fun.\n\nThis strain gets a 4 thumbs up for making me happy, creative and topping the evening off with some relaxtion and a dreamy drift off to dreamland. \n\nBetter to start with a little and work your way up.",
