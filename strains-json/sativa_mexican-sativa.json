            "text": "If you\u2019re like any other human on the planet, you\u2019ve most likely\u00a0fallen in love with avocado toast\u2014a food trend that blew up in the past few years due to its ease, delectable taste, and photogenic qualities. This Instagram favorite is\u00a0even the theme of a new and unique\u00a0restaurant in Brooklyn. We love avocado toast too, so we thought it\u2019d be a good idea to play around with an avocado toast recipe of our own. Infused, of course.\nThe three main ingredients you\u2019ll need are your bread of choice, a ripe avocado or two, and some infused cannabutter. However, it\u2019s easy to add an\u00a0extra kick of flavor to come up with\u00a0a delicious and flavorful twist.\u00a0This recipe was inspired\u00a0by How Sweet It Is\u00a0and is sure to get your taste buds tingling\u2014all you\u2019re missing\u00a0is a frosty margarita on the side. We recommend pairing this recipe with\u00a0Mexican Sativa.\nHave your own favorite version of avocado toast? Tell us about it in the comments below!\n\nSpicy Infused\u00a0Avocado Toast\nStart to finish:\u00a030 minutes\nYields:\u00a04 servings\n\u00a0Approximate Dosage: 25 milligrams per serving*\nGrilled Corn Ingredients\n\n2 ears sweet corn\n1 tablespoon\u00a0extra-virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons Mexican Sativa cannabutter\n1\u20444 teaspoon cayenne pepper\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nToast Ingredients\n\n2 avocados\n1\u20444 teaspoon salt\n1\u20444 teaspoon pepper\n1\u20442\u00a0lime, sliced\n4 thick slices\u00a0whole grain bread\n1\u20443\u00a0cup queso fresco cheese,\u00a0crumbled\n1 tablespoon\u00a0cilantro, finely chopped\n4 tablespoons fresh pico de gallo\n\n\nDirections\n\nRub corn ears with olive oil and grill until the corn is charred. Remember to turn the corn periodically for\u00a0consistency. Remove from grill and let cool before cutting corn kernels off of the ear and placing in a bowl.\nMix\u00a0spices and butter together, then add butter mixture to the corn. Stir well and let\u00a0the butter soak into the corn for a few minutes to let the seasonings stick.\nIn a separate bowl, mash the avocado, salt, pepper, and juice of one lime wedge together.\nToast your toast.\nSpread the avocado mash on toast and top with as much grilled corn and crumbled queso fresco as your heart desires.\nSprinkle cilantro and another dash of lime juice on top, then add a good spoonful of fresh pico de gallo.\nEnjoy!\n\n*Note: The amount of infused butter specified in this recipe is a very loose suggestion; the actual amount you use should be modified based on the strength of your butter and the potency you desire. Dosing homemade edibles can be tricky (click here\u00a0to learn why), so the best way to test for potency is to start with one portion of a serving, wait one to two hours, then make an informed decision on whether to consume more. Always dose carefully and listen to your body, and never drive under the influence of cannabis.",

            "text": "Sativa strains have long flourished in Mexico\u2019s hot climate, and these heirlooms have since propagated countless hybrids with their genetics. Here are just six of those descendants. To find out if they\u2019re available at a nearby shop, simply click the strain tile to navigate to its strain page and check its \u201cAvailability\u201d tab.\nAcapulco Gold\n\u00a0\nSaid to have originated in Acapulco, Mexico, this sativa is a colorful tangle of gold-orange pistils. With a sweet fruity flavor counterbalanced by earthy and spicy notes, Acapulco Gold provides a high-energy cerebral buzz that keeps you feeling stimulated throughout the day\u2019s festivities.\nMexican Sativa\n\u00a0\nThe breeders at Sensi Seeds managed to hunt down a sativa from Oaxaca and cross it with a Pakistani indica and the high-energy African sativa Durban Poison. The result was Mexican Sativa, a robustly uplifting strain with a fresh aroma of sandalwood and pine. The strong cerebral euphoria can verge on too trippy for some, but get to your happy place (at home, out for a hike, a grassy spot in the sun) and you\u2019re more likely to experience the rich sensory experience this sativa has to offer.\nCannalope Haze\n\u00a0\nCannalope Haze descends from Haze and a landrace strain from Mexico.\u00a0Cherished for its weightless euphoria and tropical flavors, it\u2019s the perfect strain for staying social and giggling. With aromas of sweet melon and wildflowers, Cannalope Haze is perfect for pairing with fresh fruits and floral cocktails.\nTrainwreck\n\u00a0\nThis hybrid mutt descends from Mexican and Thai sativas as well as Afghani indicas, creating a well-balanced experience that relaxes the body while lifting the mood. High in the citrusy terpene limonene, Trainwreck carries a pronounced lemon aroma with woody, earthy overtones. For those susceptible to social anxiety, this strain might be a better choice than the heady, racy sativas on this list.\nHaze\n\u00a0\nMaybe you\u2019ve never tried the original Haze, but if you\u2019re a fan of sativa strains, you\u2019re likely to have tried one of its hybrid progeny. Developed in the 1960s as a result of crossing Mexican, Thai, Colombian, and South Indian varieties, Haze has since become a cornerstone of sativa breeding. Spicy in flavor and energizing in effect, it\u2019s not hard to see why Haze belongs in your stash jar.\nNYPD\n\u00a0\nThough in no way Mexican by name, Nirvana Seeds\u2019 NYPD descends from a Mexican landrace strain known as \u201cEldorado\u201d and Aurora Indica. Funky diesel flavors are made sweet with dominant flavors of sweet lemon, and this sativa-dominant strain is known to provide a cerebral rush to keep your mind humming alive throughout the day\u2019s celebrations.",

It was dirt cheap and good and lasted a long time. As the season wore on, it got crappy and seedy and then it would dry up, then in Oct, it would start all over again. It gets you pretty ripped, and if you've been on other strains and come back to it, you get annihilated. It's just a different animal all together. I've always liked it. ",
