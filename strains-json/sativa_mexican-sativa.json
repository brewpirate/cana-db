This Instagram favorite is even the theme of a new and unique restaurant in Brooklyn. We love avocado toast too, so we thought it’d be a good idea to play around with an avocado toast recipe of our own. Infused, of course.\nThe three main ingredients you’ll need are your bread of choice, a ripe avocado or two, and some infused cannabutter. However, it’s easy to add an extra kick of flavor to come up with a delicious and flavorful twist. This recipe was inspired by How Sweet It Is and is sure to get your taste buds tingling—all you’re missing is a frosty margarita on the side. We recommend pairing this recipe with Mexican Sativa.\nHave your own favorite version of avocado toast? Tell us about it in the comments below!\n\nSpicy Infused Avocado Toast\nStart to finish: 30 minutes\nYields: 4 servings\n Approximate Dosage: 25 milligrams per serving*\nGrilled Corn Ingredients\n\n2 ears sweet corn\n1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons Mexican Sativa cannabutter\n1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nToast Ingredients\n\n2 avocados\n1⁄4 teaspoon salt\n1⁄4 teaspoon pepper\n1⁄2 lime, sliced\n4 thick slices whole grain bread\n1⁄3 cup queso fresco cheese, crumbled\n1 tablespoon cilantro, finely chopped\n4 tablespoons fresh pico de gallo\n\n\nDirections\n\nRub corn ears with olive oil and grill until the corn is charred. Remember to turn the corn periodically for consistency. Remove from grill and let cool before cutting corn kernels off of the ear and placing in a bowl.\nMix spices and butter together, then add butter mixture to the corn. Stir well and let the butter soak into the corn for a few minutes to let the seasonings stick.\nIn a separate bowl, mash the avocado, salt, pepper, and juice of one lime wedge together.\nToast your toast.\nSpread the avocado mash on toast and top with as much grilled corn and crumbled queso fresco as your heart desires.\nSprinkle cilantro and another dash of lime juice on top, then add a good spoonful of fresh pico de gallo.\nEnjoy!\n\n*Note: The amount of infused butter specified in this recipe is a very loose suggestion; the actual amount you use should be modified based on the strength of your butter and the potency you desire. Dosing homemade edibles can be tricky (click here to learn why), so the best way to test for potency is to start with one portion of a serving, wait one to two hours, then make an informed decision on whether to consume more. Always dose carefully and listen to your body, and never drive under the influence of cannabis.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/03093140/avocado-toast.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/marijuana-avocado-toast-recipe"},{"id":"contentitems-2989","title":"6 Cannabis Strains With Mexican Heritage","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1462467600000)\/","text":"Sativa strains have long flourished in Mexico’s hot climate, and these heirlooms have since propagated countless hybrids with their genetics. Here are just six of those descendants. To find out if they’re available at a nearby shop, simply click the strain tile to navigate to its strain page and check its “Availability” tab.\nAcapulco Gold\n \nSaid to have originated in Acapulco, Mexico, this sativa is a colorful tangle of gold-orange pistils. With a sweet fruity flavor counterbalanced by earthy and spicy notes, Acapulco Gold provides a high-energy cerebral buzz that keeps you feeling stimulated throughout the day’s festivities.\nMexican Sativa\n \nThe breeders at Sensi Seeds managed to hunt down a sativa from Oaxaca and cross it with a Pakistani indica and the high-energy African sativa Durban Poison. The result was Mexican Sativa, a robustly uplifting strain with a fresh aroma of sandalwood and pine. The strong cerebral euphoria can verge on too trippy for some, but get to your happy place (at home, out for a hike, a grassy spot in the sun) and you’re more likely to experience the rich sensory experience this sativa has to offer.\nCannalope Haze\n \nCannalope Haze descends from Haze and a landrace strain from Mexico. Cherished for its weightless euphoria and tropical flavors, it’s the perfect strain for staying social and giggling. With aromas of sweet melon and wildflowers, Cannalope Haze is perfect for pairing with fresh fruits and floral cocktails.\nTrainwreck\n \nThis hybrid mutt descends from Mexican and Thai sativas as well as Afghani indicas, creating a well-balanced experience that relaxes the body while lifting the mood. High in the citrusy terpene limonene, Trainwreck carries a pronounced lemon aroma with woody, earthy overtones. For those susceptible to social anxiety, this strain might be a better choice than the heady, racy sativas on this list.\nHaze\n \nMaybe you’ve never tried the original Haze, but if you’re a fan of sativa strains, you’re likely to have tried one of its hybrid progeny. Developed in the 1960s as a result of crossing Mexican, Thai, Colombian, and South Indian varieties, Haze has since become a cornerstone of sativa breeding. Spicy in flavor and energizing in effect, it’s not hard to see why Haze belongs in your stash jar.\nNYPD\n \nThough in no way Mexican by name, Nirvana Seeds’ NYPD descends from a Mexican landrace strain known as “Eldorado” and Aurora Indica. Funky diesel flavors are made sweet with dominant flavors of sweet lemon, and this sativa-dominant strain is known to provide a cerebral rush to keep your mind humming alive throughout the day’s celebrations.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/05085503/mexico.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/6-cannabis-strains-with-mexican-heritage"}],"reviewCount":44,"flavors":[{"name":"Woody","score":40.131578947368418},{"name":"Earthy","score":16.44736842105263},{"name":"Pine","score":14.254385964912281},{"name":"Pungent","score":12.93859649122807},{"name":"Nutty","score":12.93859649122807}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":94.956140350877192},{"name":"Energetic","score":94.078947368421055},{"name":"Euphoric","score":84.649122807017548},{"name":"Giggly","score":66.008771929824562},{"name":"Tingly","score":52.631578947368418}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":19.517543859649123},{"name":"Depression","score":18.201754385964911},{"name":"Pain","score":16.44736842105263},{"name":"Fatigue","score":15.131578947368421},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":14.254385964912281}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":18.201754385964911},{"name":"Migraines","score":14.692982456140351},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":12.5},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Disorder","score":12.5},{"name":"Hypertension","score":12.5}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":79.824561403508767},{"name":"Paranoid","score":53.94736842105263},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":45.39473684210526},{"name":"Dizzy","score":27.631578947368421},{"name":"Headache","score":17.763157894736842}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mexican-sativa_100x100_9f67.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/591286/b/mexican-sativa__primary_9e2b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mexican-sativa_100x100_c71c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/515023/b/mexican-sativa__primary_2d25.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mexican-sativa_100x100_1eb5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/483626/b/mexican-sativa__primary_b59d.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mexican-sativa_100x100_f5d8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/464345/b/mexican-sativa__primary_0391.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mexican-sativa_100x100_20cc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/389793/b/mexican-sativa__primary_8c4a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/mexican-sativa_100x100_062d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/384471/b/mexican-sativa__primary_3037.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":22,"popularCities":["Detroit, MI","Las Vegas, NV","Shasta Lake, CA","Shelton, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/mexican-sativa","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3.36363636363636/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Mexican","subtitle":null,"slug":"mexican","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/mexican","symbol":"Mex","applink":"leafly://strain/mexican"},{"name":"Durban Poison","subtitle":null,"slug":"durban-poison","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/durban-poison","symbol":"Dp","applink":"leafly://strain/durban-poison"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":"Easy","preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":"Medium","environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
