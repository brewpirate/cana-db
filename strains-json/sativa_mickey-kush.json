Chills out the head like fresh snow. Very relaxing, but bright eyed and awake. Both mentally and physically soothing. Like you‚Äôre floating absently in tropical waters. Heads got a slight buzziness - like there‚Äôs a strap from the chin, around the cheeks, to the top of the head. Vision is explosive, compelling, and the most fun to get lost in. Nature is very psychedelic - highly recommend for being outside and seeing a lot. Hikes, road trips, or even errands. It feels confident and capable enough to manage 90% of tasks while still being hella dissociative. Mood is so uplifted with euphoria bursting from the chest and an adventuresome, gleeful spirit. Eyes are a bit droopy though, but cottonmouth isn‚Äôt terrible. Music is entrancing and deeply felt. Cuts through very cleanly as you ride along super tripped out.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/kZ3iwRmPT5O6arIA05kqrPWjazc=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net%2fdZCCCxYREQnXfPfK6mXSTpqotAY%3d%2f120x120%2fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3.amazonaws.com%252Fleafly%252Fbin%252FGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1625378,"username":"MysticalToker222","text":"Fantastic strain for anyone suffering from bipolar disorder or depression!
