Like you\u2019re floating absently in tropical waters. Heads got a slight buzziness - like there\u2019s a strap from the chin, around the cheeks, to the top of the head. Vision is explosive, compelling, and the most fun to get lost in. Nature is very psychedelic - highly recommend for being outside and seeing a lot. Hikes, road trips, or even errands. It feels confident and capable enough to manage 90% of tasks while still being hella dissociative. Mood is so uplifted with euphoria bursting from the chest and an adventuresome, gleeful spirit. Eyes are a bit droopy though, but cottonmouth isn\u2019t terrible. Music is entrancing and deeply felt. Cuts through very cleanly as you ride along super tripped out.",
