It takes the best of both parent strains, and combines them into an even stronger effect and resin production. This strain routinely tests above 20% THC, and has an incredible terpene profile to back up its potency. Users beware that this strain will leave you with a euphoric and bubbly pick me up that is sure to turn any frown upside down.",
