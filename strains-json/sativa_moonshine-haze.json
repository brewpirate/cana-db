I just purchased a G of concentrated oil, and consumed it all orally (as directed), I suffer from severe IBS, and the budtender (hold\u0027s a bachelor\u0027s in plant science/physiology) said that if I could tolerate the dose in my head; that I would be so pleased for weeks with the results. Apparently this method is high in CBG VERY HIGH, and as a heavy medical user (about 3.5gs a day) I knew I was down.As promised I am having an amazing time! In my head everything is bubbly like a ballon and I\u0027m floating, it\u0027s a very detached feeling, but my body is so calm, indica\u0027s don\u0027t do this to me. This is an uplifting sativa for sure, and the CBG\u0027s will be around my GI for weeks in this dose (similiar to how THC lingers in those pesky drug tests) cannabis is not a drug, but cannabinoids ARE and THC and CBG for me are miracles :)","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/ZtQxS6XT_MjOwMadRkRsU9ZNU-I=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fX2q7eTOS7WxMAnwrLSBM_wide-brim-green.png"},{"id":1628255,"username":"HybridNoisebloom","text":"Tastes and feels great as hell. On top of that it kicks in so quick that I don\u0027t have much time to react. About maybe 30 seconds max before it slams into me. It feels like it lasts for ages because of that too. For the first hour to hour and a half it feels real psychedelic and makes it easy to do things or even be active. And then over the next few hours it relaxes and lets me feel even more stress-free and better, especially with stuff where I need to talk to people. If you smoke too much it doesn\u0027t absolutely wreck you (and if it does, even then maybe for only ten minutes at most in my experience). Even though I vastly prefer and need indicas, this is one of, if not my favorite sativa(s) ever.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/U9D6jRktbp0tD6kTLBLje6iBugM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net%2f4aMMaTf4eqcYvcOQcRejbsRjdIk%3d%2f120x120%2fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Fleafly-images%252Fuser-profile%252FKoThq07WS0GFpjLzLOmF_Dango.(CLANNAD).full.113863.jpg.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":105,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":46.916666666666664},{"name":"Sweet","score":30.333333333333332},{"name":"Flowery","score":30.083333333333332},{"name":"Woody","score":28.916666666666668},{"name":"Pungent","score":15.166666666666666}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":88.666666666666657},{"name":"Happy","score":86.75},{"name":"Creative","score":66.333333333333329},{"name":"Focused","score":60.416666666666664},{"name":"Euphoric","score":58.833333333333336}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":62.916666666666664},{"name":"Stress","score":62.833333333333329},{"name":"Fatigue","score":53.5},{"name":"Pain","score":17.166666666666664},{"name":"Spasticity","score":13}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":45.333333333333336},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":27.5},{"name":"Asthma","score":14.416666666666666},{"name":"PTSD","score":14.25},{"name":"Arthritis","score":14}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":56.833333333333336},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":19.25},{"name":"Anxious","score":15.166666666666666},{"name":"Paranoid","score":1},{"name":"Dizzy","score":0.75}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/moonshine-haze_100x100_b011.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1006188/b/moonshine-haze__primary_1d99.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/moonshine-haze_100x100_70db.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1000929/b/moonshine-haze__primary_6f4b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/moonshine-haze_100x100_f85e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/635116/b/moonshine-haze__primary_cfdd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/moonshine-haze_100x100_a846.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/633549/b/moonshine-haze__primary_c7c5.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/moonshine-haze_100x100_9608.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/633484/b/moonshine-haze__primary_0f96.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/moonshine-haze_100x100_5df2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/631211/b/moonshine-haze__primary_9faa.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":32,"popularCities":["Denver, CO","Portland, OR","Boulder, CO","Aurora, CO","Alamosa, CO","Amherst, MA","Anacortes, WA","Boston, MA","Brockton, MA","Colorado Springs, CO"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/moonshine-haze","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.36190476190476/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Nevil\u0027s Wreck","subtitle":null,"slug":"nevils-wreck","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/nevils-wreck","symbol":"Nw","applink":"leafly://strain/nevils-wreck"},{"name":"Amnesia Haze","subtitle":null,"slug":"amnesia-haze","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/amnesia-haze","symbol":"Amh","applink":"leafly://strain/amnesia-haze"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":70,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
