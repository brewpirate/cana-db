As for the appearance these buds were medium size, dense, slightly purple nugs, heavily trichomed.  Gorgeous really.  The taste and smell matched,  sweet floral notes with a nice earthy-ness. The effects are complex but I studied the high and found the following; There was absolutely zero sedation. The pain relieving qualities really stood out, but I preferred being on my feet. However I had a remarkably clear head.  So I could see where one miiiight call this indica dominant but I really felt it was evenly balanced. 9/10",

Though a sativa, This personally felt like an indica to the mind, it's a deep, almost groggy high, if you overindulge the Trainwreck will surely be most dominant. The Jack Herer saves this by keeping the high uplifted and very tolerable. \n\nIf your a musician or artist, this is a \"smoke to come up with ideas\" strain, I tried to draw but the Trainwreck side made things a bit hazy to keep focused (could just be me). Overall great strain, would recommend to someone who is looking for an Indica type strain that isn't an indica. Great creative strain!",
