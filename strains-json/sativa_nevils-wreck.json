The smell was phenomenal, the smoke was mild, tasted very earthy with that chemmy or diesel after-notes. The crystal trichromes were milky to gold colored, super sticky, hint of sweet smell. \nThe effects are what sold me though, granted I don't get too high, it subsides the anxiety, PTSD and helps with mood.\nToo much makes me paranoid; seems to be a staple feature of sativas though.",
