Go leave a strain review if you\u0027ve run into any of these in your strain hunting!\nDid one of these catch your eye? Check if it\u0027s carried at a nearby shop or dispensary by navigating to the strain page and clicking the \"Availability\" tab.\n 1. Pearl Scout Cookies\n\nPearl Scout Cookies, a GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) hybrid, is a cannabis strain developed by Fireline for recreational shops in Washington State. With a THC content that tends to push past 23%, Pearl Scout Cookies is best suited for consumers with a high tolerance. Its dense, chunky buds take on a zesty citrus aroma that brings to mind fresh lemons and oranges. Uplifting euphoria floods the mind and provides a boost of cerebral energy to fuel creativity and happiness.\n\n \n 2. Sweet and Sour Widow\n\nBred by CBD Crew, Sweet and Sour Widow is a 70/30 indica-dominant cannabis strain with a 1:1 CBD-THC ratio and a subtle sweet onion aroma. Because of its balanced cannabinoid profile, Sweet and Sour Widow’s psychoactive effects are mild, making this strain suitable for novice consumers and patients needing to medicate without a foggy head. Sweet and Sour Widow is derived from White Widow genetics and an unnamed sativa-hybrid to accentuate its CBD profile.\n\n \n 3. NightFire OG\n\nNightFire OG by Sin City Seeds is a sativa-dominant hybrid that descends from parent strains White Fire OG and White Nightmare. With strong roots in the White family, you can depend on this cannabis strain to deliver a disorienting dose of euphoria that lets you forget life’s stressors as relaxation takes over mind and body. Earthy pine, sharp lemon, and sweet berry aromas radiate from NightFire OG’s crystal-coated buds, inviting you to indulge in this hard-hitting hybrid.\n\n \n 4. Jenny Kush\n\nJenny Kush is a hybrid cannabis strain named in memory of Jenny Monson, a cannabis activist who passed away in 2013. The strain was originally bred by Rare Dankness Seeds with all proceeds going toward the Jenny Kush Foundation, a charity established to help support her children. This hybrid introduces herself with a sweet earthy aroma cut with the sharp zesty sweetness of citrus and lemon. Amnesia Haze and Rare Dankness #2 are believed to have parented Jenny Kush, giving this strain a balance of sativa and indica effects. Providing soothing relaxation with an uplifting burst, Jenny Kush is suitable for use any time of the day.\n\n \n 5. Dance World\n\nDance World is a high-CBD sativa strain bred by Royal Queen Seeds in Spain. A cross between Dancehall and Juanita La Lagrimosa, Dance World’s heritage stems primarily from Afghani and Mexican genetics. From its Dancehall parent, Dance World inherits active, uplifting effects that motivate productivity and a positive mindset. Earthy and spicy flavors dominate the palate, but subtle fruity notes bring Dance World sweet undertones. While Dance World shows its sativa genetics in its energetic effects, Dance World plants are more indica in stature and flower after just 8 weeks.\n\n \n 6. Chemdawg Sour Diesel\n\nChemdawg Sour Diesel (or Chem Sour) from Reservoir Seeds is a sativa-dominant hybrid cannabis strain that combines champion genetics from Chemdawg D and Sour Diesel. With a sharp sour bite, Chemdawg Sour Diesel has a funky fuel and earthy pine aroma that stuns the senses. Its buzzing euphoria leaves you feeling elevated and uplifted, but anxiety-prone individuals should tread carefully with this high-flying sativa.\n\n \n 7. Ken\u0027s Kush\n\nKen’s Kush is a potent hybrid cannabis strain bred by Ken Estes that crosses his famous Granddaddy Purple with the equally esteemed OG Kush and Sour Diesel. Together these parents pass on a flavor profile of sweet berries, sour skunk, and grassy earth. Dreamy relaxation pours over the mind and body, helping you feel serene without the sedation typically associated with heavy indica varieties.\n\nClick on the image to check out other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/12002258/new-strains-alert-pearl-scout-cookies-jenny-kush-nightfire-og-ken.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-pearl-scout-cookies-jenny-kush-nightfire-og-ken"}],"reviewCount":26,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":2.5862068965517242},{"name":"Pungent","score":2.5862068965517242},{"name":"Citrus","score":1.7241379310344827},{"name":"Pine","score":1.7241379310344827},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":0.86206896551724133}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":78.620689655172413},{"name":"Euphoric","score":76.896551724137936},{"name":"Uplifted","score":74.3103448275862},{"name":"Focused","score":68.620689655172413},{"name":"Creative","score":65.172413793103445}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":4.3103448275862073},{"name":"Stress","score":4.3103448275862073},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":1.7241379310344827},{"name":"Fatigue","score":1.7241379310344827},{"name":"Headaches","score":1.7241379310344827}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":2.5862068965517242},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.7241379310344827},{"name":"Migraines","score":0.86206896551724133},{"name":"PMS","score":0.86206896551724133},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":0.86206896551724133}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":3.4482758620689653},{"name":"Anxious","score":3.4482758620689653}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/nightfire-og_100x100_09c7.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/491212/b/nightfire-og__primary_3cce.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/nightfire-og_100x100_bb1e.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/464105/b/nightfire-og__primary_ad1b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/nightfire-og_100x100_dca5.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/443786/b/nightfire-og__primary_39d7.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/nightfire-og_100x100_caef.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/434061/b/nightfire-og__primary_1f06.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/nightfire-og_100x100_3bc3.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/370910/b/nightfire-og__primary_55c7.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":5,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Bellingham, WA","Everett, WA","Mount Vernon, WA","Phoenix, AZ","Tucson, AZ","East Wenatchee, WA","Flint, MI","Mesa, AZ","New River, AZ"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/nightfire-og","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.19230769230769/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"White Fire OG","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-fire-og","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/white-fire-og","symbol":"Wif","applink":"leafly://strain/white-fire-og"},{"name":"White Nightmare","subtitle":null,"slug":"white-nightmare","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/white-nightmare","symbol":"Whn","applink":"leafly://strain/white-nightmare"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":65,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tYields about 300 to 500 grams per square meter\n\n"}}
