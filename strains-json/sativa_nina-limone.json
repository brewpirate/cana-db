    "description": "<p>Nina Limone by <a href=\"https://coloradoseedinc.com\">Colorado Seed Inc.</a> is a stimulating citrus-heavy cross of <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/super-lemon-haze\">Super Lemon Haze</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/sativa/rebel-god-smoke\">Rebel God Smoke</a>. While this strain produces beautiful, rich nuggets of hard, resinous flower, the yield is small and unsuitable for mass production, but may still be found in special, rare quantities. Instead, CO Seed Inc. bred a series of strains to capture and stabilize the tropical qualities of Nina Limone in tandem with strains like <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gupta-kush\">Gupta Kush</a>, <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/flo\">Flo</a>,&nbsp;Hawaiian Sunrise, and <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-back\">Silver Back</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n",

This is one of the best I have ever laid my eyes on. The terpines are monumental! It is so sweet! In combination with the lemon it taste almost like pineapple. My batch was quite heavy by any standards @ 27% active thc. This is one to keep your eye out for. For sure. \n\n--Dallin",
