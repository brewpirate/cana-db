Its taste is a light mixture of berries, nuts and wood, surprisingly fresh. The effects of the strain match its gentle flavours as the high is mostly cerebral and a very pleasant mixture of calming and uplifting. Whatever tiny amount of CBD is in this strain does an excellent job in keeping away any anxiety.\n\nOne drawback: It incites quite a thirst.
