            "text": "I've only recently tried this one from the coffeeshops, but the 'NL5 Haze' as it was named on the list appearantly has a history as the 1st place in the Hydro category at the High Times Cannabis Cup 1996.\n\nWhile technically a hybrid, its THC content (14,64%) is far higher than its CBD content (1,22%). Its taste is a light mixture of berries, nuts and wood, surprisingly fresh. The effects of the strain match its gentle flavours as the high is mostly cerebral and a very pleasant mixture of calming and uplifting. Whatever tiny amount of CBD is in this strain does an excellent job in keeping away any anxiety.\n\nOne drawback: It incites quite a thirst. That bottle of water was meant for clearing my taste buds, not to hydrate my dry mouth.",
