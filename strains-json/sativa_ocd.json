For some, a small puff of cannabis provides unrivaled relief of worry, panic, stress, and other anxiety-related symptoms. Unfortunately others experience heightened paranoia and exacerbated anxiety with marijuana. This common reaction can be attributed to a strain’s THC content, but what many people don’t realize is there are many strains now that have little to no THC. These low-THC, high-CBD strains are changing the game for anxiety sufferers, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t strains rich in THC that can’t also help.\nThe first step to picking a good strain to combat your anxiety is recognizing your tolerance and sensitivity, and step two involves experimenting with new strains to determine which best suit your symptoms. This guide is meant to help you through the discovery process as it points out the nuances to look for the next time you visit your local dispensary.\nBest Cannabis Strains for Generalized Anxiety\n\nMany people prefer indicas over sativas because they relax the mind rather than supercharge it. For this reason we recommend Granddaddy Purple, which eases you into a peaceful mindset while urging your body to release all that stress and tension.\n\nA high-THC sativa typically wouldn’t be our first recommendation for anxiety; they tend to have racy cerebral effects that tug at anxiety rather than help it. But Jack Herer is different in that its euphoria tapers in gently with calming effects that could possibly be explained by Jack’s relaxing parent, Northern Lights.\n\nFor the THC-sensitive, we recommend the high-CBD hybrid Cannatonic. This strain typically has a CBD profile that sizes up to its THC content in a 1:1 ratio, which helps blunt the anxious edge that a lot of anxiety-sufferers experience with cannabis. Cannatonic tends to also boast high levels of the terpene myrcene, which contributes to this strain’s deeply relaxing attributes.\n“I’m not very good when it comes to marijuana with high THC contents as the effects give me anxiety. Cannatonic is high in CBD and low(er) in THC and is a great combination! It helps relieve stress and anxiety… without causing any!”\nBest Cannabis Strains for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\nGSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) has numerous Cannabis Cup awards to back up its reputation for containing staggering amounts of THC. While this may seem like a panic attack waiting to happen, studies have shown that people with PTSD often have a deficiency of a naturally occurring THC-like compound called anandamide, which plays a role in memory. When we consider the fact that THC can replenish these compounds for therapeutic benefit, it’s easy to see why so many PTSD patients sing GSC’s praises.\n“Great for PTSD-related symptoms. Vaped last night and slept really well (no night terrors) after a relaxed night with my partner. Felt equal and balanced the next day, with a much lower level of anxiety.”\n\nNot everyone wants to get stoned every time their PTSD symptoms flare up. Luckily, there are high-CBD strains like Canna-Tsu to help you keep a clear head while you medicate. Canna-Tsu still has some THC, but it’s counterbalanced by CBD for a relaxing, functional effect.\nBest Cannabis Strains for Social Anxiety\n\nSocial anxiety is tricky: you want a strain that keeps you alert and social, but nothing so stimulating that your mind races as you exude awkwardness. Strawberry Cough may be a sativa, but it manages to walk the fine line between energizing and calming, making it easy to converse without feeling overly paranoid.\n“I usually shy away from going out in the public while smoking any bud. With this, it actually felt nice to be out while being medicated. I was able to hold constructive conversations.”\n\nFor more severe cases of social anxiety, a high-CBD strain might be better suited for you. ACDC’s cannabinoid profile can vary, but it typically contains about 20 times more CBD than THC so its psychoactive effects are minimal. This makes it easy to stay relaxed, clear-headed, and focused in what would normally be an uncomfortable social situation.\nBest Cannabis Strains for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n\nThe link between OCD and cannabis is not well understood, but based on user ratings and reviews it would seem that there are a few strains out there that help settle nervous fixations. A tranquilizing indica like Northern Lights helps slow the mind and body down, bringing them into a relaxed state where the organization of your Tupperware drawer doesn’t matter quite so much.\n“Northern Lights won me to Team Indica. I suffer from OCD, social/generalized anxiety, arthritis and muscle spasms in my back. Most hybrids and sativas have made me paranoid as all hell. This might be my favorite strain so far. The overall effect was calm, relaxed, without racing thoughts, and a definite decrease in pain.”\n\nWhite Fire OG, or WiFi OG, might have high levels of THC, but many OCD patients find solace in this potent hybrid strain. This could possibly be attributed to the presence of myrcene and/or limonene, terpenes that promote relaxation and stress-relief.\nBest Cannabis Strains for Insomnia\n\nBlackberry Kush is a heavy indica strain that inherits crushingly sedating effects from its Afghani parent and a sweet berry flavor from Blueberry. This may not be a strain you can indulge in throughout the day, but you’ll be more than grateful to have it at your bedside when insomnia rears its ugly head.\n\nAnother powerfully relaxing indica strain, Purple Urkle, annihilates the anxiety and stress that keeps you tossing and turning throughout the night.\n “I have insomnia and I smoked this and slept the first full night in 6 months.”\nExplore other cannabis strains that help treat anxiety, or check out our large (and rapidly growing) database of cannabis strains to find one that’s right for you:\n\nOr try to manage your anxiety with these cannabis strains that are good for meditation:","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/12002947/what-are-the-best-cannabis-strains-for-anxiety.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/what-are-the-best-cannabis-strains-for-anxiety"},{"id":"contentitems-3481","title":"Strain Highlight: Chernobyl, the Mental Pain Reliever","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1401292800000)\/","text":"When picking up a cannabis strain to treat a particular symptom or condition, it can be difficult to know how a strain is going to benefit you. For those patients struggling with mental illness, we’d like to introduce you to Chernobyl, a sativa-dominant hybrid from TGA Seeds with the impeccable ability to null anxiety, stress, and depression in a flavorful fusion of citrus and lemon.\nIts name might sooner conjure images of Ukrainian nuclear fallout than peaceful release from body and mind, but trust us, the latter best describes the experience you can expect from Chernobyl’s sage, resinous buds. Trainwreck, Jack the Ripper, and Trinity all contribute to the genetic makeup of Chernobyl, passing on some of the most desirable characteristics found in medical marijuana strains: thick trichome coverage, a diversity of terpenes, and calming cerebral effects that stamp out negativity with ease.\n\nHow Can Chernobyl Help?\nIn order to understand why Chernobyl of all strains belongs in your medicine cabinet, we’ll need to take a closer look at the therapeutic compounds that color this sativa-dominant variety. These constituents work together in synergy to create a unique experience that goes well beyond the detectable psychoactive buzz.\nLike most cannabis varieties, Chernobyl’s most abundant chemical constituent is THC. As most of us already know, THC is the psychoactive compound responsible for euphoria, but its uses extend far past the dreamy, elevating high.\nWhile THC has the capacity to exacerbate anxiety in some individuals, its effects are highly variable and your individual response depends on a variety of factors, just like all psychiatric medications. For many patients with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, OCD, PTSD, and other mental illnesses, THC relieves psychological symptoms quickly and without the side effects often expected from legal pharmaceuticals.\nEvery patient will describe their results differently: for some, THC dissolves apathy and rekindles life’s curiosities, while others may find that cannabis slows racing thoughts to a manageable pace. Research has yet to substantiate exactly how THC effectively treats mental illness, but in Chernobyl, there are many other therapeutic compounds at work that you might not expect.\nTerpenes in Chernobyl\nTerpenes, or the aromatic oils that give cannabis its many scents and flavors, carry their own medicinal effects. Here are just a few of the terpenes abundant in Chernobyl:\nPinene\nWe often think of sativas as providing energetic and focused effects, but some of that may be a result of pinene, a terpene that promotes alertness. For patients with mental illness, this compound can help direct their attention toward productive tasks that would otherwise seem impossible in the throes of anxiety or depression.\nMyrcene\nThere’s something about Chernobyl that seems less anxiety-inducing than other sativa strains, and perhaps that’s due to the abundance of the terpene Myrcene. Myrcene is known for its relaxing qualities that help snuff out mania, depression, and stress-fueled anxiety.\nLimonene\nThat subtle lemon aroma comes from limonene, a terpene also found in rosemary, juniper, and peppermint. Limonene has a variety of mood-enhancing and stress-relieving effects useful for maintaining mental health.\nPatients living on the West Coast are more likely to come across Chernobyl at their next dispensary visit, but this TGA classic has made its way to surprising pockets far beyond Chernobyl’s birthplace.\nRemember, you can also look up other strains with comparable mental relief using Leafly’s Explorer:\n\nDepression\nStress\nAnxiety\nPTSD\nBipolar Disorder\nPMS","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/12002618/strain-highlight-chernobyl-the-mental-pain-reliever.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/strain-highlight-chernobyl-the-mental-pain-reliever"}],"reviewCount":17,"flavors":[{"name":"Tar","score":0.92592592592592582}],"effects":[{"name":"Energetic","score":62.037037037037038},{"name":"Creative","score":13.888888888888889},{"name":"Aroused","score":10.185185185185185},{"name":"Uplifted","score":7.4074074074074066},{"name":"Euphoric","score":7.4074074074074066}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":52.777777777777779},{"name":"Nausea","score":10.185185185185185},{"name":"Pain","score":9.25925925925926},{"name":"Fatigue","score":5.5555555555555554},{"name":"Depression","score":3.7037037037037033}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":57.407407407407405},{"name":"Migraines","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"PMS","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.8518518518518516},{"name":"Arthritis","score":0.92592592592592582}],"negatives":[{"name":"Paranoid","score":56.481481481481481},{"name":"Anxious","score":50.925925925925924},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":7.4074074074074066},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.8518518518518516}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/ocd_100x100_656c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/61422/b/ocd_825x550_c8bc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/ocd_100x100_45f6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/57580/b/ocd_825x550_dff0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/OCD_100x100_ag3b2d0s.1b2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1799/b/ocd_825x550_px1n4qse.qr0.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":3,"popularCities":["Newport, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/ocd","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.47058823529412/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}

For some, a small puff of cannabis provides unrivaled relief of worry, panic, stress, and other anxiety-related symptoms. Unfortunately others experience heightened paranoia and exacerbated anxiety with marijuana. This common reaction can be attributed to a strain’s THC content, but what many people don’t realize is there are many strains now that have little to no THC. These low-THC, high-CBD strains are changing the game for anxiety sufferers, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t strains rich in THC that can’t also help.\nThe first step to picking a good strain to combat your anxiety is recognizing your tolerance and sensitivity, and step two involves experimenting with new strains to determine which best suit your symptoms. This guide is meant to help you through the discovery process as it points out the nuances to look for the next time you visit your local dispensary.\nBest Cannabis Strains for Generalized Anxiety\n\nMany people prefer indicas over sativas because they relax the mind rather than supercharge it. For this reason we recommend Granddaddy Purple, which eases you into a peaceful mindset while urging your body to release all that stress and tension.\n\nA high-THC sativa typically wouldn’t be our first recommendation for anxiety; they tend to have racy cerebral effects that tug at anxiety rather than help it. But Jack Herer is different in that its euphoria tapers in gently with calming effects that could possibly be explained by Jack’s relaxing parent, Northern Lights.\n\nFor the THC-sensitive, we recommend the high-CBD hybrid Cannatonic. This strain typically has a CBD profile that sizes up to its THC content in a 1:1 ratio, which helps blunt the anxious edge that a lot of anxiety-sufferers experience with cannabis. Cannatonic tends to also boast high levels of the terpene myrcene, which contributes to this strain’s deeply relaxing attributes.\n“I’m not very good when it comes to marijuana with high THC contents as the effects give me anxiety. Cannatonic is high in CBD and low(er) in THC and is a great combination! It helps relieve stress and anxiety… without causing any!”\nBest Cannabis Strains for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\nGSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) has numerous Cannabis Cup awards to back up its reputation for containing staggering amounts of THC. While this may seem like a panic attack waiting to happen, studies have shown that people with PTSD often have a deficiency of a naturally occurring THC-like compound called anandamide, which plays a role in memory. When we consider the fact that THC can replenish these compounds for therapeutic benefit, it’s easy to see why so many PTSD patients sing GSC’s praises.\n“Great for PTSD-related symptoms. Vaped last night and slept really well (no night terrors) after a relaxed night with my partner. Felt equal and balanced the next day, with a much lower level of anxiety.”\n\nNot everyone wants to get stoned every time their PTSD symptoms flare up. Luckily, there are high-CBD strains like Canna-Tsu to help you keep a clear head while you medicate. Canna-Tsu still has some THC, but it’s counterbalanced by CBD for a relaxing, functional effect.\nBest Cannabis Strains for Social Anxiety\n\nSocial anxiety is tricky: you want a strain that keeps you alert and social, but nothing so stimulating that your mind races as you exude awkwardness. Strawberry Cough may be a sativa, but it manages to walk the fine line between energizing and calming, making it easy to converse without feeling overly paranoid.\n“I usually shy away from going out in the public while smoking any bud. With this, it actually felt nice to be out while being medicated. I was able to hold constructive conversations.”\n\nFor more severe cases of social anxiety, a high-CBD strain might be better suited for you. ACDC’s cannabinoid profile can vary, but it typically contains about 20 times more CBD than THC so its psychoactive effects are minimal. This makes it easy to stay relaxed, clear-headed, and focused in what would normally be an uncomfortable social situation.\nBest Cannabis Strains for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n\nThe link between OCD and cannabis is not well understood, but based on user ratings and reviews it would seem that there are a few strains out there that help settle nervous fixations. A tranquilizing indica like Northern Lights helps slow the mind and body down, bringing them into a relaxed state where the organization of your Tupperware drawer doesn’t matter quite so much.\n“Northern Lights won me to Team Indica. I suffer from OCD, social/generalized anxiety, arthritis and muscle spasms in my back. Most hybrids and sativas have made me paranoid as all hell. This might be my favorite strain so far. The overall effect was calm, relaxed, without racing thoughts, and a definite decrease in pain.”\n\nWhite Fire OG, or WiFi OG, might have high levels of THC, but many OCD patients find solace in this potent hybrid strain. This could possibly be attributed to the presence of myrcene and/or limonene, terpenes that promote relaxation and stress-relief.\nBest Cannabis Strains for Insomnia\n\nBlackberry Kush is a heavy indica strain that inherits crushingly sedating effects from its Afghani parent and a sweet berry flavor from Blueberry. This may not be a strain you can indulge in throughout the day, but you’ll be more than grateful to have it at your bedside when insomnia rears its ugly head.\n\nAnother powerfully relaxing indica strain, Purple Urkle, annihilates the anxiety and stress that keeps you tossing and turning throughout the night.\n “I have insomnia and I smoked this and slept the first full night in 6 months.”\nExplore other cannabis strains that help treat anxiety, or check out our large (and rapidly growing) database of cannabis strains to find one that’s right for you:\n\nOr try to manage your anxiety with these cannabis strains that are good for meditation:","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/12002947/what-are-the-best-cannabis-strains-for-anxiety.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/what-are-the-best-cannabis-strains-for-anxiety"},{"id":"contentitems-3481","title":"Strain Highlight: Chernobyl, the Mental Pain Reliever","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1401292800000)\/","text":"When picking up a cannabis strain to treat a particular symptom or condition, it can be difficult to know how a strain is going to benefit you. For those patients struggling with mental illness, we’d like to introduce you to Chernobyl, a sativa-dominant hybrid from TGA Seeds with the impeccable ability to null anxiety, stress, and depression in a flavorful fusion of citrus and lemon.\nIts name might sooner conjure images of Ukrainian nuclear fallout than peaceful release from body and mind, but trust us, the latter best describes the experience you can expect from Chernobyl’s sage, resinous buds. Trainwreck, Jack the Ripper, and Trinity all contribute to the genetic makeup of Chernobyl, passing on some of the most desirable characteristics found in medical marijuana strains: thick trichome coverage, a diversity of terpenes, and calming cerebral effects that stamp out negativity with ease.\n\nHow Can Chernobyl Help?\nIn order to understand why Chernobyl of all strains belongs in your medicine cabinet, we’ll need to take a closer look at the therapeutic compounds that color this sativa-dominant variety. These constituents work together in synergy to create a unique experience that goes well beyond the detectable psychoactive buzz.\nLike most cannabis varieties, Chernobyl’s most abundant chemical constituent is THC. As most of us already know, THC is the psychoactive compound responsible for euphoria, but its uses extend far past the dreamy, elevating high.\nWhile THC has the capacity to exacerbate anxiety in some individuals, its effects are highly variable and your individual response depends on a variety of factors, just like all psychiatric medications. For many patients with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, OCD, PTSD, and other mental illnesses, THC relieves psychological symptoms quickly and without the side effects often expected from legal pharmaceuticals.\nEvery patient will describe their results differently: for some, THC dissolves apathy and rekindles life’s curiosities, while others may find that cannabis slows racing thoughts to a manageable pace. Research has yet to substantiate exactly how THC effectively treats mental illness, but in Chernobyl, there are many other therapeutic compounds at work that you might not expect.\nTerpenes in Chernobyl\nTerpenes, or the aromatic oils that give cannabis its many scents and flavors, carry their own medicinal effects. Here are just a few of the terpenes abundant in Chernobyl:\nPinene\nWe often think of sativas as providing energetic and focused effects, but some of that may be a result of pinene, a terpene that promotes alertness. For patients with mental illness, this compound can help direct their attention toward productive tasks that would otherwise seem impossible in the throes of anxiety or depression.\nMyrcene\nThere’s something about Chernobyl that seems less anxiety-inducing than other sativa strains, and perhaps that’s due to the abundance of the terpene Myrcene. Myrcene is known for its relaxing qualities that help snuff out mania, depression, and stress-fueled anxiety.\nLimonene\nThat subtle lemon aroma comes from limonene, a terpene also found in rosemary, juniper, and peppermint. Limonene has a variety of mood-enhancing and stress-relieving effects useful for maintaining mental health.\nPatients living on the West Coast are more likely to come across Chernobyl at their next dispensary visit, but this TGA classic has made its way to surprising pockets far beyond Chernobyl’s birthplace.\nRemember, you can also look up other strains with comparable mental relief using Leafly’s Explorer:\n\nDepression\nStress\nAnxiety\nPTSD\nBipolar Disorder\nPMS","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/12002618/strain-highlight-chernobyl-the-mental-pain-reliever.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/strain-highlight-chernobyl-the-mental-pain-reliever"}],"reviewCount":17,"flavors":[{"name":"Tar","score":0.92592592592592582}],"effects":[{"name":"Energetic","score":62.037037037037038},{"name":"Creative","score":13.888888888888889},{"name":"Aroused","score":10.185185185185185},{"name":"Uplifted","score":7.4074074074074066},{"name":"Euphoric","score":7.4074074074074066}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":52.777777777777779},{"name":"Nausea","score":10.185185185185185},{"name":"Pain","score":9.25925925925926},{"name":"Fatigue","score":5.5555555555555554},{"name":"Depression","score":3.7037037037037033}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":57.407407407407405},{"name":"Migraines","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"PMS","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.8518518518518516},{"name":"Arthritis","score":0.92592592592592582}],"negatives":[{"name":"Paranoid","score":56.481481481481481},{"name":"Anxious","score":50.925925925925924},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":7.4074074074074066},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.8518518518518516}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":3,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/ocd_100x100_656c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/61422/b/ocd_825x550_c8bc.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/ocd_100x100_45f6.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/57580/b/ocd_825x550_dff0.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/OCD_100x100_ag3b2d0s.1b2.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1799/b/ocd_825x550_px1n4qse.qr0.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":3,"popularCities":["Newport, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/ocd","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.47058823529412/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
