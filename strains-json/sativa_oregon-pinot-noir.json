            "text": "It's time to kick off the weekend with some cannabis strains you've maybe never tried before. We've just added some new varieties to the Leafly Explorer \u2014 go check them out and see if any are in stock at a shop near you! Remember to leave a review if you've tried any of these so the rest of us know what to expect!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Boss Hogg\n\nBoss Hogg by Cali Connection is an indica-dominant hybrid cross between two early classics, Chemdawg 91 and Pre-98 Bubba Kush. In a show of its OG Kush heritage, Boss Hogg carries a strong earthy, hashy aroma that mixes with the funky sour diesel notes of its Chemdawg parent. This true hybrid delivers a balance of mind and body effects that ease the body into relaxation while the mind is lifted to a happy, euphoric state. Despite its heavy body effects, Boss Hogg is cerebrally stimulating and sharpens the senses to help you stay engaged and creative.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Boss Hogg\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a02. Kerala Krush\n\nKerala Krush by Flying Dutchmen is an 85% sativa strain that unites genetics from Skunk #1 and a South Indian sativa. This uplifting sativa delivers a very smooth, clear cerebral buzz with flavors of mango fruit and warm spice. Patients may gravitate to this strain for relief of menstrual cramps and nausea.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Kerala Krush\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Caramella\n\nCaramella is an 80/20 indica-dominant strain recommended for late nights out with friends as it provides an uplifting and social high. This robust strain produces long colas, deep green leaves, and sticky resin scattered around the plant like fairy dust. This easy-to-grow indica finishes flowering in about 8 to 9 weeks.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Brian Berry Cough\n\nBrian Berry Cough from TGA Genetics is a balanced 50/50 hybrid strain that crosses Strawberry Cough and Space Queen. Bred for flavor as well as potency, this strain inherits a loud strawberry and cherry aroma with traces of candied fruit. Its powerful, high-velocity effects center themselves cerebrally at first and then quickly spread to relax the rest of the body. Knots of lavender and green calyxes burst from the tall plants, crowned with deep purple-tipped fan leaves.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Brian Berry Cough\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Oregon Pinot Noir\n\nThis Hawaiian Purple Kush and Pitbull cross was bred among the grapes of a respected Pinot Noir vineyard in Oregon. Taking its name from the breeding location and its deep purple buds, this versatile plant gives off the taste of sweet grapes with a spicy hint of Haze. Though a 80/20 sativa-dominant strain, Oregon Pinot Noir gives the effects of a couch-locking indica, providing a noticeable body high best served for nighttime consumption.\n\nClick here for a full list of locations currently carrying Oregon Pinot Noir \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Kiwiskunk\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Skunk invasion landed on New Zealand\u2019s shores. Kiwiskunk was introduced when a New Zealand Skunk variety met NYC Diesel, adding a little something extra to its flavor profile. This 75/25 indica-dominant strain gives off a very potent skunky smell with sweet and citrus flavor. You\u2019ll likely be left with a happy but couch-locked feeling best enjoyed while curling up to a comedy movie.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Nepalese Jam\n\nBred by ACE Seeds, a Nepalese female plant was crossed with a Jamaican \u201985 male to create this hybrid, Nepalese Jam. If you\u2019re looking for a strain that provides a long-lasting buzz without too much mental fogginess, Nepalese Jam is the hybrid for you. With good resistance to mold, fungus, and adverse weather conditions, Nepalese Jam requires only 9 weeks of flowering to produce dense and resinous buds.\n\n\u00a0\nBrowse through our other new strains that were recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or check out last week's newest additions!",

            "text": "OMG. Absolutely amazing high. Gorgeous, deep olive green buds. Very unique, both in the way it looks and the high it gives. Although 80% Sativa, w/ a wonderful, creative cerebral high w/out being speedy or inducing paranoia, it also has a strong, relaxing feel of an indica w/out inducing a brain-sucking couch-lock. Perfect strain\ud83d\udc4c, in my opinion. Note: this strain is 25-28% THC, so definitely not for light wieghts. But it's worth getting your tolerance up to try it.\ud83d\ude09",

            "text": "Long before having a chance to get my hands on this strain there was a strong fascination for the name.  Moving from the east coast 15 years ago to Oregon one of the most charming aspects of the Willamette Valley was all the wineries.  So when hearing the name of this strain and seeing that both the parents are flowers I enjoy very much there was no doubt it was a must try strain.\n\nSo finally about a year later OPN showed up for 5 dollars a gram at one of my favorite dispensaries.  It was a great deal for a not so common strain so my detective hat went on knowing something had to be up.  This particular grow did not turn the usual deep purple that is one of its trademarks, but instead had some purple weaved throughout vein like.  \n\nThat is fine with me being it is something I've heard of happening before with other strains.  Something about the type of light spectrum that is emitted while plant is growing. What little trepidation leftover was all gone after my first toke of this bud. The taste and smell were both similarly overshadowed by a really overly sweet honey smell.  Def a noticeable grape hint and third diesel like zing gave a unique odor like a baby vomited up a jar of grape flavored honey and gasoline.  Neat to say the least.\n\nEnjoyed the terpenes a lot and that was good enough for me.  The high was very boring for my tastes with something missing.  Not a huge fan of the type of stoned where all you can think about is getting higher because the satisfaction was never really reached like it was in the flavor.  Maybe it was another factor in the type of lighting used, but this was more a straight down the middle hybrid type buzz.  The actual buds were a medium density breaking apart really nicely for rolling a doobie.\n\nLook forward to trying the Oregon Pinot Noir again with some deeper purple buds to compare.  For anything lacking the flavor more then made up for.",
