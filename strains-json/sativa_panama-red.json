            "text": "For every color in the rainbow there is a complementing strain ready to match each individual\u2019s absolute favorite hue. Only drink out of blue cups? Wear a lot of purple?\u00a0 Refuse to eat something that isn\u2019t orange-tinted? Pair your number one color with a little bit of green! Below we list a strain pairing that goes hand in hand with each letter in ROYGBIV.\nRed\n\nFiery, passionate, sensual \u2013 red is a power color that tends to\u00a0allure the sexes and could\u00a0possibly give you a promotion. Pair this magnetic color with the \u201cspeedy and intense\u201d Panama Red, a full sativa that will match that flash of red lipstick or vibrant watch band.\nOrange\n\nThis warm and fizzy hue can only pair best with a warm and fizzy strain. Enter Orange Crush \u2013 its sweet and tangy flavor perfectly complements its twin color.\nYellow\n\nIn the dead of winter, yellow reminisces sunny days and lemonade. Try Lemon Haze to melt the frost \u2013 it\u2019s a citrusy sativa whose buds appear green and yellow. The\u00a0lemony taste will bring back your sunny disposition through these chilly months.\nGreen\n\nWith 2017\u2019s color of the year being \u201cgreenery,\u201d the hybrid Green Dream is an excellent addition to any green stash.\nBlue\n\nBlue has always been a fan favorite and possibly the most popular color of the rainbow \u2013 it\u2019s calming, tranquil, and makes one think of the sky and the sea. The hybrid ArcticBlue\u00a0pairs well with this peaceful color and\u00a0its anti-anxiety effects.\nHonorable mention goes to the hybrid\u00a0Blue Dream, a strain that has become just as popular as the color itself.\nIndigo\n\nIndigo is the in-between of purple and blue \u2013 a deep, gorgeous hue that can only be complemented by the hybrid strain Blurple. It\u2019s the best mix of Blue Dream and Mendocino Purps, just as indigo is the best mix of purple and blue, aka \u201cblurple.\u201d\nViolet\n\nA color that\u00a0received its name from the violet flower, it\u2019s only logical to pair this beautiful hue with the hybrid strain Violet Delight. It releases a strong floral flavor that will\u00a0have you dreaming in shades of purple.\nIf your favorite color is outside of the rainbow spectrum, we have a couple of honorary mentions for you to pick up.\n\nPink\n\nThough pink is not technically a color of the rainbow, we couldn\u2019t leave out this bubblegum pop favorite. Pair that Pepto-Bismol toned jacket that\u2019s been collecting dust in your closet with the sweet and fruity indica Pink Berry.\nBlack\n\nFor those who live and breathe in\u00a0waves of black, don\u2019t pass up the indica Black Domina. It\u2019s a strain designed for late night,\u00a0so\u00a0grab your best black pajamas, black slippers, black robe, and pull in this heavy strain deep into the night.",

            "text": "Honey is an amazing substance \u2014 it\u2019s a natural sweetener, a super-food with a nearly endless shelf life (if sealed properly), and has\u00a0outstanding nutritional and medicinal benefits that can even help people adapt to local allergens (not to mention how delicious it is on baklava, peanut butter sandwiches, and in a cup of hot coffee or tea!).\nLeafly is home to over 60\u00a0specific strains that exhibit notes of honey. As your strain researcher and a passionate purveyor of fine cannabis, I\u2019ve curated a shortlist of honey-flavored strains that will make your fingers sticky and your taste buds smile. Enjoy!\n\u00a0 \u00a0Panama Red\nPanama Red is best described as an old-school cannabis classic. Originating from Panama, this pure sativa rose to stardom in the late 1960\u2019s thanks to its typical sativa effects: speedy and intense, bordering on psychedelic. As cannabis cultivation matured, Panama Red, which has a lengthy flowering time of at least 11 weeks, was left behind for faster growing strains and increased profits. However, those who fondly recall days of its prominence love its smooth medicating experience and loftily contemplate its revival. If you can get your hands on this sentimental throwback, do not hesitate to groove down memory lane and enjoy the ride.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Chocolate Thunder\nWhen you combine the sweet cocoa flavor of Chocolope with the strength and potency of\u00a0Alaskan Thunder Fuck, you get none other than Chocolate Thunder. This clear-headed, active\u00a0sativa may be all you need to inspire creativity or promote concentration, and patients will appreciate its ability to dull symptoms without fogging mental faculties. True to its name, Chocolate Thunder has a subtle sweet, earthy aroma similar to that of chocolate.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Thor\u2019s Hammer\nThor\u2019s Hammer by SnowHigh Seeds is an uplifting sativa strain that combines genetics from\u00a0Vortex, Cinderella 99, and Acapulco Gold. Like a bolt of lightning commanded by the Norse god himself, Thor\u2019s Hammer delivers an electrifying blast of cerebral energy that awakens\u00a0creativity and motivation. Its lightweight body effects make this strain a great choice for daytime use, and patients needing to crush fatigue and depression like the giants of Jotunheimr will likely find Thor\u2019s Hammer to be the perfect weapon. You may also find a\u00a0genetic variant of Thor\u2019s Hammer from Alaska\u00a0that instead\u00a0combines God Bud and Sour Diesel\u00a0in a more balanced indica-sativa hybrid cross.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Honey Banana\nHoney Bananas from Elemental Seeds is a heavy-handed hybrid strain bred from Strawberry Banana and Honey Boo Boo. This cannabis strain earns its name with a resinous coat as sticky as honey and an unmistakable banana aroma. She leans heavily toward the indica side of the family, providing weighty full-body effects coupled with an invigorating buzz of cerebral euphoria.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Lodi Dodi\nLodi Dodi is a sativa-dominant hybrid popular in Washington State. Exclusively bred by The Clone Zone, the genetic heritage of Lodi Dodi is undefined and closely guarded. Lodi Dodi carries a sweet, unique flavor of tropical fruit and fresh wildflowers. The pungent aroma leads the way towards a cerebral buzz, known to spark creativity and a boost of energy that will turn any task into a more enjoyable adventure.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Nebula\nThe Nebula marijuana strain was bred by Paradise Seeds in 1996. Its name means \u201cStarcloud\u201d and it has been known to \u201ctwinkle\u201d with THC coating, with a head and body buzz described as intense and almost psychedelic. The buds have been known to smell and taste like honey, and flowering time is a minimum of 9 weeks. Nebula has won many awards, including 3rd place in the sativa category at the High Times Cannabis Cup in 1999 and 2nd place in 2005. It also took 3rd place at the Highlife Cup in 2004 in the Hydro category, and 1st place at the Copa La Bella Flor Spain in 2005.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Fortune Cookies\nFortune Cookies is a hybrid cannabis strain that combines the famed genetics of GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) and OG Kush in a potent mix of earthy, honeyed flavors. OG Kush genes are already present in GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies), but Fortune Cookies has pronounced characteristics that OG fans will appreciate. Sativa genetics usually lead the way with Fortune Cookies, inducing a soaring, long-lasting buzz perfect for creative escapes. This hybrid can hit hard in larger doses, pushing past the confines of a subtle buzz into the weighty \u201ccouch-lock\u201d effects typically associated with indica strains.\n\u00a0 \u00a0BC Sweet Tooth\nDeveloped in British Columbia by BC Bud Depot, BC Sweet tooth is an indica-dominant hybrid known for its quick flowering time and candy taste. \u00a0A hardy plant, this strain can be grown outdoors where it can flower in under 7 weeks, but it prefers the indoors where it may flower as soon as 6 weeks. The result of a cross with earlier generations of BC Sweet Tooth and classic\u00a0Sweet Tooth, these sugary flowers are sure to satisfy your craving. The crystalline buds have a strong, sweet smell with a hint of citrus, and consumers\u00a0report that this treat satisfies with a long-lasting, potent feeling that hits fast.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Danky Doodle\nOriginally named Double D as a reference to the large buds on these plants (we\u2019ll let you make the connection there), breeder KC Brains decided to rename the strain Danky Doodle at the suggestion of some American friends in order to avoid confusion with the similarly named Double Dutch. Danky Doodle certainly isn\u2019t a shy plant; it grows like the weed it is and will make its presence known with its pungent sweet smell. Plants flower at 9 to 11 weeks and should provide a high yield of large buds covered in a rich frost. This plant is a cross between several strains, and it\u2019s no surprise that Big Bud is included in its lineage along with the strains Viking and the breeder\u2019s own KC 636. The result is a strong indica that provides full body relief no matter what you call it.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Cream Caramel\nCream Caramel, named after its sweet caramel aroma, is a 90% indica cross between BlueBlack, Maple Leaf Indica, and White Rhino. Covered in a sugary coat of THC-rich resin, Cream Caramel delivers heavy, relaxing indica effects that soothe the mind and body. Though originally bred by Sweet Seeds in Spain, Royal Queen Seeds have also championed their own rendition called Royal Caramel. Early October is the finish line for outdoor Cream Caramel flowers, while indoor gardens should be harvested after a 7 to 8 week flowering period.",

            "text": "Panama Red is a euphoric experience which will leave you anywhere between laughing hysterically at your film of choice and contemplating life from the most metaphysical plane you've ever been on. Having been a smoker for some years, this is hands down one of my favourite sativas so far. Whereas some can (often pleasingly) come on with a full-hitting head-dizzying high, Panama Red leaves plenty of space for your own personal thought and leaves a deep-seated feeling of happiness and incredibly enhanced perceptive ability. A rare sunny day here in the UK morphed into an endless parade of sunshine and beautiful landscapes. I would definitely, without a doubt, recommend this strain. The only negative is that for those used to super intense highs which prevent you from functioning, this might a little outside the norm. You can 100% get to work/get out and about/focus through this weed, ften feeling fantastic about doing so!",
