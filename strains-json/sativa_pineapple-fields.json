Bud structure is perfect! -aroma, density, moisture, and it\u0027s quite an easy smoke. Excellent flavor, altho def more üçç-aroma than üçç-taste, \u0026 nary a fruity hint at all, which surprises me bc pretty decent (8+) terp-profile. Pretty earthy, smooth flavor, altho this particular strain is pretty generic-tasting, which would prob be excellent for newbies who don\u0027t like a harsh üí® smoke.. hardly even an after-taste! I prefer a flavor+euphoria blast that makes me remember it. This one smokes more like a hybrid, however, which makes it good choice for a creative, productive daytime smoke.. it\u0027s calming, rather than racy, perfect for my anxiety + ADHD. ‚Ä¢ Solid 4.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è-strain..
