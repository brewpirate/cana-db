            "text": "\u2022 Trying Theraplant's THC-23% Pineapple \ud83c\udf4d Fields for 3rd time since buying new med 3 days ago. Bud structure is perfect! -aroma, density, moisture, and it's quite an easy smoke. Excellent flavor, altho def more \ud83c\udf4d-aroma than \ud83c\udf4d-taste, & nary a fruity hint at all, which surprises me bc pretty decent (8+) terp-profile. Pretty earthy, smooth flavor, altho this particular strain is pretty generic-tasting, which would prob be excellent for newbies who don't like a harsh \ud83d\udca8 smoke.. hardly even an after-taste! I prefer a flavor+euphoria blast that makes me remember it. This one smokes more like a hybrid, however, which makes it good choice for a creative, productive daytime smoke.. it's calming, rather than racy, perfect for my anxiety + ADHD. \u2022 Solid 4.5 \u2b50\ufe0f-strain.. (I'd prefer SOME kinda taste! ;) but great overall smoke \ud83d\udca8 I recommend to newbies & those looking for sativa-leaning hybrid to promote daytime productivity while relieving aches + pains \u2014> just noticed pain went from a 7 to 4, after 1 bowl of bong, approximately 5-6 hits. \nNot \ud83d\udd25, but \ud83d\udd25 isn't always appropriate! \u2022\u270c\ud83c\udffd\u2022",

Rolled myself a little joint cuz I\u2019m waiting for my piece to come in the mail but I couldn\u2019t resist how good it smells. Felt a nice sense of relaxation and my pain level was decreasing. I\u2019m going back for more!",
