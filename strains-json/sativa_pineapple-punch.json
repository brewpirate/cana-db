Originally named Soma Skunk V, the more aptly named Reclining Buddha provides a physically relaxing experience that allows enough mental energy for introspective and creative activities. Growers are drawn to this indica’s resistance to mold, vitality outdoors, and large yields of resinous, cherry-scented buds.\n\n \n 7. Peaches and Cream\n\nThe Peaches and Cream hybrid is a Skunk phenotype with a flavor that lives up to its name. Though floral and citrusy in aroma, Peaches and Cream has a sweet fruity taste underscored by a subtle spiciness. Its buds take on a soft pink-orange color during maturation with bright amber hairs bursting from pastel calyxes. Heady euphoria gives way to creativity and good moods, making this strain an excellent choice for focused tasks and unwinding after work.\n\nFind out which stores and dispensaries are currently carrying Peaches and Cream\n \nCheck out our other new strains recently added to the Leafly Explorer, or catch up on last week\u0027s recently added strains!","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12001941/new-strains-alert-bettie-page-space-candy-jolly-rancher-pineapple.png","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/new-strains-alert-bettie-page-space-candy-jolly-rancher-pineapple"}],"reviewCount":28,"flavors":[{"name":"Pineapple","score":29.38311688311688},{"name":"Tropical","score":28.246753246753244},{"name":"Sweet","score":12.824675324675324},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":7.1428571428571423},{"name":"Lemon","score":7.1428571428571423}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":29.38311688311688},{"name":"Creative","score":28.246753246753244},{"name":"Euphoric","score":27.11038961038961},{"name":"Uplifted","score":21.1038961038961},{"name":"Energetic","score":18.506493506493506}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Stress","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Fatigue","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Insomnia","score":2.2727272727272729}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.1363636363636365},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.1363636363636365},{"name":"Hypertension","score":1.1363636363636365},{"name":"PTSD","score":1.1363636363636365}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":23.7012987012987},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":14.285714285714285}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-punch_100x100_bf92.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/510448/b/pineapple-punch__primary_4472.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/pineapple-punch_100x100_8961.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/401020/b/pineapple-punch__primary_b350.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Seattle, WA","Aberdeen, WA","Bellingham, WA","Damascus, OR","Ephrata, WA","Everett, WA","Lynnwood, WA","Mukilteo, WA","Portland, OR","San Diego, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-punch","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.53571428571429/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Skunk No. 1","subtitle":null,"slug":"skunk-1","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1","symbol":"Sk1","applink":"leafly://strain/skunk-1"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":"Soil","floweringDays":67,"outdoorFinish":"Late October","height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tYields about 300-500 grams per square meter\n\tMay express two different phenotypes:\u0026nbsp;one grows\u0026nbsp;taller and more sativa-like with thin leaves and wide internodal spacing, and the other is more indica-like with closer nodes, wider leaves, shorter stature, and heavier yields\n\tSoil preferred, but also suitable for hydro grows\n\tLow to medium organic nutrient regimen recommended\n\n"}}

I usually ease the pain in my knees at the end of the night by hitting the Grape. So for me to decide to try medication during the day was something new for me. I looked around the sight for the medicine I was looking for. I thought I found it in Pineapple Punch. So I tried it... I grabbed an 8th from my dispensary. Took it home. Started to try to break the buds from the limbs of the stem and noticed it was about to be tedious. So after some time I stuck a little in a bowl.  Now usually after one hit I sit back and feel what it\u0027s about to do to me. But after 30 seconds I was up walking around. Thinking about what I was about to get into. I completely forgot about everything that I had going on. After 2 minutes of planning my future, I decided to give it another try.\n3 minutes later I had the perception I was the greatest musician that the world had ever heard.

Space Candy\n\nSpace Candy originally comes from the gardens of TGA Genetics, who bred this hybrid strain by crossing Cherry Space Queen and Cotton Candy.
