            "text": "THCV, or tetrahydrocannabivarin, is a compound in cannabis that offers a unique array of effects and medical benefits that sets it apart from other cannabinoids like THC and CBD. Whether you\u2019re a medical marijuana patient looking for a particular type of relief or a casual consumer chasing a specific effect, we\u2019d like to introduce you to this fascinating compound that\u2019s sure to make major waves in the cannabis world as we discover and utilize its full potential.\nWhat are THCV\u2019s Effects and Benefits?\nAs its name suggests, THCV is similar to THC in molecular structure and psychoactive properties, but it provides a variety of pronounced and altogether different effects. A note for vaporizer enthusiasts: THCV has a boiling point of 428 \u00b0F (220 \u00b0C), so you\u2019ll need to turn it up higher than you would THC.\n\n\nTHCV is an appetite suppressant. In contrast to THC, THCV may dull the appetite. This may be good for consumers focused on weight loss, but THCV should be avoided by patients treating appetite loss or anorexia.\nTHCV may help with diabetes. Research shows promise in THCV\u2019s ability to regulate blood sugar levels and reduce insulin resistance.\nTHCV may reduce panic attacks. It appears to curb anxiety attacks in PTSD patients without suppressing emotion.\nTHCV may help with Alzheimer\u2019s. Tremors, motor control, and brain lesions associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease appear to be improved by THCV, but research is in progress.\nTHCV stimulates bone growth. Because it promotes the growth of new bone cells, THCV is being looked at for osteoporosis and other bone-related conditions.\n\n\nWhere Can I Find THCV?\nSo you\u2019re looking for the effects mentioned above, but you aren\u2019t sure where to start your search for high-THCV strains and products. Most strains only contain trace, undetectable amounts of THCV, making it difficult to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. We can assume that more THCV-rich products will be introduced alongside its growing popularity, but in the meantime, here are some useful hints for locating this rare therapeutic gem.\n\nLook for African sativas. Lab results show that THCV is most abundant in sativas, particularly landrace strains from Africa. Durban Poison is one of the more common high-THCV strains, but other options can be found in the strain list below.\nAsk about parent genetics. Having trouble finding an African sativa? Plenty of strains have hybridized African genetics that predispose it to a higher THCV potential. Cherry Pie, for example, may express a high THCV content by way of its Durban Poison parent. Look for lineage information in Leafly\u2019s strain pages or ask your budtenders to point out their African hybrids.\nRequest test results. Genetics alone can\u2019t promise a high-THCV content, and cannabinoid contents can vary from harvest to harvest. If possible, ask your budtender for lab-tested strains to ensure that you\u2019re indeed getting a THCV-rich product.\n\n\nHigh THCV Cannabis Strains\nThis list is by no means comprehensive, but it includes strains best known for their tendency toward higher-than-average THCV contents. These strains can be consumed in flower form or they can be processed into extracts, oils, and edibles for a higher concentration of cannabinoids. A few of the strains below, like Doug\u2019s Varin and Pineapple Purps,\u00a0were specially bred to contain higher levels of THCV. Again, be sure to steer your choices toward African sativas as they tend to contain the most THCV.\n\n\n\n\nDoug\u2019s Varin\n\nPineapple Purps\n\nDurban Poison\n\n\n\nPower Plant\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nRed Congolese\n\n\n\nJack the Ripper\n\nDurban Cheese\n\nSkunk #1",

            "text": "Lots of new strains are waiting for you in the Leafly Explorer, but we'd like to highlight five of our favorite\u00a0newcomers this week. With names based on\u00a0Breaking Bad\u00a0puns and overpriced fashion accessories, maybe a few of these varieties will pique your interest. Already had a chance to test drive one of these fine specimens? Review, review, review. We're dying to know what you thought!\n\u00a0 \u00a01. Dank Schrader\nCharacteristics of Dank Schrader:\n\nDank Schrader is the house strain at\u00a0The Healing Center\u00a0in Vancouver, BC. The strain was developed during the final season of Breaking Bad and is named after DEA Agent Hank Schrader, a character on the show. Dank Schrader crosses\u00a0Rockstar Kush\u00a0with\u00a0Bubba Kush\u00a0to create a potent and\u00a0relaxing\u00a0indica-driven\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that has tested out as high as 27%\u00a0THC\u00a0according to dispensary\u2019s lab results, performed by Hedron Analytical.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Pineapple Purps\nCharacteristics of\u00a0Pineapple Purps:\n\nPineapple Purps is a\u00a0sativa-dominant strain that is rarely found but always cherished by those looking for strains with a high\u00a0THCV\u00a0cannabinoid profile. THCV, a compound known to block\u00a0panic attacks, reduce\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s\u00a0tremors, and suppress the appetite, is typically only found in trace amounts in most cannabis, but Pineapple Purps is a special variety that can express a THC:THCV ratio of 3:1. This strain is highly psychoactive and\u00a0energetic, but its effects generally won\u2019t last as long as low-THCV varieties.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Gucci OG\nCharacteristics of\u00a0Gucci OG:\n\nGucci OG is an\u00a0OG Kush\u00a0variant named with the lavish cannabis connoisseur in mind. Hailing from southern California like so many of its OG relatives, Gucci OG takes on the family\u2019s signature aroma of\u00a0pine\u00a0and\u00a0lemon, but with a unique hint of\u00a0sweet\u00a0berry. This hybrid\u2019s effect can vary with different doses; small amounts may provide a spark of\u00a0energy\u00a0and\u00a0creativity, while larger doses tend to give way to heavy\u00a0sedation\u00a0or dizzying\u00a0euphoria.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a04. White Fire 43\nCharacteristics of\u00a0White Fire 43:\n\nWhite Fire 43 is a select\u00a0phenotype\u00a0of\u00a0White Fire OG\u00a0grown by\u00a0TLC Collective\u00a0in Los Angeles, CA. Number 43 was the standout phenotype in a lot of over 500 White Fire OG seeds, originally bred by OG Raskal. White Fire 43 is known for its exceptional\u00a0cannabinoid\u00a0production, with claims of test results regularly nearing 30%. The strong medicinal and\u00a0pain-fighting effects are ushered in with a\u00a0pungent\u00a0earthy\u00a0aroma that is amplified by flavors of\u00a0lemons\u00a0and sour\u00a0citrus. White Fire 43 is an\u00a0indica-dominant\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that is great before bedtime, helping you\u00a0relax,\u00a0decompress, and find\u00a0sleep.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Orange Cookies\nCharacteristics of\u00a0Orange Cookies:\n\nOrange Cookies bred by Franchise Genetics is a\u00a0hybrid\u00a0that combines\u00a0Orange Juice\u00a0with the renowned\u00a0GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies). A flavor-packed strain, Orange Cookies expresses itself with a strong aroma of\u00a0sweet\u00a0citrus\u00a0that closely resembles a fresh tangerine. The flavors of Orange Cookies gives way to deep calming body effects that mingle with a\u00a0euphoric\u00a0cerebral buzz to leave you\u00a0happy\u00a0and\u00a0relaxed.",

I picked this up from a friends father who suffers from hard pain and anxiety attacks. Its a unique strain for sure put has a nice berry smell along with textures of it but after a while tastes like wood and stale pungent-ness. This has nice creative sides to this and will put it on a must list to grow, so much better than Panama red in my opinion. Would do this strain to the moon and back great for really unwinding all the way and not holding a dam thing back absolute bliss for this strain 5stars!
