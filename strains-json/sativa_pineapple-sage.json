My high seemed almost entirely contained in my head, which I prefer a lot of the time. No signs of anxiety or sleepiness, definitely fuels creativity and I was able to maintain sharp focus after smoking. Definitely up there on the list of fragrant flowers. This stuff smells incredible and tastes fairly well, too. Glad I discovered this strain.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/YEN1LqXiYCOvWiFhmP-4p67iqDM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fY9fB9qHySLml8016ysgJ_goggles-green.png"},{"id":1617218,"username":"amberleena","text":"Very clear buzz. Releases tension in the back of the head and dulls girl cramps. Can feel the initial high behind the eyes and center of the head. It mellows to an awake and comfortable buzz.
