            "text": "Have you noticed more people walking around your neighborhood swiping on their cell phone in an almost zombie-like-state recently? Chances are, that person is trying to catch \u2018em all on the new gaming app Pok\u00e9mon GO, which his already been installed more times in its first week than the dating app Tinder in its five years of existence. After a few of us here at Leafly were wandering around the office trying to capture a creature, we figured we\u2019d give our tired legs a break and come up with a list of the best cannabis strains to pair with your next Pok\u00e9mon GO session.\nPick up one of these strain options before you get back out there and start playing right Meowth.\n\u00a0\u00a0Fire OG\nFire OG is an ideal choice for the next time you and your friends are out trying to catch the fire-breathing Charizard. Powerful in its own right, Charizard\u2019s flame is so hot, it can melt boulders, making it the perfect match for the strongest of the OG strains that sports red hairs (which gives this hybrid its \u201cFire\u201d name).\n\u201cFire OG is NOT to be underestimated. As a super- sativa afficanado [sic] I\u2019m usually somewhat [relatively] underwhelmed by decent, but dime a dozen \u201cOG\u2019s.\u201d This however, is a kick in the face and a ripping sativa one at that. Fire OG and its crosses Firewalker (fire x skywalker) and Fire King (x king louis) are all superior, (while I believe the latter to be the strongest) this is fucking intense and uplifting until you start to feel your eyes seal. Once that happens (an hour thirty in) you ARE going to relax\u2026 fetally. 10/10.\u201d \u2013 Jackboothe\n\u00a0\u00a0Durban Poison\nFeeling a little sleepy while on your walk? Don\u2019t end up feeling like a Snorlax The pure sativa Durban Poison will be the perfect strain to help you stay in tune with your surroundings.\n\u201cDoes not get any better than this,exactly what you would expect from a sativa, energizing uplifting and a very tasty sweet pine and citrus flavor, definitely one of my top 5 favorite strains.\u201d \u2013 RiPpEdCiTy\n\u00a0\u00a0707 Headband\nAnother strain that can help treat some tension and anxiety you might face when trying to catch \u2018em all, Headband 707 brings a strong hybrid high that leaves consumers feeling \u201cheady\u201d and creative rather than sleepy.\n\u201cWith its strong, sweet aroma, headband is a sensation for even the most critical of cannabis pundits. I enjoy the creative/anxiolytic effects that come up, makes my dreams appear as if I am a young Pokemon master. The old Pokemon, not this new crap.\u201d \u2013 Dwarren\n\u00a0\u00a0Poison Haze\nWhile out trying to catch the poison/ground type Nidoqueen, this Poison Haze strain with its sweet, citrus aroma will help you take her and her powerful tail down in battle. Its energetic and happy high will help any adult Pok\u00e9mon fan through his or her voyage in catching the characters.\n\u201cThis is an extremely potent strain with a intense powerful high. The high was similar to the high from durban poison, except it lasted a hell of a lot longer. It was a very enjoyable high. Got rushes of energy and these wierd phycadelic [sic] -like experiences which were coming and going as i was smoking the blunt. I wouldnt say i was tripping, as that is impossible from consuming marijaunna [sic], but it was just odd. great and extremely enjoyable, but odd. the only downside to this bud is the high didnt last that long, and wore off after about an hour or so. On the positive side there was no burnout, and the bud had a nice fruity lemony taste to it. I would definately [sic] recommend this bud. the high it provided me with was very unique and pleasant. This is not for new smokers. This bud also made me very active but, due to the short duration of the high, could be smoked before bed.\u201d \u2013 patrickbasler\n\u00a0\u00a0Super Silver Haze\nAre you at the point in your Pok\u00e9mon GO journey where all you want to do is get blasted with Blastoise? The four-time High Times Cannabis Cup winner Super Silver Haze will do the job with its energetic, long-lasting body high.\n\u201cThe strongest sativa. Especially from a skilled grower, it lives up to and exceeds high expectations. Incredible mood-enhancement, legendary taste and smell.\u201d \u2013 nolovedeepweb\n\u00a0\u00a0Agent Orange\nFeeling a bit crabby on your walk to capture Pok\u00e9mon? Don\u2019t end up like Krabby! Instead, try the hybrid Agent Orange strain to help bring an uplifting, happy high to your journey.\n\u201cpretty potent strain have a munch pack ready( I spent 10 bucks Worth of muchies [sic] it smelled just like sunny d to me(x this strain had me very talkative, had me going through so many detailed stories I\u2019d say this is a good strain for anyone going through depression, as it is very high in euphoria\u201d \u2013 happy0102\n\u00a0\u00a0Incredible Hulk\nNeed a little extra kick on your final push in finding Pok\u00e9mon characters? The Incredible Hulk sativa will help you not end up like Slowpoke, giving a creative and social energy boost while the blueberry, pineapple, and earthy flavors overwhelm the palate.\n\u201cgood sativa. smokes smooth and makes you feel really euphoric and uplifted. gives a very energetic and doesn\u2019t make you tired as most strains will. This is a great sativa but you\u2019ll always want an indica or hybrid around for the nighttime full body relaxation.\u201d \u2013 MahoneyMcLeaf",

            "text": "Labeled as Durban Haze, but am pretty sure it is the same strain as Poison Haze.  A little shake of the jar or squeeze from this nug will give it extra pop that is not there initially.  Or at least not there in such intense extravagant detail.  Cocoa again as if this receptor was opened up recently so this terpene is noticed more.  Or my cannabis diet has been sativa heavy with my needs going more in that direction in the winter months. The market in my area of Eugene, Oregon within the dispensaries I traverse has been high percentage sativa strains like Clementine, Honey Badger Haze, Super Lemon Haze, and with great approval & appreciation lots of heady, dank (as a duck, Go Ducks!!!) Headband to name a few =)\n\nTo pull this back around to that cocoa, but not really it is more of a chemie diesel like taste.  But kind of rich like dark chocolate and similar at times to that scent of fuel that is not supposed to be enjoyed, yet smells really good even if only briefly.  Reminds of traveling waking up to the gas button being pressed snapping open the door so close to our head lost in dreams.  That gas smell lulling back into the abyss of dream.  Durban Haze mixes that hazy side with that upbeat pine of Durban.  \n\nUpbeat weed for getting stuff done or hiking.  One of the few strains that might be suggested for depression even as a very potent cannabis the come down is not abrupt or hard.  It is not a heart thumping sativa that would cause anxiety either.  Personally I like to couple flower like this with coffee, but on its own I can easily still want to take a nap or veg out.  I mean it is weed & in comparison this is not extremely animated like Hawaiian for example.  One of my faves, but I like intense highs which even at a high dose meaning a lot, often 2 grams/ 1 day with bud weighing in THC 21.86% CBD 0.6% in lab tests mixed with many other strains of varied doses throughout day this was never to heavy for public or a clear thought process.\n\nSomeone might use this for light pain such as a headache or pulled muscles.  More of a mood & appetite enhancing definitely could help pain be overlooked with uplifted motivated high.  Definitely would grab again under the right circumstances.",
