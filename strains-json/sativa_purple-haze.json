            "text": "Cannabis has long been a companion for creative minds. It has a way of expanding the imagination, enabling access to new thoughts, concepts, and ideas. For many of us, cannabis adds color to our world and allows us to appreciate small nuances that are normally filtered out by our busy brains.\nNot all strains are created equal, thanks to differences in their terpene and cannabinoid profiles. Sure, some artists couldn\u2019t care less what strains they keep stocked alongside pens and brushes, but others swear by specific strains and rely on them for stimulating creative thought.\nThis list features strains that Leafly reviewers rate as highly creative, so consider giving them a try if you\u2019re looking to kindle inspiration.\n\nKali Mist\n\nSometimes the only thing separating you from reaching creative flow is a lack of energy. Kali Mist, a bright and euphoric sativa strain, shakes your imagination awake and imbues it with colorful stimulation that inspires as well as motivates.\n\n\u201cIf you want to delve into some new and interesting concepts \u2013 if what you\u2019re after is refreshing uplifting bouts of fluid confident creativity and clarity of thought, Kali Mist is where it\u2019s at.\u201d \u2013KennedyBash\n\nJack Herer\n\nWith a sharp pine aroma that promotes an alert, focused mindset, Jack Herer is famous for good reason. Its mellow, even-keel high leaves the mind flexible and with room to stretch creative muscles.\n\n\u201cAstounding creativity off this stuff, first time being high has made me feel smarter.\u201d \u2013 itsdeliciouschi\n\n\nChemdawg\n\nChemdawg is a potent hybrid best reserved for the seasoned consumer looking to turbo boost creativity. Its high can be dizzying and cumbersome, but if you\u2019re seeking strong euphoria that jars the senses and summons new pathways of thought, Chemdawg might be the powerhouse hybrid you\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\n\u201cI had many thoughts rush through my head and it was a little overwhelming but once I settled into the high it was very creative, imaginative and invigorating.\u201d \u2013 Indaking\n\nPurple Haze\n\nA strain that seems to turn up saturation and definition like an HD movie, Purple Haze unlocks the highest potential of your senses. Lending energy and positivity to the mind, this sativa knocks down bad moods, lethargy, and anything else standing in the way between you and your next artistic project.\n\n\u201cGood for the creative types who love to have a toke with their brush strokes or good for the student looking to cram for the exam.\u201d \u2013 Schmo\n\nLSD\n\nNamed for its trippy, awe-inspiring high, LSD is a hybrid strain that\u2019ll spin and twist your imagination, wringing out all of the creativity inside. Use this strain to cast a new light on conscious thought while it illuminates concepts and ideas hiding in your mind\u2019s depths.\n\n\u201cThis strain is THE BEST when it comes to coming up with creative ideas. If you\u2019re having creative block or writers block, I recommend this strain a lot.\u201d \u2013 GinoMidnight\n\n\nBerry White\n\nThough most people associate sativa strains with creativity, some minds require pacifying before engaging in art or other creative escapes. Overactive minds\u2013especially those afflicted by anxiety or PTSD\u2013can benefit from the slow pace of Berry White\u2019s effects. Artists experiencing debilitating pain or inflammation may also find that this indica\u2019s soothing physical effects take their mind off the aches, allowing full immersion in the task at hand.\n\n\u201cBerry White leaves me relaxed and helps me forget my chronic back pain. I am always given creative insights when I am about an hour into the high.\u201d \u2013 TechDesigner\n\nTangie\n\nTangie is a sativa strain that offers many gifts: long-lasting euphoria, a sweet citrus flavor almost indiscernible from ripe tangerines, and a creative kick that expands thought. Its meditative, patient, and focusing high is perfect for settling deep into a long project, especially one that might otherwise feel long and tedious.\n\n\u201cI felt sufficiently high, but very much in the circumstance of what was going on around me. This is a state of mind where I can be very creative, aware, and at peace all at the same time.\u201d \u2013 Brian\n\n\nJillybean\u00a0\n\nA beautiful plant that blooms with sparkling trichomes and colorful hues, Jillybean shares her vibrancy through bright, blissful euphoria. This hybrid helps you shed stress and bad moods, leaving you free to navigate your imagination without burden.\n\n\u201cJillybean is a nice hybrid that melts away inhibitions, creative blocks and allows for true relaxation. Like a vacation in a flower, this bud will have layers of high energy sativa that helped keep my house clean but also slowly bring on some of the best sleep I\u2019ve had in years.\u201d \u2013jeahisaidit\n\nTo find more creative strains, explore others in Leafly\u2019s strain database by clicking here.",

Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Purple Haze is a classic sativa strain made popular by the late Jimi Hendrix. Thought to be a cross of Purple Thai and Haze, this strain offers a stimulating and euphoric high. Its flavor is fruity, sweet, and earthy.\nGrow Techniques: Known to be a hardy, resilient strain, Purple Haze is a good choice for novice growers. Grow outside with healthy soil, or grow hydroponically. Prune and top the plant to keep a uniform and bushy shape while making sure to support the colas as they develop. The strain does not always produce purple buds, but you can lower the temperature of your grow room or grow outside to coerce purple hues.\nFlowering Time: 8-9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Easy\nClimate: Purple Haze does fine in northerly climates with colder nights, but prefers temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Outdoor gardens tend to produce bigger yields, but Purple Haze does well indoors as well.\nFeeding: Feed moderately during flowering, then bump up the phosphorus to maximize the yield.",
