The flavor profiles will be even sweeter if you can find a Raspberry Cough strain that was flushed with brown sugar or molasses before harvesting.\nThese Raspberry Cough Bars, which are also gluten free, can be enjoyed at any time of the day and will crush a sweet tooth craving in an instant. The Raspberry Cough strain creates an alert-minded yet peaceful state of awareness when consumed. It is perfect for treating depression, motivating a tired body, reducing anxiety, and centering the spirit.\nPlan on spending time outdoors doing physical activities such as trail hiking, snowboarding, or running? Then this edible will do the trick for you. On the other side of the coin, the hybrid properties are also great for staying at home and defragmenting your thoughts through meditation; cleaning the house; or enjoying your favorite meal with friends.\nEnjoy a bar with your favorite cup of coffee or tea, and let the terpenes of this treat inspire your senses!\nRaspberry Cough Cannabis-Infused Bars\nStart to finish: 1 hour (active: 10 minutes)\nYields: 12 bars (or 6 larger bars)\nApproximate dosage: 30 milligrams*\nBar ingredients:\n\n1 cup organic gluten free flour\n1 cup organic gluten free rolled oats\n3/4 cup reduced sugar organic raspberry jam\n1/2 cup Raspberry Cough-infused organic raw coconut oil, at room temperature\n1/2 cup organic light brown sugar\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/8 teaspoon Himalayan pink sea salt\n\n\nCrumb topping ingredients:\n\n3/4 cup organic gluten free flour\n1/2 cup non-infused raw coconut oil, at room temperature\n1/2 cup organic sugar\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n\nDirections:\n\nPreheat your oven to 350˚F and grease an 8-inch square pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt.\nMix all the dry ingredients together until fully incorporated, then add the Raspberry Cough-infused coconut oil.\nUse your hands or the back of a large wooden spoon to blend the dry ingredients into the raw coconut oil until it becomes a crumb mixture.\nPress this mixture into the bottom of your greased pan, making sure the mixture remains level within the pan. Using another spoon or spatula, spread the raspberry jam on top, getting it as close to the edge of the crumb bar base as possible without touching the walls of the pan.\nIn another bowl, combine your crumb topping ingredients: flour, sugar, coconut oil, and cinnamon (this adds a little warmth and spice). Stir all the ingredients until fully integrated into a crumbly topping.\nTake your crumb topping and sprinkle it evenly over the raspberry jam.\nPlace in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes or until the top is lightly browned. Cool completely before cutting into either 6 large bars or 12 small ones.\n\nNotes:\n\nOn dosing: If one gram of Raspberry Cough that you use to make the cooking oil tests at 20% THC, twenty percent of 1,000mg would be 200mg. So if you used three grams of this strain at 20% THC, the recipe would theoretically contain 600mg total, or 50mg in each of 12 bars (sub the THC percentage of your own cannabis and do the same math to figure out your own theoretical dosage). That said, there are myriad chemical reactions that can reduce the potency of your cooking oil along the way, so the bars will likely contain decidedly less than that – probably closer to 30 milligrams. Always sample a small portion of one serving first and wait a couple hours to see how it affects you before consuming more.\nOn altering the dosage: If you want a smaller dose, either cut the cannabis down to a smaller amount or cut your bars into 24 servings instead of 12. If you want a higher dose, add more Raspberry Cough or cut the bars into six servings.\nOn strain substitutions: I would recommend strains that possess fruity terpenes, which will pair well with the flavors of raspberry and the bar itself. If you don’t have Raspberry Cough, either Fruity Pebbles, Haze Berry, Juicy Fruit, or Cindy 99 will do the trick. If you can’t find any of these strains, don’t panic! Just follow your nose and taste buds to select strains that would complement the dish. Have fun with it!\n\n*Note: The amount of infused coconut oil specified in this recipe is a very loose suggestion; the actual amount you use should be modified based on the strength of your oil and the potency you desire. Dosing homemade edibles can be tricky (click here to learn why), so the best way to test for potency is to start with one portion of a serving, wait one to two hours, then make an informed decision on whether to consume more. Always dose carefully and listen to your body, and never drive under the influence of cannabis.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/22160114/raspberry-bar.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/raspberry-cough-bars-recipe"}],"reviewCount":81,"flavors":[{"name":"Berry","score":55.208333333333329},{"name":"Sweet","score":36.75595238095238},{"name":"Strawberry","score":17.261904761904759},{"name":"Apple","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Earthy","score":13.988095238095237}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":76.488095238095241},{"name":"Euphoric","score":53.125},{"name":"Relaxed","score":47.470238095238088},{"name":"Talkative","score":43.1547619047619},{"name":"Uplifted","score":41.81547619047619}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":32.44047619047619},{"name":"Depression","score":30.208333333333329},{"name":"Fatigue","score":14.583333333333332},{"name":"Pain","score":13.244047619047619},{"name":"Nausea","score":10.56547619047619}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":29.613095238095234},{"name":"Migraines","score":4.0178571428571423},{"name":"Multiple Sclerosis","score":4.0178571428571423},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.0178571428571423},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":3.7202380952380953}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":7.4404761904761907},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":6.1011904761904763},{"name":"Dizzy","score":4.6130952380952381},{"name":"Anxious","score":3.7202380952380953},{"name":"Headache","score":3.4226190476190474}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/sativa/raspberry-cough/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/sativa/raspberry-cough/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_ceed.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/596653/b/raspberry-cough__primary_b7b6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_9a50.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/577694/b/raspberry-cough__primary_7078.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_9dd4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/577692/b/raspberry-cough__primary_2395.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_92c0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/558350/b/raspberry-cough__primary_e8ca.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_7f0d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/545837/b/raspberry-cough__primary_26fd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_30bc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/509934/b/raspberry-cough__primary_031b.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":19,"popularCities":["Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Vancouver, BC","Denver, CO","Detroit, MI","Hamilton, ON","Huntington, OR","Louisville, CO","Ottawa, ON","Portland, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/raspberry-cough","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.40740740740741/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Ice","subtitle":null,"slug":"ice","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/ice","symbol":"Ice","applink":"leafly://strain/ice"},{"name":"Cambodian","subtitle":null,"slug":"cambodian","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/cambodian","symbol":"Cmb","applink":"leafly://strain/cambodian"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":65,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tAroma is best brought out when grown outdoors with organic fertilizers\n\tSuitable for sea of green (SOG) method\n\n"}}

Offering a fragrant nose of sweet fruit and berry, it has a a pleasant dusty, green herbal flavor that is not noticeably cannabis in character, but can be a bit harsh in the throat, and as its name implies, expands noticeably in the lungs if too much is taken in.  The aftertaste is long, with an interesting note of toasted grain.\r\n\r\nThe rush, which does not manifest immediately, builds steadily, offering a strong cerebral buzz that is well-balanced by equal body that can be tingly as well as sensual.  Very stoney and exceptionally long, it provides a decidedly mellow and quite pleasant sense of well-being.  One of if not the best strains I\u0027ve had to date. Well worth seeking out.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1587464,"username":"highsam97","text":"Cough strains have such great flavor -- this one tastes like raspberries and cream.

The flavor profiles will be even sweeter if you can find a Raspberry Cough strain that was flushed with brown sugar or molasses before harvesting.\nThese Raspberry Cough Bars, which are also gluten free, can be enjoyed at any time of the day and will crush a sweet tooth craving in an instant. The Raspberry Cough strain creates an alert-minded yet peaceful state of awareness when consumed. It is perfect for treating depression, motivating a tired body, reducing anxiety, and centering the spirit.\nPlan on spending time outdoors doing physical activities such as trail hiking, snowboarding, or running? Then this edible will do the trick for you. On the other side of the coin, the hybrid properties are also great for staying at home and defragmenting your thoughts through meditation; cleaning the house; or enjoying your favorite meal with friends.\nEnjoy a bar with your favorite cup of coffee or tea, and let the terpenes of this treat inspire your senses!\nRaspberry Cough Cannabis-Infused Bars\nStart to finish: 1 hour (active: 10 minutes)\nYields: 12 bars (or 6 larger bars)\nApproximate dosage: 30 milligrams*\nBar ingredients:\n\n1 cup organic gluten free flour\n1 cup organic gluten free rolled oats\n3/4 cup reduced sugar organic raspberry jam\n1/2 cup Raspberry Cough-infused organic raw coconut oil, at room temperature\n1/2 cup organic light brown sugar\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/8 teaspoon Himalayan pink sea salt\n\n\nCrumb topping ingredients:\n\n3/4 cup organic gluten free flour\n1/2 cup non-infused raw coconut oil, at room temperature\n1/2 cup organic sugar\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n\nDirections:\n\nPreheat your oven to 350˚F and grease an 8-inch square pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt.\nMix all the dry ingredients together until fully incorporated, then add the Raspberry Cough-infused coconut oil.\nUse your hands or the back of a large wooden spoon to blend the dry ingredients into the raw coconut oil until it becomes a crumb mixture.\nPress this mixture into the bottom of your greased pan, making sure the mixture remains level within the pan. Using another spoon or spatula, spread the raspberry jam on top, getting it as close to the edge of the crumb bar base as possible without touching the walls of the pan.\nIn another bowl, combine your crumb topping ingredients: flour, sugar, coconut oil, and cinnamon (this adds a little warmth and spice). Stir all the ingredients until fully integrated into a crumbly topping.\nTake your crumb topping and sprinkle it evenly over the raspberry jam.\nPlace in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes or until the top is lightly browned. Cool completely before cutting into either 6 large bars or 12 small ones.\n\nNotes:\n\nOn dosing: If one gram of Raspberry Cough that you use to make the cooking oil tests at 20% THC, twenty percent of 1,000mg would be 200mg. So if you used three grams of this strain at 20% THC, the recipe would theoretically contain 600mg total, or 50mg in each of 12 bars (sub the THC percentage of your own cannabis and do the same math to figure out your own theoretical dosage). That said, there are myriad chemical reactions that can reduce the potency of your cooking oil along the way, so the bars will likely contain decidedly less than that – probably closer to 30 milligrams. Always sample a small portion of one serving first and wait a couple hours to see how it affects you before consuming more.\nOn altering the dosage: If you want a smaller dose, either cut the cannabis down to a smaller amount or cut your bars into 24 servings instead of 12. If you want a higher dose, add more Raspberry Cough or cut the bars into six servings.\nOn strain substitutions: I would recommend strains that possess fruity terpenes, which will pair well with the flavors of raspberry and the bar itself. If you don’t have Raspberry Cough, either Fruity Pebbles, Haze Berry, Juicy Fruit, or Cindy 99 will do the trick. If you can’t find any of these strains, don’t panic! Just follow your nose and taste buds to select strains that would complement the dish. Have fun with it!\n\n*Note: The amount of infused coconut oil specified in this recipe is a very loose suggestion; the actual amount you use should be modified based on the strength of your oil and the potency you desire. Dosing homemade edibles can be tricky (click here to learn why), so the best way to test for potency is to start with one portion of a serving, wait one to two hours, then make an informed decision on whether to consume more. Always dose carefully and listen to your body, and never drive under the influence of cannabis.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/22160114/raspberry-bar.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/raspberry-cough-bars-recipe"}],"reviewCount":81,"flavors":[{"name":"Berry","score":55.208333333333329},{"name":"Sweet","score":36.75595238095238},{"name":"Strawberry","score":17.261904761904759},{"name":"Apple","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Earthy","score":13.988095238095237}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":76.488095238095241},{"name":"Euphoric","score":53.125},{"name":"Relaxed","score":47.470238095238088},{"name":"Talkative","score":43.1547619047619},{"name":"Uplifted","score":41.81547619047619}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":32.44047619047619},{"name":"Depression","score":30.208333333333329},{"name":"Fatigue","score":14.583333333333332},{"name":"Pain","score":13.244047619047619},{"name":"Nausea","score":10.56547619047619}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":29.613095238095234},{"name":"Migraines","score":4.0178571428571423},{"name":"Multiple Sclerosis","score":4.0178571428571423},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":4.0178571428571423},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":3.7202380952380953}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":7.4404761904761907},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":6.1011904761904763},{"name":"Dizzy","score":4.6130952380952381},{"name":"Anxious","score":3.7202380952380953},{"name":"Headache","score":3.4226190476190474}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(1397952000000)\/","thumb":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/sativa/raspberry-cough/primary?width=200","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/sativa/raspberry-cough/primary?width=1024"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_ceed.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/596653/b/raspberry-cough__primary_b7b6.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_9a50.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/577694/b/raspberry-cough__primary_7078.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_9dd4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/577692/b/raspberry-cough__primary_2395.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_92c0.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/558350/b/raspberry-cough__primary_e8ca.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_7f0d.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/545837/b/raspberry-cough__primary_26fd.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/raspberry-cough_100x100_30bc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/509934/b/raspberry-cough__primary_031b.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":19,"popularCities":["Calgary, AB","Montréal, QC","Vancouver, BC","Denver, CO","Detroit, MI","Hamilton, ON","Huntington, OR","Louisville, CO","Ottawa, ON","Portland, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/raspberry-cough","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.40740740740741/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Ice","subtitle":null,"slug":"ice","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/ice","symbol":"Ice","applink":"leafly://strain/ice"},{"name":"Cambodian","subtitle":null,"slug":"cambodian","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/cambodian","symbol":"Cmb","applink":"leafly://strain/cambodian"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":65,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":"\n\tAroma is best brought out when grown outdoors with organic fertilizers\n\tSuitable for sea of green (SOG) method\n\n"}}
