            "text": "The first thing you notice with this weed is the beautifully overwhelming smell of root beer. That's the only smell you get from it. Next is taste. I'm waiting for my vaporizer to arrive in the mail, so I did my first session with RB Kush through a pipe. I will do a re-review with the Vaporizer. Anyways, even from smoking, I sill got an unexpected surprise. I was expecting a nice root beer smell and more earthy tastes, I instead got the taste of amazing root beer. The toke starts off quite earthy, but when that dies off, each toke has a fantastic root beer finish taste. When smoking this, all of my saliva tasted like root beer. It was cool. The high from this is progressing. I actually write reviews when experiencing the product. So I'm 3 bowls in, and I'm feeling more mellowed out. I am a lighter weight smoker, so do take that into consideration. My face feels very heavy on the rest of my head. It's an extremely mellow, happy high. I can feel the body  high indica effects getting stronger. The becomes more mellow as I become more and more high. The body effects and the taste really mesh well for some reason. I am getting some more minor cotton mouth, but I think's it's because the rootbeer taste is making me salivate a lot.\n\nAnyways, this isn't the strongest weed out there, by any means. It gives you a decent functioning body high, that frees your mind for a bit and let's you explore things outside of the box. I would reccomend this strain for people suffering from anxiety or depression, and definitely for recreational users who want a very mellow, happy chill sesh with your buds or alone before bed. Solid 3.5/5.\n\nI WILL RE REVIEW WITH THE ASCENT VAPORIZER SOON.",
