I am a lighter weight smoker, so do take that into consideration. My face feels very heavy on the rest of my head. It\u0027s an extremely mellow, happy high. I can feel the body  high indica effects getting stronger. The becomes more mellow as I become more and more high. The body effects and the taste really mesh well for some reason.
