A taste similar to the smell that vaporizes to a thick vapor that isn\u0027t too rough, but coats your mouth. The taste alone has me coming back, but this strain is a complete package. A slightly energetic and euphoric high slowly kicks in and leads to a sense of comfort and relaxation, but this strain definitely shows its sativa side and is a great daytime medicine. Also seems to be a bit hard to find, so I suggest scooping it up when available. The flower is pretty dense and kiefy, and is a big sticky when broken up. Some light pain is under control, but not completely masked like some indica strains. Lastly, appetite does not seem to be increased with this strain, so I personally prefer it as an after-meal choice that gets you up and going but still leaves you down to earth and relaxed. A top shelf/ go to strain for this cannabis cabinet.
