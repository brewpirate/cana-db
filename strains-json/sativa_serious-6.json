Today the Cannabis Cup comes to an end. I think that it’s safe to say that all of the participants this year have presented some great products. From DNA Genetics, Paradise Seeds, and Green House to Serious Seeds and Big Buddha Seeds, everyone seemed to have brought their A-game.\nI would like to offer a sincere congratulations to the following cannabis companies for presenting incredible flower:\n\nGreen Place, winning first place coffeeshop flower for Rollex OG Kush;\nGreen House, winning second place coffeeshop flower for Flowerbomb Kush;\nand Bush Doctor Coffeeshop, winning third place for Tangie.\n\nWhile I was thoroughly impressed with the rock star strains such as Tangie and Flowerbomb Kush, I also was pleasantly surprised by Serious 6, a product of Switzerland-based Serious Seeds. What I found most striking about this sativa was its taste—a light, herbal, pleasant flavor that is a little challenging to describe. It wasn’t quite like anything that I have ever tasted before, and as a foodie wannabe, that’s a definite good quality in my book.\nHaving now gone through my first full Cannabis Cup, I am realizing that it is almost impossible to see everything and do everything you really wish you could. While spending time at the coffeeshops is a definite must, the seminars held today at the Cup were particularly fascinating. Hearing Ben Dronkers of Sensi Seeds talk about his accomplishments, new ventures, and how Sensi Seeds came to be was incredible. He put up a slideshow of old photos and as he looked at the old images, recalling each moment, you could feel for yourself the happiness of a life filled with great experiences and even better memories.\nSpending Thanksgiving at the Cannabis Cup is far from the holiday tradition, but spending the past five days around people filled with such energy and a never-ending love for what they do is something to be thankful for. I would like to take this time to say “thank you” to all of the wonderful people I have met this week, and to all of those in the cannabis industry who have worked to gain acceptance for this plant and share their passion with the world.\nIf you are intersted in learning about the winners in every High Times Cannabis Cup category, please click here.\nI hope you had a wonderful holiday,\nAnna\nP.S.

Today the Cannabis Cup comes to an end. I think that it’s safe to say that all of the participants this year have presented some great products. From DNA Genetics, Paradise Seeds, and Green House to Serious Seeds and Big Buddha Seeds, everyone seemed to have brought their A-game.\nI would like to offer a sincere congratulations to the following cannabis companies for presenting incredible flower:\n\nGreen Place, winning first place coffeeshop flower for Rollex OG Kush;\nGreen House, winning second place coffeeshop flower for Flowerbomb Kush;\nand Bush Doctor Coffeeshop, winning third place for Tangie.\n\nWhile I was thoroughly impressed with the rock star strains such as Tangie and Flowerbomb Kush, I also was pleasantly surprised by Serious 6, a product of Switzerland-based Serious Seeds. What I found most striking about this sativa was its taste—a light, herbal, pleasant flavor that is a little challenging to describe. It wasn’t quite like anything that I have ever tasted before, and as a foodie wannabe, that’s a definite good quality in my book.\nHaving now gone through my first full Cannabis Cup, I am realizing that it is almost impossible to see everything and do everything you really wish you could. While spending time at the coffeeshops is a definite must, the seminars held today at the Cup were particularly fascinating. Hearing Ben Dronkers of Sensi Seeds talk about his accomplishments, new ventures, and how Sensi Seeds came to be was incredible. He put up a slideshow of old photos and as he looked at the old images, recalling each moment, you could feel for yourself the happiness of a life filled with great experiences and even better memories.\nSpending Thanksgiving at the Cannabis Cup is far from the holiday tradition, but spending the past five days around people filled with such energy and a never-ending love for what they do is something to be thankful for. I would like to take this time to say “thank you” to all of the wonderful people I have met this week, and to all of those in the cannabis industry who have worked to gain acceptance for this plant and share their passion with the world.\nIf you are intersted in learning about the winners in every High Times Cannabis Cup category, please click here.\nI hope you had a wonderful holiday,\nAnna\nP.S.
