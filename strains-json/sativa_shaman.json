            "text": "This is a strain that is a lot stronger than I thought,estimated around 14%. Personally I had this strain over thirty years ago, this is the original purple skunk. I grew this myself and I have to say that this strain does purple, some more so than others, I have three plants at 4 and half foot tall. They are bushy and an indoor grow, the smell is not strong, the flavor tastes like hard candies which is nice, the smoke is extremely smooth. The high itself is great for focus, very pleasant with no paranoia. This strain is a creeper and will daze you, afterwards enjoy a smooth uplifting energetic high that lasts anywhere between 3 to 6 hours.",
