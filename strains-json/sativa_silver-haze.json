            "text": "Summer 2017\u2019s total solar eclipse is America\u2019s celestial event of the century. The first eclipse to fully cross the contiguous United States since 1918, it will mobilize millions of travelers on (and to) the North American continent. Happily, the eclipse has decided to include a rec-legal state in its path of totality.\nAs many as a million visitors are expected in Oregon alone on August 21st, and a good many of them will be marveling at the solar phenomenon in an elevated state of mind. The following are three strains and three products we recommend for viewing the event, as well as three pieces of advice for getting high while the world goes dark.\n\nBest Cannabis Strains for Viewing the Eclipse\nSunset Sherbet \nThe name alone brings this one to mind right away, but its effervescent cerebral effects and feel-good full body high are what make this strain a perfect eclipse-viewing pick. The indica-leaning hybrid is potent but won\u2019t put you under, and offers a jolt of imaginative energy that will have you in awe over everything going on up above.\nMt. Hood Magic\nAn Oregon-born hybrid cross between Durban Poison and Northern Lights #5, Mt. Hood Magic can be found in Portland, Seaside, and Bend, and begets a bubbly, euphoric, social high and a delectable dose of citrusy flavor. If you want to get extra-local, this is your pick\u2014just be sure to check whether the dispensary you\u2019re hitting will have it, as it\u2019s rarer than either Sunset Sherbet or Super Silver Haze.\nSuper Silver Haze\nThis earthy sativa is the perfect way to fully appreciate the natural beauty of the eclipse\u2014as a Haze, it\u2019ll leave you feeling happy yet relaxed and fully at peace with the world around you. Where Mt. Hood Magic can be tricky to track down, Super Silver Haze products and pre-rolls are everywhere, so you can definitely find this strain no matter where you end up watching the event.\n\nBest Cannabis Products for the Eclipse\nD!PPER by Dipstick Vapes\nYou\u2019ll be camped out ready to watch the eclipse for awhile (it starts coming on around 9:00 a.m. and reaches totality right about 10:20), so you\u2019ll want something portable with a solid battery life. This concentrate vape is the way to go: It includes a unique Vapor Tip Atomizer attachment for actual dabs, or a Quartz Crystal Atomizer that can be loaded in a more traditional manner. Remember to clean it out thoroughly if you\u2019ll be flying home\u2014no transporting cannabis across state lines.\nWana Jewels\nThere\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be near a ton of people while you\u2019re watching, so be considerate with smoke, vapor, and smells, particularly if you\u2019re around families. Edibles are the most discreet way to do it. We recommend low-dose edibles so you can slowly tailor your high to the perfect level as the eclipse comes on. Wana Jewels are delicious and ideal for this kind of dosing, as they contain less than 2mg per candy.\nMary\u2019s Medicinals Transdermal Gel Pen\nThis purchase is an investment in comfort\u2014you\u2019re going to be craning your neck for hours watching the sun. A transdermal topical is the perfect thing to have on hand: Rub it between your wrists for a subtle mental buzz, or massage a few pumps into your neck for localized relief and minimal psychoactive effects.\n\nAdvice for Watching the Eclipse While High\nBe wary of dry eyes.\nSmoking or vaping in particular can cause them, which won\u2019t make for an enjoyable viewing experience. Solution: Stay hydrated, bring eye drops, and if you want to be extra-careful, close your eyes when you exhale a lungful of smoke or vapor. And speaking of eyes, don\u2019t forget your shades\u2014meaning eclipse viewing glasses, which you\u2019ll need to safely look at the sky (no, regular sunglasses won\u2019t work).\nPack a survival kit.\nInclude munchies, water, eye drops, sunscreen, an extra lighter, those eclipse viewing glasses, a camera or your phone, a blanket, a pillow\u2014and don\u2019t forget your cannabis. It\u2019s far better to be over-prepared than under-prepared. Speaking of preparedness, set multiple alarms on the morning of the eclipse, and stake out your preferred viewing location in advance.\nMake a trip of it.\nWant to spend more than a day in Oregon? Good plan, because trying to arrive at a viewing location anywhere close to Monday morning is going to be your worst nightmare in terms of traffic (we\u2019re talking standstills, not a crawl). What to do: Check out our complete Oregon cannabis road trip itinerary, which zig-zags between the state\u2019s cannabis hubs before ending up in the path of totality in time for the eclipse. That way, if untimely clouds ruin your viewing plans, you\u2019ll still have had a fantastic time in this beautiful state.",

            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Silver Haze brought the beauty of Haze genetics to new heights by breeding in Northern Lights to increase the yield and quality of buds. This Haze-dominant strain now produces yields that made it financially worthwhile. Known for its cerebral sativa high, Silver Haze also offers a sweet and woody aroma.\nGrow Techniques: Try growing this strain indoors with a hydroponic setup using the SOG (sea of green) method. It can be switched to flowering early on as it will stretch quite a bit. This strain responds well to training methods and can be packed in closely with other plants without causing problems.\nFlowering Time: 10 to 12 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Responds well to dry, warm climates between 70 and 80 degrees.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Silver Haze grows well indoors or outdoors given the right climate. It does exceptionally well indoors for a sativa strain.\u00a0\nFeeding: Be careful to not overfeed this sativa-dominant plant. If growing hydroponically, keep the EC (electrical conductivity) low to start off, and slowly increase as you pay attention to the effects the nutrients have on the plant.",

Two hits off of this strain and it left me feeling numb with a full body high. I was at my friends house who lives only a couple streets over so about a 10 minute walk. What should have been a 10 minute walk was around a 40 minute walk. If you are tired and/or experiencing any sort of head or muscle pain then this is definitely the strain to remedy it.... One last thing, I found myself getting pretty hungry part way through my high so you might want to have something to munch on :).",
