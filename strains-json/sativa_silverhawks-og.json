One of the better smelling strains I have come across. I usually like SSH crosses, and this is one of the best ones that I have had. Hits me right away, and then builds in intensity. This is a great focused high, with moderate pain relief. ",

            "text": "Time for another of my Strain Reviews !  This new strain was brought to me by my Great Mohawk Friends !\n\n Silverhawks OG is a mix of Super Silver Haze x White Fire Alien OG and it's a 75% Sativa vs. 25% Indica.  This super Dank Cannabis is really surprising to me as it has a definite Diesel odour to the freshly ground herb, and I have steered clear of Diesels the past 18 years as I had an ex friend who crossed tonnes of strains with Diesel and all his 'herb' caused me nothing but screeching migraines every time I was at his place.  \n\nBut I have rarely been surprised like this as the Diesel does not over power the strain and actually adds nuance to the flavonoids.  And is more present in the exhale than in the actual favour profile.\n\nI have of recent been using considerably more Sativa's than Indica's for Chronic Pain Managing and the Sativa's are offering me alot more than the Powerful Sedative effects of Most of the Indica Strains I have.\n\nWhat I truly enjoy about this strain is that it has fabulous Citrus Flavonoids that keep coming with each inhalation.",
