            "text": "Wow.  I was looking for a strain with lots of cerebral, even psychedelic, effects and I definitely found it here. I searched my nearest dispensaries for either Blue Dream or Master Kush, since they are said to have the type of high I was looking for. Couldn't find either one in stock at my usual places, so I took a chance on this hybrid of the two.\n\nI'm a moderate to heavy user (every other night or every third night is typical for me) and I don't go in for an easy body high or a light experience.  If I don't feel like I'm existing in multiple dimensions at once, I don't see the point, so I really go all in. All that's to say that I'm no stranger to getting high and I have a pretty good handle on how much it takes to get me to the right level.\n\nThe first time I used Sky Master, I tried three or four puffs on my vaporizer and it quickly launched me straight past \"the right level\" and into a whole new experience. This was not necessarily a good thing, as I was in an unfamiliar place at the time and wasn't well prepared for a really trippy session. Well, as I had been searching for a strain with strong psychedelic effects, I knew immediately that I had found it with Sky Master. I often  combine vaping with a 10-mg edible, too, so I can keep it going for longer, but in vaping less than I usually do and using no edibles, I was experiencing things cannabis had never done to me before. It was easily more potent an experience than my first-ever time using cannabis, so...yeah. This strain means business. I had to talk myself out of believing that my mind was going to totally shatter and I wouldn't come out of the Sky Master experience with my personality intact.\n\nThankfully, that was not the case. I'm just fine, and since then Sky Master and I have become very good friends. I definitely need to use a lot less of this strain than I do any other strain I've tried, but the high is pretty spectacular if you like a very \"up,\" creative, mind-expanding experience. It's such a unique feeling; hard to describe, as all I can really think to call it is consciousness- and awareness-expanding to some distant reaches. This one will be on my list of favorite strains for good, I think! Kudos to Sky Master's breeder for a real botanical achievement.\n\nI still haven't tried either of the parent strains yet...darn.",
