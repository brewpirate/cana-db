            "text": "Cresco did it again with this cross - OMG.  Sojay Haze reminds me of opening up a really nice bottle of Pinot Noir - awesome fruity undertones with a dash of floral earthiness.  Medium-bodied, of course.  Seriously though, this strain has great mid-density buds that really glisten in the light with frost.  The smoke provides and brilliant uplifting and energetic high with a good amount of headiness/euphoria.  Perfect daytime smoke for both the beginner and the battle tested cannabis consumer.  Keep them coming, Cresco!",
