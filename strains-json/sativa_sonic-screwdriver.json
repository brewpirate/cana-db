Now I usually don\u0027t smoke sativas but I got this strain reviewed to me by the bud tender for Anxiety and depression as I\u0027m going through one of the worse bouts of my life. \n(A little irritated at that bud tender though, as it caused a lot of positive introspective, it still left my mind buzzing and thinking to fast, and caused some anxiety, should\u0027ve recommended me  a high CBD as if was a god send) \n75% sativa \nNot much to say about it tbh, your typical high leaning land race sativa. But super Stoney and euphoric, lots of positive introspective and a euphoric buzz and it won\u0027t leave you couch locked\n7.2/10","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"},{"id":1543722,"username":"nickdorazioo","text":"I haven\u0027t been able to find this strain anywhere anymore but let me say this strain was amongst the best bud I have ever smoked in my life. 1 bowl and I can feel the high seeping into my body.
