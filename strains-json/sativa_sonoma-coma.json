            "text": "For some cannabis consumers, the \u201cmunchies,\u201d or appetite stimulation, is an unwanted side effect that can lead to overeating, but for many medical marijuana patients, it provides necessary relief from symptoms like nausea and a lack of appetite. For those of you who consume cannabis as a natural appetite stimulant or to help calm gastrointestinal distress, here are 10 of the many strain varieties that can help kick-start the grumbles in your tummy:\n Goo\nGoo is a fairly heavy indica, so don\u2019t test this strain unless you\u2019re prepared for a strong dose of relaxation with your appetite boost. It also offers relief from painful muscle spasms, making it a good choice for spasticity or for those who suffer from gastrointestinal disorders.\n Monster Cookies\nAnother potent indica, Monster Cookies hails from the favored GSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies) tribe and offers the same dose of euphoria and relaxation you know and love. The sleepy effects will increase over time, so keep your couch and your munchies close at hand and you\u2019ll be set for the night.\n Maui Bubble Gift\nMaui Bubble Gift is an aromatic hybrid with roots in three distinctively fantastic medicinal strains: Bubble Gum, Maui Waui and God\u2019s Gift. This indica-dominant strain has an unusually high CBD content, which makes it an excellent choice for pain and nausea sufferers. With the mental clarity of Maui Waui, the stomach-soothing spasm relief of Bubble Gum, and the relaxing effects of God\u2019s Gift, this hybrid offers the best of three worlds in one.\n Sonoma Coma\nSonoma Coma is a rare sativa that hails from (where else?) Sonoma County, California. It offers energetic, uplifting effects with a mellow finish and a dash of the munchies to aid a diminished appetite.\n Platinum Purple Kush\nPurple Kush\u2019s beefed-up older brother, Platinum Purple Kush provides deep muscle relaxation while still maintaining clarity and focus, making it one of the \u201clighter\u201d indicas on our list. It has been known to make consumers \u201ccrazy hungry,\u201d so make sure to have some noms on hand.\n Orange Skunk\nA citrus infusion with a clear-headed high, Orange Skunk relieves depression and anxiety in addition to a lack of appetite. With a myriad of effects, this strain can help relieve multiple symptoms, including inflammation, headaches, even pain and fibromyalgia.\n Gigabud\nThis indica-dominant hybrid is known to be expressly excellent for inducing an appetite, even among those with the most intense stomach symptoms. For those with nausea, weight loss, and issues with the digestive tract, Gigabud ought to be a staple for relief and to encourage a \u201cravenous\u201d appetite.\n Caramelo\nThis sativa-dominant hybrid has indica origins in the Lavender family, offering an uplifting buzz without paranoia, along with potent pain and nausea relief. While Caramelo is an energetic strain useful for daytime consumption, be forewarned: the effects may be short-lived, so you may require a stronger strain for longtime symptom management.\n Pure Kush\nTrue to its name, Pure Kush is one of the purest, most potent indicas you\u2019ll encounter. Watch out because this strain will knock you out like Mike Tyson if you\u2019re not careful. Place your pizza orders before you dose or you may have trouble peeling yourself up off the couch to even get to the kitchen, which just seems\u2026.so far away\u2026.\n Diablo\nContrary to its name, this devilish strain is a kinder, gentler indica than many on this list. While couchlock is still a potential side effect, Diablo will allow you the focus and mental capacity to tackle day-to-day life without too much trouble, although you may need to watch out for a case of the giggles.\nStill looking for an appetite stimulant?

We've highlighted\u00a0five\u00a0that made the cut, but you can browse many other newly added varieties\u00a0in the Explorer.\nLeave a review if you've already had a chance to indulge in one of these newcomers!\n\u00a0 \u00a01. Lucid Dream\nCharacteristics of Lucid Dream:\n\nLucid Dream is a dynamic blend of Amnesia Haze\u00a0and\u00a0Blue Dream. This sativa-dominant hybrid provides a stimulating mix of uplifting Haze\u00a0effects with the sweet blueberry notes of Blue Dream. Lucid Dream's energetic, uplifting buzz makes it a great daytime choice for patients treating migraines,\u00a0nausea, and stress.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a02. Night Terror OG\nCharacteristics of Night Terror OG:\n\nNight Terror OG is what you get when you combine Blue Dream with Rare Darkness #1 genetics. This cleverly named hybrid sways heavily toward the indica side of the spectrum, inducing relaxing effects that sink deeper in the body over time. You may find your eyelids feeling heavy before long, but don\u2019t let a name like Night Terror OG fool you: a good night\u2019s sleep is on its way. This 70% indica isn\u2019t necessarily a day-ender, as the OG Kush in Rare Darkness genes provides a heady, invigorating buzz that deteriorates stress at the end of a long day. These effects are ushered in by flavors of blueberry and fruit with subtle notes of lemon, pine, and diesel.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a03. Sonoma Coma\nCharacteristics of Sonoma Coma:\n\nSonoma Coma sprouted in Sonoma County, California and presents itself with tight, electric green buds which produce a thick coat of trichomes that sparkle in the sunlight. Contrary to what the name implies, Sonoma Coma is actually an energetic, uplifting sativa. The genetics remain a closely guarded recipe but are impressive enough to claim the prize for 1st place Sativa at the 2012 High Times Medical Cannabis Cup in Los Angeles. A complex mixture of sweet tropical fruits and spiced, woody undertones combine to give Sonoma Coma its distinct aroma. The flavor maintains the aroma\u2019s complex characteristics but provides a smooth mellow finish. True to its sativa heritage, Sonoma Coma produces an energetic invasion of heady effects that produce bursts of creativity and euphoria. This strain is also known to induce a case of the munchies, so it makes a great remedy to a diminished appetite.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Soul Assassin OG\nCharacteristics of Soul Assassin OG:\n\nSoul Assassin OG is an OG Kush variety bred by the Soul Assassins Crew, a collective of musicians and artists affiliated with the hip hop group Cypress Hill. While the genetics remain unclassified, there have been rumblings through the underground that Lemon Thai is the mistress responsible for influencing OG Kush into its Soul Assassin OG offspring. It is an indica-dominant hybrid that produces smooth, expansive smoke with and aroma of pungent diesel and citrus fumes. Soul Assassin OG evokes sleepy, knockout indica effects that help silence any pain, stress, or tension from a long a day.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a05. Americano\nCharacteristics of Americano:\n\nAmericano is a Canadian strain released by Enterprise Seeds. It is a Northern Lights/Skunk hybrid that is named for the American consumers it was designed to attract. When tourists, notably Americans, came to Vancouver looking to purchase bulk cannabis, they wanted their buds to have \u201cbag appeal\u201d \u2013 or stunning visual characteristics that made it easy to sell. Americano is known for its heavy coat of trichomes and its thick dense colas. The flavors and aromas of Americano stay true to its Skunk lineage and produce a sweet, piney musk. The effects are exactly what you would expect from an indica-driven hybrid: fast-acting, relaxing, and sleepy. Americano is a solid answer to symptoms of insomnia, headaches, and chronic pain.",

Green with lots of light crystals and orange hairs. The smell is subtlety sour. Not as sour as others like Lamb's Bread, but still very good to the nose to the point you can't wait to try it out like McD's fries.\r\n\r\nWhen I smoked it, it was a very good Sativa head high. I was watching football most sf the day and this made the games all the more enjoyable! I was having a lot of fun with this stuff. It elevated my spirits and mood very well. It intensified my happiness while watching football (along with a Niners win). This is a very good strain to have when in social situations since it will make everything much more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nLater on in the day I kept smoking it and it just kinda got me glued to my bed with a big smile on my face. So yea, it does get stoney, but at least you'll still be smiling!",
