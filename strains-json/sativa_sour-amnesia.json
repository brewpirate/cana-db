It smelt like a box of Sour Nerds candy and looked like something you would have found in a secret prototype room at Willy Wonka's factory. \n\nThe effects of this particular strain are some of the best I have ever felt; I was relaxed, lucid, stress free and surprisingly cheery.  It lifted my depression away like a veil had been lifted upon exhaling. \n\nSuperb smoke -- flavours were quite exquisite and you could tell this was something special before it even hit you. \n\nI would highly recommend this strain to anyone, even people with anxiety problems as I myself am extremely sensitive to anything that could induce paranoia or anxiety.  This strain had me \nfeeling like a yogi on Valium or something\n\n10/10 for sure.\n",
