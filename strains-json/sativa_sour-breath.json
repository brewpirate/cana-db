I smoked a gram in a joint and that was more than enough to get me anxious as hell. I smoked .5g in a joint the next day and I still had some pretty overwhelming anxiety. I can deal with anxiety but this stuff can really kick it into overdrive.\n\nI have pre-existing anxiety and because of that, this strain is not for me. I can smoke anxiety-inducing strains but it's always a coin toss on whether or not I'll be able to handle it and this one is definitely a no for me.",
