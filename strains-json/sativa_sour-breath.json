I smoked a gram in a joint and that was more than enough to get me anxious as hell. I smoked .5g in a joint the next day and I still had some pretty overwhelming anxiety. I can deal with anxiety but this stuff can really kick it into overdrive.\n\nI have pre-existing anxiety and because of that, this strain is not for me. I can smoke anxiety-inducing strains but it\u0027s always a coin toss on whether or not I\u0027ll be able to handle it and this one is definitely a no for me.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1627831,"username":"calitorrez","text":"Party weed with energética and fun high ","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":11,"flavors":[{"name":"Earthy","score":31.25},{"name":"Tree Fruit","score":25},{"name":"Pungent","score":25},{"name":"Diesel","score":12.5},{"name":"Apricot","score":12.5}],"effects":[{"name":"Creative","score":81.25},{"name":"Focused","score":75},{"name":"Happy","score":75},{"name":"Uplifted","score":68.75},{"name":"Energetic","score":68.75}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":37.5},{"name":"Stress","score":37.5},{"name":"Cramps","score":25},{"name":"Fatigue","score":25},{"name":"Insomnia","score":12.5}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":31.25},{"name":"Arthritis","score":25},{"name":"PTSD","score":25},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":12.5},{"name":"PMS","score":6.25}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":43.75},{"name":"Anxious","score":31.25},{"name":"Paranoid","score":25},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":12.5}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-breath_100x100_7064.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/1002169/b/sour-breath__primary_20dd.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":1,"popularCities":["Gold Bar, WA","Seattle, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/sour-breath","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.36363636363636/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Sour Diesel","subtitle":null,"slug":"sour-diesel","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/sour-diesel","symbol":"Sd","applink":"leafly://strain/sour-diesel"},{"name":"Lamb\u0027s Bread","subtitle":null,"slug":"lamb-s-bread","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/lamb-s-bread","symbol":"Lb","applink":"leafly://strain/lamb-s-bread"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
