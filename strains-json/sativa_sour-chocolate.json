This and the 3 pronged red hairs are a sign of NJs ECSD cut. When you look closern you see that its ugly flakeyness is also its beauty. Neither parent is overly pretty, but this strain was bred for flavor and effects.\nSmell/Taste: Heres were the fun starts and over whelming whiff of classic ECSD kerosene diesel with a sweet n sour choclate twist, indescribable, but you know its what happens when chocolate and diesel weed flavors combine. The exhale is almost backwards, leading with a strong thick sour chocolate taste followed by a distinct kerosene finish. One of my favorite flavor strains, has me smoking more than i want just to taste it again.\nEffects: A little story behind this strain, in NJ its a pheno of chocolope  know for a extremly creamy chocolate flavor profile but high that only lasts about 30mins. They crossed this with the NJ East Coast Sour Diesel cut,giving us a super energetic cerebral sativa. The head rush is so strong it can be overwhelming for vets, this passes after about 30mins and settles into a super chill trippy feeling, very spaced out.Despite the energy brought with this strain and 0 couchlock, dont plan on getting much done, everytime i smoke it i end up staring at a wall after a half hour.\nOne NJs Up and coming strains. Once they find a more visually pleasing pheno you will be seeing this on the west coast, dont pass it up.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1307638,"username":"Gallucci","text":"Dabs from stash brothers has the flavor of soap\nNot good","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/1/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":10,"flavors":[{"name":"Diesel","score":3.3333333333333335},{"name":"Sweet","score":3.3333333333333335},{"name":"Earthy","score":3.3333333333333335},{"name":"Pungent","score":1.6666666666666667},{"name":"Coffee","score":1.6666666666666667}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":10},{"name":"Sleepy","score":6.666666666666667},{"name":"Creative","score":6.666666666666667},{"name":"Happy","score":6.666666666666667},{"name":"Talkative","score":5}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Insomnia","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Stress","score":6.666666666666667},{"name":"Fatigue","score":5},{"name":"Nausea","score":3.3333333333333335},{"name":"Pain","score":3.3333333333333335}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":3.3333333333333335},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":1.6666666666666667}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":5},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":3.3333333333333335},{"name":"Headache","score":3.3333333333333335},{"name":"Dizzy","score":1.6666666666666667}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-chocolate_100x100_e70a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/411302/b/sour-chocolate__primary_8d4e.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/sour-chocolate_100x100_ad27.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/51056/b/sour-chocolate_825x550_09db.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Los Angeles, CA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/sour-chocolate","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/3.9/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
