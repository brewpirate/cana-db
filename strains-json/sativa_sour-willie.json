            "text": "I personally use this strain during the day because its a 75/25 sativa/indica hybrid that is much easier to function with than its high THC % indica counterparts. It helps with crohn's disease to an extent - but not strong enough to eat a large portion of food. Tastes great, best when vaped, and also reeks when smoking or vaping, like across the backyard with a pipe level of smelliness. The head high is hard to think with sometimes, but I feel rightfully medicated the entire time. Definitely worth trying if you need  a sativa and want to experiment with a hybrid.",

            "text": "Picked this up at PARC dispensary in Phoenix, one of my absolute favorite dispensaries. They informed me that they were working with a new grower named DIRTY GIRL, run exclusively by women. I just had to try some, as sour D is one of my all time faves, Willie Nelson is a weed wizard, and I'm all about Women's lib (only straight, white males, such as myself, would feel the need to include that last bit) \n\nI opened the bag to discover giant,  beautiful, kief covered buds, the density of which blew my mind. I was surprised to crack open a large, healthy looking stem, with a milky white center. \n\nI just could not believe how \"meh\" this high was. I mean nothing, nothing at all. Honestly, everything about this flower would indicate an experienced grow, yet something is simply not there. \n\nI'd like to try more strains by DIRTY GIRL to get a better understanding of why I may have had this experience.
