            "text": "I decided to test this strain out on stress-induced migraines. My back was already hurting from doing some yardwork during the day (and I knew it works on pain), so I decided that the next time I started having a migraine, I would smoke some.\r\n\r\nWell, today was the day to test it. One of My acquaintances refused to be civil in a conversation, which raised My stress level to the point of causing a migraine. I went outside, had a little smoke, and within moments, My migraine pains were mellowed out (as were the rest of My pains).\r\n\r\nNow, if I were to take prescription medications for this, I would have to take one for My back, one for My leg, one for My head, one for My stomach, and another couple for the side effects caused by taking so many pills. This way, I smoke a bit, and lean back, maybe use some eye drops, drink some liquid refreshments, and I'm good.\r\n\r\nThis strain doesn't really give Me the desire to eat anything. I just want to drink something cold, and work on writing reviews or some arts and crafts or something. And I definitely do not want to deal with drama when I use this strain.\r\n\r\nThat, I like.",
