It\u2019s helped me out with a laundry list of symptoms: lack of appetite (kind of surprised with this one,but awesome to be hungry again \ud83d\ude0e), anxiety, stress, pain (RA, fibromyalgia, ankylosing spondylitis, strains, injuries), depression, nausea, and headache, seasonal allergies nasal symptoms (runny nose especially, Avitas\u2019 Dragon Berry is also awesome for runny nose and seasonal allergies, just a btw bcuz Leafly doesn\u2019t have a template for that strain yet\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd) \ud83d\ude0e great cerebral high, but not overwhelming to those who may be worried about paranoia symptoms Sativas can sometimes induce. As always, this is just what I\u2019ve experienced, everyone is different, I use many, many different strains medicinally (ugh...so many freakin health problems and only with the addition of cannabis...complimentary to my usual meds...\ud83d\udc4d for the last year straight has my health improvements astonished my health care providers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0e-> and for Recreation\ud83d\ude0e \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0d if you are lucky enough to have this strain",
