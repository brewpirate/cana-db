This strain hits the consumer square between the eyes with uplifting sativa stimulation and then cascades over the body with a subtle, vibrating warmth. Its aroma is mild&nbsp;but doesn&rsquo;t lack nuance, expressing notes of pine, cheese, and tartness. A latent chemical flavor rolls off the palate with a clean, earthy finish. Enjoy this strain to relieve stress, mute depression, and curb minor physical aches and pains.&nbsp;</p>\n",

It was like the traditional Chem aroma with a whole new level of pungency added.  The buds themselves were tight, dense, and dusted in amber trichomes like someone had left them on a shelf and forgotten about them.  The buds also had these really dark spots almost black that I've seen with chem before, these just took it to a new level. The high is where this really differed from traditional chem, It was very sativa dominant and slightly racy at times.  The kind of strain I'd smoke if I'm about to go hiking.  Also; we could not stop chatting, It will make your mind soar.  9/10",
