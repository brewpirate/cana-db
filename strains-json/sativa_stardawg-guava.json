Let me just say it will stink up your whole house in a matter of seconds.  It was like the traditional Chem aroma with a whole new level of pungency added.  The buds themselves were tight, dense, and dusted in amber trichomes like someone had left them on a shelf and forgotten about them.  The buds also had these really dark spots almost black that I\u0027ve seen with chem before, these just took it to a new level. The high is where this really differed from traditional chem, It was very sativa dominant and slightly racy at times.  The kind of strain I\u0027d smoke if I\u0027m about to go hiking.  Also; we could not stop chatting, It will make your mind soar.  9/10","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/Y7BSixzkNSIjwGyJmmVeYdOkdXM=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fgcfM1zHxS6e5qNX7cx4M_goggles-red.png"},{"id":1591061,"username":"coryst","text":"A relaxed, happy, and uplifting high that feels its way behind the eyes","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":30,"flavors":[{"name":"Tropical","score":71.969696969696983},{"name":"Pungent","score":59.659090909090907},{"name":"Earthy","score":55.3030303030303},{"name":"Sweet","score":17.8030303030303},{"name":"Chemical","score":8.3333333333333321}],"effects":[{"name":"Happy","score":128.59848484848484},{"name":"Relaxed","score":80.492424242424235},{"name":"Uplifted","score":79.73484848484847},{"name":"Euphoric","score":74.431818181818187},{"name":"Tingly","score":60.6060606060606}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":24.621212121212118},{"name":"Depression","score":22.348484848484844},{"name":"Pain","score":15.719696969696971},{"name":"Fatigue","score":14.772727272727273},{"name":"Eye Pressure","score":11.553030303030305}],"conditions":[{"name":"Migraines","score":60.416666666666671},{"name":"Anxiety","score":15.909090909090908},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":7.5757575757575744},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":7.3863636363636367},{"name":"PTSD","score":6.4393939393939394}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":57.575757575757571},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":7.3863636363636367},{"name":"Anxious","score":4.1666666666666661},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.083333333333333}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/stardawg-guava_100x100_448a.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/568234/b/stardawg-guava__primary_76ce.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/stardawg-guava_100x100_9b80.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/539317/b/stardawg-guava__primary_6569.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Denver, CO","Aurora, CO","Chicago, IL","Elmwood Park, IL","Fulton, IL","Grandview, IL","Litchfield, IL","Morris, IL","Oregon City, OR","Portland, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/stardawg-guava","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.6/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Chemdawg 4","subtitle":null,"slug":"chemdawg-4","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/chemdawg-4","symbol":"Cd4","applink":"leafly://strain/chemdawg-4"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
