            "text": "Special thanks to all of our Leafly users who nominated these strains to be included in the Leafly database! First up is Godzilla, a crushingly heavy indica that will maul stress, anxiety, and physical ailments like a giant, bipedal Japanese lizard. Punky Lion is similarly powerful, containing only indica genetics for maximum sedation and relief. Omega Dawg is a lighter 50/50 hybrid strain that won't leave you feeling so destroyed, but rather in the blissful space between full-body relaxation and dreamy bliss. Stella Blue is a mostly sativa strain that lifts your mood into the clouds, and Swazi Gold is a landrace sativa that has traveled all the way from Africa to bless our bowls with its presence.\nRemember to leave a review if you have the chance to enjoy one of these newcomers!\n\u00a0 \u00a01.

            "text": "This stuff is wonderful! Probably my favorite sativa. I'm prone to anxiety with strong sativas and tend to prefer hybrids, or else have to throw in a pinch of some indica to chill it out. Stella Blue is great by itself. It's a mellow, focused high that will perk you right up and make you want to do stuff. If you're not quite sure what to smoke and are worried the wrong choice will derail your plans, go with this one. You can be high as fuck and carry on a conversation with a sober person. Definitely a staple in our weed bar.",
