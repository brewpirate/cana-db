            "text": "Smoke:\r\nWe smoked it from a joint which was small and tightly wrapped. We didn't even need that much. Probably about .2 between 3 people was definitely enough. Shortly after we lit up we were squinting our eyes and laughing at jokes. I would recommend this for a day time smoke and definitely for an active schedule. Its definitely not tiring and am able to go about my daily business. \r\n\r\nTaste:\r\nThe taste is very sweet as you can imagine a strawberry would be and is very sweet tasting through a bong as well. \r\n\r\nLook:\r\nThese buds are very green with extremely orange hairs. The hairs are thick and all over. Tons of crystals lining the entirety of the leaves. Leaves are also very well grown and preserved within the denseness of them. \r\n",
