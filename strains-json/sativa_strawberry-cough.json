            "text": "Some people choose a cannabis strain based on its name. Others by its THC content. Personally, I\u2019m a sucker for aroma and flavor; whether it\u2019s a flower, dabbable wax, or an oil cartridge, bad/bland/harsh flavor is a big turn-off. And with flavors\u00a0ranging from sweet roses to earthy diesel, who wouldn\u2019t want to explore the vast spectrum of tastes and smells\u00a0cannabis has to offer?\n\nAlthough flavor has everything to do with how a product is grown, cured, stored, and processed, genetics play a role as well. Over the years, these strains have proven to be top contenders in the flavor game, consistently showing off rich terpene profiles that not only govern a strain\u2019s smell, but enhance the strain\u2019s effects as well.\n\nTangie is a citrus dream crafted by the masterminds at DNA Genetics. There\u2019s no strain I\u2019d sooner rely on for good flavor than this sativa; popping the lid of a jar of Tangie and filling your nose with the smell of fresh orange zest can be somewhat of a religious experience of wonderment. With the sweet smell of citrus and fruit medley, Tangie lets you drift upwards slowly and steadily into euphoria, where bad moods don\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nDominated by gassy, diesel notes you might be surprised to enjoy, GG4 (f.k.a Gorilla Glue #4)\u2019s aroma is balanced by sweet-and-sour skunk and refreshing pine. The smell of well-grown GG4 (f.k.a. Gorilla Glue #4) can completely conquer a room when opened, so if you\u2019re practicing discretion, consider holding off on GG4 until you reach open air.\n\n\nKyle Kushman never would have guessed that the sad-looking clone he held in a paper bag would one day become the famous award-winning Strawberry Cough. But thank goodness he passed this one to his left and shared the strawberry goodness with all of us. This uplifting, creative sativa strain smells like it grew wild in a strawberry patch, radiating with the distinct aroma of ripe berries and rich earthy soil.\n\nSpeaking of strains that smell exactly like fruit, this list would never be complete without the mention of Blueberry. Without Blueberry, there would be no Blue Dream, no Blue Cheese, no Blue Cookies; \u201cBlue\u201d hybrids simply wouldn\u2019t exist. You\u2019ll notice all of these strains carry a blueberry-like smell, but few can match the original Blueberry\u2019s uncanny resemblance to a bushel of overripe blueberries plucked straight from the branch.\n\n\nFlavors of lemon candy, sharp pine, and fresh herbs twist together to create the complex aroma of Dutch Treat. A budtender has never had to twist my arm when upselling Dutch Treat; it\u2019s been hard to find a lackluster example of the flavorful strain after all these years. Beyond the obvious notes of citrus and pine, this strain endlessly offers subtle nuances of sage, mint, and pepper.\n\nBursting with flavors of lemon, lime, and pear, XJ-13 is a strain I can hardly ever turn down. Its aroma has a sour bite that seems to almost fizzle in your nose like a fruity spritzer on a hot summer day.\n\nLavender is a beautifully intricate indica strain that smells like \u2013 oh, you guessed it \u2013 lavender. Like an all-in-one bouquet, Lavender also offers up sweet accents of wildflower, rose, and violet underneath a layer of woody earthiness.\n\n\nGrapefruit is a fantastic wake-and-bake strain not only because of its awakening, high-energy high, it also tastes like a bowl of ripe red grapefruit sweetened with honey. I don\u2019t often see it on dispensary shelves, but it\u2019s a cherished rarity, especially when enjoyed on warm summer weekend mornings.\n\nRed Headed Stranger is a strain I\u2019ve loved getting to know in both flower and oil form. Upon inhale, the palate is dowsed with sweet flavors that seem citrusy at first, but then you notice some of the quieter flavors of mint and pine giving the strain a fresh, herbaceous finish. Coupled with effects that soothe the body while letting the mind run unencumbered, Red Headed Stranger is a perfect afternoon smoke that can easily replace or enhance your favorite citrusy, hoppy beer.\n\n\nSchrom is somewhat of a local legend here in Seattle, but I simply can\u2019t find it in my heart to neglect mentioning this glorious sativa strain that\u00a0smells exactly like 7-Up. Herbal notes subtly underscore the pungent, unmistakable flavors of lemon-lime so strong, they monopolize the palate.\nThese are the strains that have been kindest to my nose, but what strains have a smell and/or flavor that make you swoon? Let me know what I\u2019m missing out on in the comments section below!",

Leafly and\u00a0General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: Strawberry Cough, created by Kyle Kushman, is a sativa-dominant strain that offers a distinct, award-winning strawberry smell and flavor. This fruity cannabis strain is uplifting and will provide you with mellow, motivating euphoria. Originally a clone-only strain, Strawberry Cough has since been worked into a similar seed form in the Netherlands.\nGrow Techniques: A quality plant to cultivate indoors, Strawberry Cough grows bushy on its own without training. Keep this low-maintenance plant happy by pruning away unnecessary foliage and providing a breeze through the canopy. Consider growing this strain in a soil garden with organic nutrients.\nFlowering Time: 9 weeks\nYield: High\nGrow Difficulty: Easy\nClimate: Strawberry Cough enjoys a warm climate with temperatures between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Protect Strawberry Cough from the cold by growing it indoors. If grown outside, warm temperatures at night will help keep this plant producing high-quality buds.\nFeeding: Basic nutrients should keep the plant happy and ready to produce its flavorful buds. Kyle Kushman highly recommends growing with organic nutrients to get the most out of Strawberry Cough.",

            "text": "This is my favorite strain and nothing else even compares. I have anxiety very often and this strain is one of the only strains that helps me with it. Strawberry cough (strawberry fields x haze) is the best tasting strain I have ever had ,and I am not joking or exaggerating when I say that. From the first inhalation I can taste the strawberry flavor that reminds me of the strawberry patches that grew at my childhood home. After the first hit the powerful high of haze kicks in and takes away any stress or anxiety I might be experiencing. The high is energetic and gets you moving not making you couch locked on the loveseat for hours. This strain has a lot of sativa genetics contained within so it is difficult for most indoor growers to grow properly. Due to this reason it is often difficult to find due to the legality of cannabis. Which is distasteful, because this strain is a gift that alleviates people's anxieties and fears and puts them to the wayside so that they can move on with their life and accomplish great things.",
