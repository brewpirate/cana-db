Like, a whole bowl by myself. Felt like my heart was going to explode and I would die. An hour or so later, the more I came down the more enjoyable it was. Did get pretty paranoid though. Was able to\nreason my way out of overreacting to  the paranoia most of the time. I laughed a little over the next few hours. felt tingly across my skin. Very lethargic breathing. Things seem to move slower around me. Snacked a little. Ate a few things. Then just layed on my couch and played Runescape lol. I currently feel very relaxed, heavy, slightly tingly on my arms and could take a nice nap.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sPaGuIbcIjKwcF8O7kQXXoAFJ6s=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fkfmswExdS0yqeEmdLkUQ_nerd-green.png"},{"id":1642491,"username":"bk127001","text":"Enjoyed this one as budder, very solid experience.
