Felt like my heart was going to explode and I would die. An hour or so later, the more I came down the more enjoyable it was. Did get pretty paranoid though. Was able to\nreason my way out of overreacting to  the paranoia most of the time. I laughed a little over the next few hours. felt tingly across my skin. Very lethargic breathing. Things seem to move slower around me. Snacked a little. Ate a few things. Then just layed on my couch and played Runescape lol. I currently feel very relaxed, heavy, slightly tingly on my arms and could take a nice nap.",
