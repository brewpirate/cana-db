The pain reliving effects buzz through my head in such a positive way, casting easy going vibrations for a nice hour...but hold the phones people , the best part of this strain my friend is that the high is so manageable . This doesn't take you on a head trip full of Aztec Wisdom and whispers of enlightenment while your peeking out of your window blinds hiding in your room paranoid that your wife will be home 5 hours early .. no..no.. Not this one , Sublime is so smooth I could do a job interview on it . Feeling calm, confident, inspired and pain free. This must be the strain Matthew Mconaughey tokes. One solid hit  and 10 minutes later I was feeling good in a boardroom meeting about some serious shit , but my ass was cool as a cucumber with great ideas. This flower is great for a day time high, try with a gulp of coffee ( by the way different coffee strains vary in there subtle effects... Experiment ) I recomend sublime with a French pressed Kona ..good morning",

I wouldn't exactly go for a drive while on this stuff, but it's a good one to puff up when you're about to play a board game or hang out with friends.\n\nThe flavors this thing has are what keep me coming back to it. It tastes a bit like pine, cinnamon, and sweet herbs. It almost tastes refined and dignified. One for the connoisseurs.",
