Got a qp of this (legit) and it quicky became one of my favs. I love the Sour and Haze familys, and the haze shines thru here. The batch i had smelled like berrys/plum/fruit. The smoke was a strong fruity taste similar to plum,thats over taken by the classic haze spicy/catpissy flavor at the end. The high is a strong euphoric ride that seems to last into the next day. You could be doing a task,hobby or sitting around staring at the wall, you will have a smile.No couchlock or drowsiness unless you smoke alot, and then dont smoke again for multiple hours.Not a great choice for before bed. But if thats all you have, take a nice size rip and give yourself 30mins n a snack, seems to switch into a sleepier high when in a darker enviroment aswell with no light/tv.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sEr1lLSsigAbtuUqOjDw7XiLHMg=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fjZ9suBanRKGAwRQasGRx_wayfarers-green.png"},{"id":1640112,"username":"njRay","text":"Favorite Day time. clear focused, relaxed happy","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/LN9qqi4LLaHMKnh02esy-mIM7HY=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2f81c50UjRtmwRXtUVVQKw_aviator-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3199","title":"New Strain Alert: Remedy, Tangerine Haze, Alice in Wonderland, Rockstar, Venom OG, and Sugar Plum","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1393261200000)\/","text":"We have something for every canna-sseur in this week’s new strains: whether you’re looking for a high-CBD strain to tame your symptoms or an invigorating sativa for this weekend’s festivities, we have recommendations for you.
