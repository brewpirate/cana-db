I had to shy away from pot for a while, dealing with new anxiety issues and everything i experienced made it worse... and was honestly scared to smoke again. i also have chronic joint pain, and i have to say, sunburn opened a new door. zero anxiety, rather a quiet mind and i can still 100% go about my day. amazing. \n",
