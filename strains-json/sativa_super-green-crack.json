In addition to a number of cow-themed strains such as Alpha Cow, Madcow, Purple Cow, and Afghan Cow, our comely cattle companions have also inspired an oft-used phrase used in many a Leafly review: \u201cHoly cow!\u201d\nIn honor of these dearly beloved domesticated ungulates, here are eight cannabis strains that inspired Leafly reviewers to exclaim \u201cHoly cow\u201d that I\u2019ve helpfully paired with a corresponding gif.\n\u00a0\u00a0Durban Poison\n\u201choly cow I\u2019m flying. no such thing as stress or anxiety with this strain.\u201d \u2013 chaosanon\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Blockhead\n\u201cI hit some of this from a bong along with some crazy dank lemon skunk and then vaped some of this blockhead (all with a friend) and holy cow i was flying high as a kite.\u201d \u2013 chroniccannabisconsumsr\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Kandy Kush\n\u201cHoly cow was a privilege to try out this strain.

I had to sit down for a sec and as the high progressed I got more and more energetic and super trippy I dont know how else to describe it but like being in. a 3D movie it was weird and then the world got flat and 2D like it was amazing then as I was coming down I felt like a super hero being ably to switch between reality,2D ,And more real than real 3D movie feeling\u201d \u2013 COMetalHead\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Lemon Haze\n\u201cHoly COW.
