My new favorite sativa. A+\n\nThis strain is so good that smoking it convinced me finally write THIS, my very first review, after years of lurking.\n\nI\u0027m 33, have a wife \u0026 2 year-old daughter, own/operate an online business and also work full-time for a medical startup doing UX, design \u0026 front end engineering.  Needless to say, I have a fairly heavy workload on any given day. \n\nI also take Adderall for my version of ADD.  I\u0027d prefer to call it \"wide focus\", because its more about an EXCESS of attention spread across many things at once than a lack of attention.  \n\nI have found that smoking small amounts of sativa throughout the day counteracts the negative effects of Adderall (loss of appetite, anxiety, high blood pressure).  This strain in particular has consistently left me feeling upbeat and ready to tackle any challenge in front of me.  \n\nBeing a designer, I am constantly looking for strains that invoke creativity and new ideas, and Super Jack has never failed for me. \n\nSuper Jack is my new favorite sativa, dethroning its own father, Jack Herer.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/sPaGuIbcIjKwcF8O7kQXXoAFJ6s=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fkfmswExdS0yqeEmdLkUQ_nerd-green.png"},{"id":1635564,"username":"msbrandie","text":"First time Sativa - will def but again.
