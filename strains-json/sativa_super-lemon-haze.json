            "text": "Ever wanted to grow your favorite strain? Leafly and\u00a0General Hydroponics\u00a0are teaming up on a series of grow guides that will equip you with all the tips and tricks you need to grow different strains successfully.\n\nStrain Overview: The sativa-dominant Super Lemon Haze, bred by Green House Seeds, has won two Cannabis Cups, among other awards. A cross between Lemon Skunk and Super Silver Haze, Super Lemon Haze\u2019s flavor embodies a sweet, tart lemon-zest aroma. Its effects mimic the sugar in the fruit that it tastes like, producing an energized, motivated feeling.\nGrow Techniques: Green House Seeds recommends growing this strain with hydroponics. Let the roots take in lots of oxygen and give the plants plenty of space to promote vigorous growth in the buds.\nFlowering Time: 10 weeks\nYield: Moderate to high\nGrow Difficulty: Moderate\nClimate: Ideally kept between 68-80 degrees Fahrenheit, Super Lemon Haze can handle higher humidity (45-55% RH) while flowering.\nIndoor/Outdoor: Indoors is best, due to Super Lemon Haze\u2019s need for close monitoring and warm temperatures. Also, its long flowering periods make it a difficult strain to finish in the fall if you are in a colder region.\nFeeding: Avoid overfeeding, as this plant, though tall, is not dense and thus vulnerable to nutrient burn. When the plant is budding, however, increase its nutrients before the flush to help it finish.",

Slow onset that starts with a light excitement/euphoria and a defined head high. Very focused and cerebral, giggly, and uplifted. Great for daytime and going out. Defined paranoia in certain situations, as well as heavy munchies. After the peak, a mild and energetic come down that lasts a long time. Great for depression and lethargy though not necessarily for anxiety or stress. 8/10\r\n",
