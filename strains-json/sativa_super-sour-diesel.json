            "text": "Come one, come all, to witness the auspicious reading of August\u2019s Strain Review Hall of Fame! As summer drew to a close, Leafly reviewers were out in full force, regaling us with tales of cold fusion and divine yoga pants and dancing squids in space. Behold the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of August\u2019s strain reviews.\nXJ-13\nDoes your strain inspire full orchestral suites, complete with tiny dancers and exotic scents? If not, you\u2019re missing out.\u00a0\n\nWhen I open the jar to smell this XJ-13 it's almost as if little angels carrying baskets of citrus fruits are swirling past me, while a single pine tree stands center of the jar filled with peppermints, all the while a clan of gnomes lay below harvesting honey from the bee hives atop the pine tree\u2026 You get the picture.\n\nThin-Mint\nAnd to think, some people argue cannabis doesn\u2019t stimulate intellectualism.\n\nTook some of this to relax and ended up in a 30 minute debate with my wife about the political ramifications of sci-fi levels of discoveries, like cold fusion or first contact.\n\nGSC (f.k.a Girl Scout Cookies)\nAnd on the 5th day God created\u2026 Yoga pants?\u00a0\n\nCannabis has many things to be proud of and this strain is it.. pretty sure Leafly was created on it.. god created yoga pants on it, the oceans grew, the gods bathe in it, its little waynes cologne\u2026 well maybe\n\nPurple Kush\nSome people like to consume and enjoy the munchies, other people like to become their munchies.\n\nI feel pretty good at the moment, I feel like tartar sauce and warm water or a stick of butter melting over a steamy hot cob of corn. And a biscuit with butter and peanut butter, and chicken, with olives on the side and a coke please. (:\u00a0\n\nNorthern Lights\nBut does it also make you feel like a cynical anthropomorphic octopus?\u00a0\n\nI feel like Squidward in space\n\nHoly Grail Kush\nEven the Knights who say \"Ni\" would have to agree that a strain which inspires poetry is fine indeed.\n\nYou'll laugh and you'll cry\u00a0\nBut you'll sure not die\u00a0\nBut now I'm in a cloud\u00a0\nBut my rain is dry.\u00a0\nugh he's so annoying.\n\nSuper Sour Diesel\nAre we talking a 5K or an Ironman?\n\nIt's not a dash right off sprinting type of weed but rather a walking-speedy walking-jogging- and then running weed. Super amazing once you get running.\n\nAmnesia Haze\nNot only does this strain deliver a tranquil high, it will nearly deliver you to any place your heart desires!\n\nWhen asked how I felt I said \"I feel like I\u2019m on a pebble of waterfalls\" and visualized a giant smooth white quartz pebble with waterfalls draining off the edge; it felt tranquil.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGreen Crack\nSometimes you just gotta shake yo\u2019 groove thang.\n\nI JUST WANNA DANCE YOU GUISE!!!111!!!\n\n\nWanted to Jam Out and Shake my Ass! #bam\u00a0\n\nphoto credit (cropped): roryrory via photopin cc",

            "text": "I was strain hunting and saw this at a local club, so I decided to pick up an 8th.  Tight dense nuggets covered in a myriad of hazy white crystals.  Beautiful orange hairs sprout from everywhere.  The aroma initially hits you with a gentle sweetness and then your nose is flooded with an electrifying sour lemony overtone, sending a wave of chills up and down your spine.  The smell alone acts as an aphrodisiac.  Upon vaping, more of the sweet flavor is revealed making the taste like a sour lemon drop candy.  Effects weren't felt right away, but seemed to slowly come on.  At the 01:00hr mark this single bowl has become psychedelic.  My thought process is completely altered.  My mind is making bizarre and creative associations, manifesting  highly unusual thoughts which is a state often experienced on traditional psychedelic plants.  Senses are amplified, the world around me feels like I'm in a dream.  Music is godly at high volumes.  Food tastes like it was sent from the heavens.  A wonderful sativa cerebral high that verges on being psychedelic.  This strain has the potential to give you a new perspective on life. It's that powerful.  I don't suffer from any prescribed pain, so my experience with this strain's pain management is unknown.  I do, however, face frequent depression and I found this strain to be very effective.  HIGHLY recommended for creativity, stress, and depression.  This strain is now in regular circulation.  Good vibes!",
