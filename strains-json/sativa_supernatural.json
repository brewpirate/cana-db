Born in Europe in the 1990s, contemporary EDM encompasses a huge collection of sub-genres such as dubstep, riddim, techno, and trance—just to name a few. Its primal emphasis on drums and heavy use of bass make it a physical experience as much as an auditory one. For this reason, some sub-genres have been described as “future metal,” due to a technical styling and heavy sound that inspire high-energy dance and emotional release.\n\nBelow, enjoy five excellent EDM albums with our recommended strains for a stimulating, cerebral, and emotional experience that will move with you from the inside out.\nMass Manipulation by Rezz\n(mau5trap Recordings)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Raspberry Kush\nMass Manipulation begins with a soothing, masculine voice urging you to focus on your breathing and allow hypnosis to loosen your entire body. “Relax,” the voice whispers before the music breaks and dives into dirty, technical dance beats. The result is an album that urges the listener to turn off their mind and feel their body with the upbeat, gritty music that tends to move it. The rest of Mass Manipulation follows a similar trajectory, expertly walking the line between meditative music and EDM. Rezz’s thick, hypnotic, futuristic sound pulls you in like quicksand, gently tugging you along and reminding you not to struggle—just relax.\nReflective Part 1 and Part 2 by Bassnectar\n(Amorphous Music)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Love Potion #1\nBassnectar has been releasing music for fourteen years and has steadily risen to the height of success in the EDM scene. Reflective is his latest, released in 2017. It reflects Bassnectar’s penchant for effortless yet complex and structured music that keeps the listener engaged while immersing her in a futuristic musical journey. The bass-heavy album balances spacey, techy sounds with hard, grimy, bold breaks for a guttural feeling that demands movement (whether it be dance or head thrashing). Reflective won’t disappoint as it builds a world around you and invites you deep, deep inside.\n\nDie Young EP by Kai Wachi\n(Kannibalen Records)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Supernatural\nThe Die Young EP may only have five songs total, but Kai Wachi’s unique, distinctive sound and playful vibe makes it 20 minutes of solid, engaging EDM that will have you scouring his discography for more. Die Young isn’t afraid to explore feelings and sounds spanning whimsical melodies to gritty drops that can be felt deep in your bones. The album makes use of a variety of instruments in addition to its eclectic electronic beats, creating a complexity that will keep listeners guessing in the best way possible.\nOpen the Vault by Ill-Esha\n(666590 Records DK)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Morning Glory\nOpen the Vault stands out with its lighthearted and spirited vibe. Ill-Esha’s distinct style of musical fusion is in full force as she creates a soundscape that delves into floaty, fanciful melodies and metallic, technical beats. The cherry on top is Ill-Esha’s own harmonic voice, as she sings atop certain tracks and reminds listeners of all the ways in which she stands out. Open the Vault’s eclectic rhythms, deep bass, and captivating melodies are like a cool drink of water mixed with mind-altering punch.\n\nThere The Vultures Will Gather by Helicopter Showdown\n(Anemnesis)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Dutch Haze\nThere The Vultures Will Gather begins with a spacey, transcendental medley of music and distant voices before plunging suddenly and mercilessly into heavy, gritty beats. “Helicopter Showdown” manages to blend these two elements simultaneously, casting airy, tinkling melodies on top of filthy, bass-heavy breaks. The result makes There The Vultures Will Gather wild, bold music capable of whisking anyone into an intergalactic dance frenzy.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/02113546/edm-albums-while-high.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/best-electronic-dance-music-to-listen-to-while-high"},{"id":"contentitems-7858","title":"Pair These Cannabis Strains With 5 of Stephen King\u0027s Best Novels","author":"Gage Peake","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1474584346000)\/","text":"From classics like The Green Mile and Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption to supernatural spookers like Carrie and The Shining, Stephen King has gifted the world with magnificent pieces of literature that feature surprising depth. If you’re thinking of picking up one of his works, here are some cannabis strains that pair well with some of our favorite stories from the King of Horror.\nCujo\n\nYou might remember this classic from 1981. Cujo, a sweet good-natured dog in the beginning of the story, gets bit on the nose by a rabid bat and ultimately transforms into a killing machine that tears into neighbors and police sheriffs indiscriminately. Like all of the entries on this list, Cujo was adapted into a movie in 1983.\nStrain Pairing: Snoop’s Dream\n\nPicking a strain to pair with this story proved difficult, but after some consideration, we had to choose one of our favorite dog-themed strains, Snoop Dream. Named after the hip-hop superstar, Snoop’s Dream is a mix of Blue Dream and Master Kush, making for medium-sized dense buds covered in orange hairs. The hybrid’s relaxing qualities would be the perfect mix to calm down a killer dog terrorizing a small town in Maine.\nIT\n\nAnother Stephen King Horror novel, IT, published in 1986, follows the exploits of seven children as they are terrorized by the eponymous being, which exploits the fears and phobias of its victims in order to disguise itself while hunting its prey. Pennywise, the villain in the book, primarily appears in the form of a clown in the story, making this a truly riveting tale that was the best-selling book in the United States the year it came out.\nStrain Pairing: Pennywise\n\nPairing this story with a cannabis strain was easy — we recommend Pennywise, which got its name from King’s book. Pennywise is a high-CBD indica cross between Harlequin and Jack the Ripper, a combination that lends this strain its killer clown name. The high CBD would help with any pain brought on by a psychopathic killer clown.\nRita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption (from Different Seasons)\n\nMy personal favorite Stephen King story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, appears in his anthology Different Seasons, published in 1982. It was adapted for the big screen in 1994 as The Shawshank Redemption, one of the most critically acclaimed movies of all time. The story follows a man named Andy Dufrense, a banker from Maine, who was convicted for the double murder of his wife and her lover. The only problem? He didn’t commit the crimes. Dufresne spends nearly 30 years in prison before escaping through a tunnel he’d spent two decades digging with a rock hammer.\nStrain Pairing: Star Killer\n\nStar Killer is a solid pairing with Shawshank, as the dense, purple buds offer a sweet, lemon flavor and aid in treating pain, insomnia, and PTSD, among other things. It’s a good option for a person who just dug his way out of prison after spending nearly three decades there locked up.\nThe Shining\n\nPublished in 1977, Stephen King’s The Shining is still captivating audiences all around the world. The book was King’s first hardback bestseller, establishing himas a preeminent author in the horror genre. The Shining centers on the life of Jack Torrance, an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, who takes over the historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies. His family joins him, including his young son Danny, who possesses “the shining,” an array of psychic abilities that allow him to see the hotel’s horrific past. While the family is holed up in the hotel for the winter, supernatural forces emerge and put the whole family in grave danger.\nStrain Pairing: Jack Herer\nWe paired this story with Jack Herer, a sativa-dominant cannabis strain, as a nod to one of the famous lines from Stanley Kubrick’s film adaption of the novel, “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” With this strain, there will be no dullness in your life, that’s for sure.\nThe Green Mile\n\nLast but certainly not least is the serial novel The Green Mile. Another one of my personal favorites, the story is about a death row supervisor’s encounter with John Coffey, an unusual inmate who displays inexplicable healing and empathetic abilities. Written in 1996, the book takes place in Louisiana in the early 1930s.\nStrain Pairing: Supernatural\nWe paired it with the cannabis strain Supernatural, something that is very relatable to Mr. Coffey. The strain is a sativa-dominant blend that is a great indoor option, with a biting, skunky zest and uplifting sativa effects that will surely bring you supernatural powers.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/22140726/stephen-king.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/pair-cannabis-strains-5-stephen-kings-best-novels"}],"reviewCount":19,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":5.6818181818181817},{"name":"Flowery","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Earthy","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Diesel","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":3.4090909090909087}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":28.030303030303028},{"name":"Energetic","score":25.757575757575758},{"name":"Focused","score":24.621212121212118},{"name":"Aroused","score":20.075757575757574},{"name":"Euphoric","score":13.636363636363635}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Depression","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Fatigue","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Pain","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Cramps","score":2.2727272727272729}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Anxiety","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"PTSD","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.1363636363636365}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.1363636363636365},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":1.1363636363636365}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_596b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/508860/b/supernatural__primary_17a9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_6a6b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/505098/b/supernatural__primary_b1d9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_babc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494666/b/supernatural__primary_bcb2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_c8a8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/413079/b/supernatural__primary_9c41.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":4,"popularCities":["Cook, WA","Seattle, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/supernatural","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.36842105263158/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Grape Ape","subtitle":null,"slug":"grape-ape","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/grape-ape","symbol":"Ga","applink":"leafly://strain/grape-ape"},{"name":"The Flav","subtitle":null,"slug":"the-flav","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/the-flav","symbol":"Tfl","applink":"leafly://strain/the-flav"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":53,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":null,"environment":"Indoor","growNotes":"\n\t50-56 days flower\n\tPrefers indoor\n\n"}}

The strain is a sativa-dominant blend that is a great indoor option, with a biting, skunky zest and uplifting sativa effects that will surely bring you supernatural powers.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/22140726/stephen-king.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/pair-cannabis-strains-5-stephen-kings-best-novels"}],"reviewCount":19,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":5.6818181818181817},{"name":"Flowery","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Earthy","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Diesel","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":3.4090909090909087}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":28.030303030303028},{"name":"Energetic","score":25.757575757575758},{"name":"Focused","score":24.621212121212118},{"name":"Aroused","score":20.075757575757574},{"name":"Euphoric","score":13.636363636363635}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Depression","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Fatigue","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Pain","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Cramps","score":2.2727272727272729}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Anxiety","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"PTSD","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.1363636363636365}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.1363636363636365},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":1.1363636363636365}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_596b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/508860/b/supernatural__primary_17a9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_6a6b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/505098/b/supernatural__primary_b1d9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_babc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494666/b/supernatural__primary_bcb2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_c8a8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/413079/b/supernatural__primary_9c41.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":4,"popularCities":["Cook, WA","Seattle, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/supernatural","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.36842105263158/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Grape Ape","subtitle":null,"slug":"grape-ape","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/grape-ape","symbol":"Ga","applink":"leafly://strain/grape-ape"},{"name":"The Flav","subtitle":null,"slug":"the-flav","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/the-flav","symbol":"Tfl","applink":"leafly://strain/the-flav"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":53,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":null,"environment":"Indoor","growNotes":"\n\t50-56 days flower\n\tPrefers indoor\n\n"}}

Born in Europe in the 1990s, contemporary EDM encompasses a huge collection of sub-genres such as dubstep, riddim, techno, and trance—just to name a few. Its primal emphasis on drums and heavy use of bass make it a physical experience as much as an auditory one. For this reason, some sub-genres have been described as “future metal,” due to a technical styling and heavy sound that inspire high-energy dance and emotional release.\n\nBelow, enjoy five excellent EDM albums with our recommended strains for a stimulating, cerebral, and emotional experience that will move with you from the inside out.\nMass Manipulation by Rezz\n(mau5trap Recordings)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Raspberry Kush\nMass Manipulation begins with a soothing, masculine voice urging you to focus on your breathing and allow hypnosis to loosen your entire body. “Relax,” the voice whispers before the music breaks and dives into dirty, technical dance beats. The result is an album that urges the listener to turn off their mind and feel their body with the upbeat, gritty music that tends to move it. The rest of Mass Manipulation follows a similar trajectory, expertly walking the line between meditative music and EDM. Rezz’s thick, hypnotic, futuristic sound pulls you in like quicksand, gently tugging you along and reminding you not to struggle—just relax.\nReflective Part 1 and Part 2 by Bassnectar\n(Amorphous Music)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Love Potion #1\nBassnectar has been releasing music for fourteen years and has steadily risen to the height of success in the EDM scene. Reflective is his latest, released in 2017. It reflects Bassnectar’s penchant for effortless yet complex and structured music that keeps the listener engaged while immersing her in a futuristic musical journey. The bass-heavy album balances spacey, techy sounds with hard, grimy, bold breaks for a guttural feeling that demands movement (whether it be dance or head thrashing). Reflective won’t disappoint as it builds a world around you and invites you deep, deep inside.\n\nDie Young EP by Kai Wachi\n(Kannibalen Records)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Supernatural\nThe Die Young EP may only have five songs total, but Kai Wachi’s unique, distinctive sound and playful vibe makes it 20 minutes of solid, engaging EDM that will have you scouring his discography for more. Die Young isn’t afraid to explore feelings and sounds spanning whimsical melodies to gritty drops that can be felt deep in your bones. The album makes use of a variety of instruments in addition to its eclectic electronic beats, creating a complexity that will keep listeners guessing in the best way possible.\nOpen the Vault by Ill-Esha\n(666590 Records DK)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Morning Glory\nOpen the Vault stands out with its lighthearted and spirited vibe. Ill-Esha’s distinct style of musical fusion is in full force as she creates a soundscape that delves into floaty, fanciful melodies and metallic, technical beats. The cherry on top is Ill-Esha’s own harmonic voice, as she sings atop certain tracks and reminds listeners of all the ways in which she stands out. Open the Vault’s eclectic rhythms, deep bass, and captivating melodies are like a cool drink of water mixed with mind-altering punch.\n\nThere The Vultures Will Gather by Helicopter Showdown\n(Anemnesis)\nStrain Pairing Recommendation: Dutch Haze\nThere The Vultures Will Gather begins with a spacey, transcendental medley of music and distant voices before plunging suddenly and mercilessly into heavy, gritty beats. “Helicopter Showdown” manages to blend these two elements simultaneously, casting airy, tinkling melodies on top of filthy, bass-heavy breaks. The result makes There The Vultures Will Gather wild, bold music capable of whisking anyone into an intergalactic dance frenzy.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/02113546/edm-albums-while-high.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/best-electronic-dance-music-to-listen-to-while-high"},{"id":"contentitems-7858","title":"Pair These Cannabis Strains With 5 of Stephen King\u0027s Best Novels","author":"Gage Peake","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1474584346000)\/","text":"From classics like The Green Mile and Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption to supernatural spookers like Carrie and The Shining, Stephen King has gifted the world with magnificent pieces of literature that feature surprising depth. If you’re thinking of picking up one of his works, here are some cannabis strains that pair well with some of our favorite stories from the King of Horror.\nCujo\n\nYou might remember this classic from 1981. Cujo, a sweet good-natured dog in the beginning of the story, gets bit on the nose by a rabid bat and ultimately transforms into a killing machine that tears into neighbors and police sheriffs indiscriminately. Like all of the entries on this list, Cujo was adapted into a movie in 1983.\nStrain Pairing: Snoop’s Dream\n\nPicking a strain to pair with this story proved difficult, but after some consideration, we had to choose one of our favorite dog-themed strains, Snoop Dream. Named after the hip-hop superstar, Snoop’s Dream is a mix of Blue Dream and Master Kush, making for medium-sized dense buds covered in orange hairs. The hybrid’s relaxing qualities would be the perfect mix to calm down a killer dog terrorizing a small town in Maine.\nIT\n\nAnother Stephen King Horror novel, IT, published in 1986, follows the exploits of seven children as they are terrorized by the eponymous being, which exploits the fears and phobias of its victims in order to disguise itself while hunting its prey. Pennywise, the villain in the book, primarily appears in the form of a clown in the story, making this a truly riveting tale that was the best-selling book in the United States the year it came out.\nStrain Pairing: Pennywise\n\nPairing this story with a cannabis strain was easy — we recommend Pennywise, which got its name from King’s book. Pennywise is a high-CBD indica cross between Harlequin and Jack the Ripper, a combination that lends this strain its killer clown name. The high CBD would help with any pain brought on by a psychopathic killer clown.\nRita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption (from Different Seasons)\n\nMy personal favorite Stephen King story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, appears in his anthology Different Seasons, published in 1982. It was adapted for the big screen in 1994 as The Shawshank Redemption, one of the most critically acclaimed movies of all time. The story follows a man named Andy Dufrense, a banker from Maine, who was convicted for the double murder of his wife and her lover. The only problem? He didn’t commit the crimes. Dufresne spends nearly 30 years in prison before escaping through a tunnel he’d spent two decades digging with a rock hammer.\nStrain Pairing: Star Killer\n\nStar Killer is a solid pairing with Shawshank, as the dense, purple buds offer a sweet, lemon flavor and aid in treating pain, insomnia, and PTSD, among other things. It’s a good option for a person who just dug his way out of prison after spending nearly three decades there locked up.\nThe Shining\n\nPublished in 1977, Stephen King’s The Shining is still captivating audiences all around the world. The book was King’s first hardback bestseller, establishing himas a preeminent author in the horror genre. The Shining centers on the life of Jack Torrance, an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, who takes over the historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies. His family joins him, including his young son Danny, who possesses “the shining,” an array of psychic abilities that allow him to see the hotel’s horrific past. While the family is holed up in the hotel for the winter, supernatural forces emerge and put the whole family in grave danger.\nStrain Pairing: Jack Herer\nWe paired this story with Jack Herer, a sativa-dominant cannabis strain, as a nod to one of the famous lines from Stanley Kubrick’s film adaption of the novel, “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” With this strain, there will be no dullness in your life, that’s for sure.\nThe Green Mile\n\nLast but certainly not least is the serial novel The Green Mile. Another one of my personal favorites, the story is about a death row supervisor’s encounter with John Coffey, an unusual inmate who displays inexplicable healing and empathetic abilities. Written in 1996, the book takes place in Louisiana in the early 1930s.\nStrain Pairing: Supernatural\nWe paired it with the cannabis strain Supernatural, something that is very relatable to Mr. Coffey. The strain is a sativa-dominant blend that is a great indoor option, with a biting, skunky zest and uplifting sativa effects that will surely bring you supernatural powers.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/22140726/stephen-king.jpg","urlslug":"/news/strains-products/pair-cannabis-strains-5-stephen-kings-best-novels"}],"reviewCount":19,"flavors":[{"name":"Citrus","score":5.6818181818181817},{"name":"Flowery","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Earthy","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Diesel","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Spicy/Herbal","score":3.4090909090909087}],"effects":[{"name":"Relaxed","score":28.030303030303028},{"name":"Energetic","score":25.757575757575758},{"name":"Focused","score":24.621212121212118},{"name":"Aroused","score":20.075757575757574},{"name":"Euphoric","score":13.636363636363635}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Depression","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Fatigue","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Pain","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Cramps","score":2.2727272727272729}],"conditions":[{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"Anxiety","score":4.5454545454545459},{"name":"PTSD","score":3.4090909090909087},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":2.2727272727272729},{"name":"Arthritis","score":1.1363636363636365}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":1.1363636363636365},{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":1.1363636363636365}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":2,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_596b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/508860/b/supernatural__primary_17a9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_6a6b.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/505098/b/supernatural__primary_b1d9.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_babc.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/494666/b/supernatural__primary_bcb2.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/supernatural_100x100_c8a8.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/413079/b/supernatural__primary_9c41.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":4,"popularCities":["Cook, WA","Seattle, WA"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/supernatural","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.36842105263158/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Grape Ape","subtitle":null,"slug":"grape-ape","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/grape-ape","symbol":"Ga","applink":"leafly://strain/grape-ape"},{"name":"The Flav","subtitle":null,"slug":"the-flav","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/the-flav","symbol":"Tfl","applink":"leafly://strain/the-flav"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":53,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Tall","averageYield":null,"environment":"Indoor","growNotes":"\n\t50-56 days flower\n\tPrefers indoor\n\n"}}
