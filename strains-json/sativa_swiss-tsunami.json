Very similar to the AC/DC strain, but with better flavor in my opinion. I use high CBD strains in combination with my RSO edibles to combat my severe back and body pains, as well as my PTSD. I\u0027ve been in less pain, and had less episodes using this combo. It\u0027s really turned my life around.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/iR6IuKvNS4kfUN8_zPVWuv2RQhI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fzZcIzCLFRUK1wTKghrMN_aviator-red.png"},{"id":1621959,"username":"Jenspark","text":"This is everything I have been looking for in a strain. I wanted to be able to come home from work, veg on the couch and let the worries of the day melt away, without conking out. I vaped Swiss Tsunami from a Select cartridge. One 3-second hit and I was set for the night. (I have a very low THC tolerance, and am very sensitive to CBD, as well.) I had been panicking over work stuff, and within a few minutes I was more relaxed than I have been in ages, and I was just happy and giggly. At one point, I was laying my face on my cold granite kitchen counter just because it felt good, lol. I did eventually fall asleep about 3 hours later, and I slept for 7 hours, which is unheard of for me. I\u0027m lucky if I get 5 hours. I feel like a new woman!
