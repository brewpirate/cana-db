For Me, it helps to relive chronic  pain.Very much a cerebral happy feeling, yet allows the relaxation of the body. I find this is a good medicine for day or night.  For me, it helps to control the desire to over eat like some of the Indica's will do.. Highly recommend for daytime. Seems to work well for Anxiety and PTSD!",
