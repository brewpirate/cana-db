Literally one of the best tasting strains I've had, and considering this is coming from my favorite Dispensary and breeders, this will be in my regular rotation. Like a slight kick in the teeth of adrenaline with a relaxing haze that puts a smile on your face, this strain was great for helping me stay awake and focus and for tons of euphoria!!! Thank you house of dankness for another amazing creation!!",

            "text": "Small cone like light green nugs littered with orange hairs and a shimmering crystallization. The smell is a mix of skunk and orange. The taste is what really blows my mind! Upon inhale the only taste I can really describe it as is big league bubblegum and brach\u2019s gummy orange slices! With some ganja goodness mixed in of course, but the super candy like sweet orange taste is what really made this bowl over the top as far as enjoyable. Effects were very euphoric, leaving the user to either be relaxed in front of the tv or get up and be productive. If you get a chance to try this strain, I do hope you get the same flavor profile that I did!",
