But with parents like train wreck \u0026 Oregon diesel (I think) it\u0027s no surprise this combo packs an energetic punch. Perfect for starting your day or for starting a project. I never have energy, my health isn\u0027t doing so well. Thank god for sativas. \nThis strain helps big time with opiate withdrawal. I couldn\u0027t make it to the pharmacy to pick up my pills for 2 days, so I tried an indica I had at home but no relief. After tardis I was able to make it thru those 2 days just fine! I even reduced my mg by half!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/kJc1LyLawlfeJ9xGeaJMdVhCp9U=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fmstpXGgRuu3rPFHmtQHb_aviator-green.png"},{"id":1605846,"username":"happyjayx","text":"Wow, what an interesting strain. Rolled it up in joint form. It smelled very earthy, mild and you can smell that Diesel root stem pretty heavily. I did not find the smell too strong however. \n\n\nTaste was a bit earthy with a great sweet/nutty aftertaste. The aftertaste tasted a bit like sweet roasted almonds to me. \n\n\nThe best part of this strain is how smooth it is. I am kind of a wuss when it comes to smoke inhalation and it really hurts when a strain is too rough. However, this is one of the silkiest, creamiest hits I have ever had. It actually cleared up my allergies/sinuses some. It just feels good on your lungs. Good starter bud if giving some to non smoking friends.\n\nThe effects of the strain are exactly as advertised on this website. I felt pumped up, social and talkative. This one gives MORE ability to talk. Anyone who has done Adderall will understand what I mean. I found myself speaking in clear complete sentences, and happily chatting away. I felt the need to go out and go somewhere, to a bar, dance club, or strip club. \n\nThe only downsides to this bud is that smoking too much can make you paranoid, twitchy, and uncomfortably wired. It doesn\u0027t do much for pain, and even less for \"Cerebel Effects\". I noticed no sensitivity to color, visual sensations or deep introspective creative thinking. Purely a social \"good old boy\u0027s\" kind of bud. \n\nI would not recommend this for someone sitting home alone, as a bed time aid, homework aid or someone who needs it for pain. You will want to distract yourself with socializing. GREAT bud for a Day/Night out on the town, Multiplayer video gaming or just hanging around with friends.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":6,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":51.111111111111114},{"name":"Earthy","score":51.111111111111114},{"name":"Diesel","score":25.555555555555557},{"name":"Nutty","score":20},{"name":"Chestnut","score":20}],"effects":[{"name":"Energetic","score":102.22222222222223},{"name":"Talkative","score":93.333333333333329},{"name":"Creative","score":82.222222222222229},{"name":"Happy","score":76.666666666666657},{"name":"Uplifted","score":51.111111111111114}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Depression","score":62.222222222222221},{"name":"Fatigue","score":45.555555555555557},{"name":"Lack of Appetite","score":45.555555555555557},{"name":"Headaches","score":40},{"name":"Stress","score":36.666666666666664}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":71.111111111111114},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":60},{"name":"Alzheimer\u0027s","score":20},{"name":"Anorexia","score":5.5555555555555554},{"name":"Migraines","score":5.5555555555555554}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":51.111111111111114},{"name":"Paranoid","score":25.555555555555557},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":5.5555555555555554},{"name":"Anxious","score":5.5555555555555554}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/tardis_100x100_6e09.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/708655/b/tardis__primary_e346.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/tardis_100x100_0aff.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/680498/b/tardis__primary_1b1e.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":2,"popularCities":["Medford, OR","Portland, OR","Beaverton, OR","Bend, OR","Eugene, OR","McMinnville, OR","Mesa, AZ","Phoenix, AZ","Plymouth, MA","Salem, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/tardis","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Trainwreck","subtitle":null,"slug":"trainwreck","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck","symbol":"Tw","applink":"leafly://strain/trainwreck"},{"name":"Oregon Diesel","subtitle":null,"slug":"oregon-diesel","category":"Indica","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/indica/oregon-diesel","symbol":"Odi","applink":"leafly://strain/oregon-diesel"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":0,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
