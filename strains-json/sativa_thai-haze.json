            "text": "Another historic month for cannabis is behind us: Washington state opened their recreational cannabis stores,\u00a0D.C. decriminalized marijuana, Florida approved a medical marijuana program, the House of Representatives introduced the Charlotte's Web Medical Hemp Act of 2014,\u00a0and the\u00a0New York Times called for an end to prohibition \u2014 and published their first ever cannabis advertisement (did you see, did you see?!).\nKeep spreading the knowledge, good people of Leafly. It\u2019s killing prohibition, and this week we have three new cannabis studies to help you fight the good fight. Yeah education! YEAH SCIENCE! #JustSayKnow\n1. This Cannabis Terpene Reduces Anxiety and Depression\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of cannabinoids like THC and CBD, but there are many other therapeutic compounds in cannabis you may not be aware of. Allow us to introduce you to terpenes, the aromatic oils secreted by cannabis that provide rich flavor profiles and a variety of medical benefits. According to a recent study, one cannabis terpene called Beta-caryophyllene (which is also found in spices like pepper) has been found to reduce anxiety and depression by activating CB-2 receptors.\u00a0\nStrains like the unfortunately-named\u00a0Cat Piss, Power Plant, and Thai Haze have been rated very effective for treatment of anxiety and depression. Could it be a coincidence that Leafly reviewers happened to tag these strains with a pepper flavor, or could Beta-caryophyllene actually be at work here?\n2. Endocannabinoids Protect Brain Cells After Injury\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, endocannabinoids are natural compounds our body produces. They\u2019re similar to the chemicals found in cannabis, so researchers suspect that deficiencies in the endocannabinoid system could be treated with compounds found in the cannabis plant.\u00a0\nOn this point, a new study has found that higher levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide correlate with improved functioning in mice with traumatic brain injury. By inhibiting the enzyme FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase), researchers noticed an increase in anandamide and thus improved motor function and working memory, while reducing anxiety and neurodegeneration.\n3. Cannabinoids May Help HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders\n\nHIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) is a condition in which HIV enters the nervous system and affects nerve cell activity, resulting in impaired memory, attention, language, and other cognitive processes. Activation of the CB-2 system by way of cannabinoids, however, may slow the progression of these symptoms according to a study published in Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology. Researchers found that CB-2 activation was associated with reduced neuroinflammation, inhibited HIV replication, and suppressed activity of neurotoxic proteins. Given the fact that certain cannabinoids bind to these CB-2 receptor sites, it\u2019s possible that cannabis compounds hold promise in treatment of HIV and related conditions.\nImage credits: Emily Carr's Sunlight in the Forest,\u00a0Seascape, Reforestation Cedar Sanctuary, Beach and Sky",

Like many sativas, this strain takes longer to flower and may require some experience to grow since it can be fickle. Space can also be a concern as plants grow large and tall (up to six feet). Its yellow-green flowers should be sticky and will give off a spicy and skunky scent that Haze lovers will recognize. The taste also includes an earthy sweetness that is telling of its Thai genetics. Effects can be slow to come on, but be careful: once they do, the almost psychedelic effects of &ldquo;haze brain&rdquo; are definitely possible side effects.</p>\n",

I do like the strain as it made me focused and energetic.  Also caused me to be extremely horny, more than any other strain I've smoked.  I did pick up some kosher kush after a few days of smoking this strain I needed to balance out. I also suffer from anxiety and chronic pain so Indicas help me as well.  Awesome sativa strain for you sativa junkies out there. My girlfriend loves it for many obvious reasons. lol",
