            "text": "DEAM. Smoking this now one my patio. I usually don't like the skunky taste but this is SMOOTH. White ash on thisJ I rolled. I also rolled it with fresh high quality pipe tobacco, so it's gong down nicely. I'm about 5 minutes into this spliff and I'm already feelin loose. I feel like a stack of flapjacks, with melted butter rolling down my back. LOL. Btw, I need to find me some Pineapple Express.\n\nOkay, 10 mins into it: If all of humanity smoked this strain, I feel like we would live in a much more positive world. Fuck this Trump guy who became president... he needs to get his King Tut on. \n\n15 minutes: I'm noticing everything now. I need to water these dry ass plants on my patio. I'm realizing now that I don't think I'm responsible enough to grown a nice weed plant, myself. It would really save me some cash. Either way, I'm fine paying the extra price for this strain... because it's BOMB as fuuuaaaack.\n\n20 minutes: Spliffy is just about finished... gonna take a shower and fix up some late brunch. \n\nHappy Veteran's Day, respect to all who serve, and more respect to all that have lost their life to get to this state of freedom our country is in. With that said, be the best person you can be... and don't let our veterans down.\n\nProps to Garden Of Eden in Hayward, California for selling this strain... and MAJOR PROPS to the anonymous (and unlisted) Farm for growing this thing of beauty. 5-Stars!",
