Smoking this now one my patio. I usually don\u0027t like the skunky taste but this is SMOOTH. White ash on thisJ I rolled. I also rolled it with fresh high quality pipe tobacco, so it\u0027s gong down nicely. I\u0027m about 5 minutes into this spliff and I\u0027m already feelin loose. I feel like a stack of flapjacks, with melted butter rolling down my back. LOL. Btw, I need to find me some Pineapple Express.\n\nOkay, 10 mins into it: If all of humanity smoked this strain, I feel like we would live in a much more positive world. Fuck this Trump guy who became president... he needs to get his King Tut on. \n\n15 minutes: I\u0027m noticing everything now. I need to water these dry ass plants on my patio. I\u0027m realizing now that I don\u0027t think I\u0027m responsible enough to grown a nice weed plant, myself. It would really save me some cash. Either way, I\u0027m fine paying the extra price for this strain... because it\u0027s BOMB as fuuuaaaack.\n\n20 minutes: Spliffy is just about finished... gonna take a shower and fix up some late brunch. \n\nHappy Veteran\u0027s Day, respect to all who serve, and more respect to all that have lost their life to get to this state of freedom our country is in. With that said, be the best person you can be... and don\u0027t let our veterans down.\n\nProps to Garden Of Eden in Hayward, California for selling this strain... and MAJOR PROPS to the anonymous (and unlisted) Farm for growing this thing of beauty. 5-Stars!","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/XRYqzYK3o4q7eiqa4tRKs0rwo7Q=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fW7fVX5AQLmXra7zAGlYf_wayfarers-red.png"},{"id":1643067,"username":"Backyardfishfight","text":"When starting the grow for the first time, I went big and chose this strain. now 5 years in, growing several different ladies, this girl still never stops amazing me.. it is a bit tough for beginners, mold, humidity, etc..but well worth the learning experience.. my all-time favorite","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/EsB9lXCri57tN17h49dVOnCDkFI=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fTBeeQQk0TGeLYj4SjC6Z_old-school-red.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[{"id":"contentitems-3383","title":"New Strains Alert: Rare Darkness, Tutankhamon, Quantum Kush, Gemstone, and Tutti Frutti","author":"Bailey Rahn","category":null,"date":"\/Date(1415383200000)\/","text":"This week\u0027s new strains are in!
