Good for going out and doing stuff. Tread carefully though, I found I was very easily distracted. \r\nIt did a lot for pain, Within in minutes Arthritis pain in my hands was decreased drastically and my appetite sky rocketed, almost to much, but still great. (not munches, full on appetite).\r\nAS for negatives, dizziness certainly happened for me but it was less of an uncomfortable dizzy and more of an uplifting kind. Luckily to, there was almost no burn out.",
