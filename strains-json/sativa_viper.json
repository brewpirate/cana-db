I've heard people say viper will burn you out but honestly I believe the high is meant to start of soaring and energetic. If you can handle sativas this one is great for treating symptoms of anxiety and depression. I really wish there were more of these amazing landrace crosses available at large. One of my fave sativas for an upbeat, long lasting cerebral buzz",
