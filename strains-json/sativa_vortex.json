In lieu of extensive preparation, the best punches are simply made by layering complementary flavors, and terpene-laden cannabis adds one more element of both flavor and effect, augmenting the overall experience of classic fall punch drinks.\nThe following autumnal drink recipes are adapted to accommodate the addition of cannabis tinctures. While any infused tincture you have on hand will do, we’ve recommended a few specific strains whose terpenes amplify each elixir. If you don’t have any tinctures handy, you can make your own, or check the menus of your favorite local dispensaries to find a place where you can pick one up.\n\nMix up a batch of one of the following, pop the pitcher in your fridge, and enjoy an extra-chill punch at your leisure. Cheers to fall!\nSparkling Sativa-Pear Punch\n\nThis pretty pink punch is ideal for the last few semi-sunny fall afternoons on the patio or porch. Whether you’re expecting company or cozied up on your own, keep plenty on hand so you’re ready whenever autumn calls for something to sip.\n\n2 parts pear nectar or pear juice\n2 parts Prosecco (make this a non-alcoholic punch with sparkling cider or lemon-lime soda)\n1 part cranberry juice\n10 mg-worth of cannabis tincture (suggested strains: sweet Candy Jack, tart Vortex, or floral Alice in Wonderland)\nGarnish: pear slice and/or freshly grated nutmeg\n\nAdapted from Sparking Pear-Prosecco Punch by Delish.\nCanna-Pome-Grapefruit Punch\n\nThis fruity pomegranate-grapefruit concoction marries your cannabis tincture with bright citrus notes and deep dark pomegranate colors and characteristics. It’s bold, beautiful, and guaranteed to put a smile on your face.\n\n2 parts pomegranate juice\n1 part grapefruit vodka (try Deep Eddy, Smirnoff, or Absolut – or omit the alcohol by subbing in soda water)\n1 part fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice\n10 mg-worth of cannabis tincture (suggested strains: fruit-punchy Dream Berry, grapefruit-orangey Citrix, or the descriptively-named Grapefruit)\nGarnish: pomegranate seeds or a grapefruit wheel\n\nAdapted from Pomegranate Grapefruit Punch by A Simple Pantry.\nAutumn Apple Indica Punch\n\nThis non-alcoholic apple punch is bona-fide fall in a glass: at once crisp, cool, juicy, and refreshing, it’s ratcheted up a notch by the addition of an indica-infused tincture. What better way to melt seasonal stress away?\n\n3 parts apple cider\n2 parts cranberry juice\n1 part ginger beer\n10 mg-worth of cannabis tincture (suggested strains: apple-vanilla Butter OG, honeyed Cream Caramel, or rich, sweet Love Potion #9)\nSqueeze of fresh lime juice\nGarnish: fresh cranberries and a cinnamon stick\n\nAdapted from Apple Orchard Punch by Allrecipes.\nNote: Always imbibe both cannabis and alcohol responsibly, and never drive after consuming either. When in doubt on the potency of your tincture, start with a small amount and work up – you can always add more, but you can’t add less.","thumbnail":"https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20132059/fruit-punch-header.jpg","urlslug":"/news/lifestyle/recipes-for-cannabis-fall-fruit-punch-drinks"}],"reviewCount":222,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":24.137134052388291},{"name":"Tropical","score":23.120184899845917},{"name":"Citrus","score":14.137134052388291},{"name":"Mint","score":12.61171032357473},{"name":"Woody","score":11.101694915254237}],"effects":[{"name":"Uplifted","score":79.599383667180277},{"name":"Energetic","score":76.224961479198768},{"name":"Happy","score":70.362095531587059},{"name":"Focused","score":60.1386748844376},{"name":"Euphoric","score":50.955315870570111}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Stress","score":59.237288135593218},{"name":"Depression","score":36.186440677966104},{"name":"Pain","score":25.423728813559322},{"name":"Muscle Spasms","score":11.016949152542374},{"name":"Cramps","score":10.59322033898305}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":49.137134052388291},{"name":"Bipolar Disorder","score":21.101694915254239},{"name":"ADD/ADHD","score":12.033898305084746},{"name":"PTSD","score":11.949152542372882},{"name":"Asthma","score":10.254237288135593}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":51.579352850539294},{"name":"Headache","score":23.713405238828969},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":15.338983050847457},{"name":"Anxious","score":12.696456086286595},{"name":"Dizzy","score":11.949152542372882}],"articlesAvailable":true,"articleTotalCount":1,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/vortex_100x100_915c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/675114/b/vortex__primary_42a3.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/vortex_100x100_aaa1.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/638603/b/vortex__primary_ed2a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/vortex_100x100_3ef4.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/608235/b/vortex__primary_6470.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/vortex_100x100_e222.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/594732/b/vortex__primary_bf9b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/vortex_100x100_7119.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/593578/b/vortex__primary_4039.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/vortex_100x100_09e9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/572275/b/vortex__primary_752a.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":63,"popularCities":["Portland, OR","Seattle, WA","Spokane, WA","Eugene, OR","Vancouver, WA","Everett, WA","Shoreline, WA","Airway Heights, WA","Bothell, WA","McMinnville, OR"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/vortex","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.2972972972973/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Apollo 13","subtitle":null,"slug":"apollo-13","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/apollo-13","symbol":"A13","applink":"leafly://strain/apollo-13"},{"name":"Space Queen","subtitle":null,"slug":"space-queen","category":"Hybrid","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen","symbol":"Sq","applink":"leafly://strain/space-queen"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":56,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":"Medium","averageYield":"Medium","environment":"Indoor","growNotes":"\n\tExpresses a good deal of variation in its phenotypes\n\tTGA recommends securing plants with stakes and strings\n\n"}}
