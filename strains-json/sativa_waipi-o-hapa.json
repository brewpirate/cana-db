He threw in a pack of papers and some matches, and we shared a J.  It was creeper, and when he was gone we were so high it was hard to believe.  We walked down to the beach, and halfway there I saw a man walking. I called out to him, and then I didn\u0027t know if I really said anything or I just thought I had, and I got a little wiggy because he had to know we were blasted if I can\u0027t even talk, but then we were there at the beach and the waves went whoosh....whoosh.... on the black, black sand. And it was wondrously clear that the whole of creation was one beautiful expression of the divine.\r\n\r\nWoo.  If it was this strain that guy was growing you gotta get you some.  Aloha. :-)\r\n","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/lJ2VY3JcKjYut_50Yn5tnVlftCU=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fGkYePhpuTiO6OltZh89O_wide-brim-purple.png"},{"id":1552233,"username":"Steviewonderbug","text":"So I know a guy that legaly grows cannabis is Mass. So as he is showing me all his bud, He shows me this Hawaiian strain. It wasn\u0027t even in a jar yet or trimmed. he picked about an 8 th of it right out of the black zip up tarp that he keeps his cannabis to dry. It just happened to dry completely that day.\nSo I went home and trimmed it up. I took a medium sized nug, grinded it, rolled a joint and sparked it up with my girlfriend. Within 5 minutes, I was on another planet. My mouth has a sweet taste of pineapple. I looked at myself in my mirror for 15 minutes just staring at my beat red eyes. After that I did a lot of chores and ate too much food. I then went to bed and had some awesome dream. I have never woken up so happy in my life. The only con I have is I felt paranoid for a good 2 minutes because I didn\u0027t know it was posible to be this high.","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/5/240","avatar":"https://ddd33q3967xhi.cloudfront.net/zpAejlDOaSOf3oYP9foiJu8Grk4=/fit-in/300x300/https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fleafly%2fbin%2fwRzDidxTTBOUgBueztBj_goggles-purple.png"}],"relatedStrains":[],"articles":[],"reviewCount":10,"flavors":[{"name":"Sweet","score":19.444444444444443},{"name":"Tropical","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Honey","score":16.666666666666664},{"name":"Lime","score":5.5555555555555554},{"name":"Mint","score":2.7777777777777777}],"effects":[{"name":"Energetic","score":61.111111111111114},{"name":"Focused","score":55.555555555555557},{"name":"Uplifted","score":44.444444444444443},{"name":"Relaxed","score":38.888888888888886},{"name":"Creative","score":24.999999999999996}],"symptoms":[{"name":"Pain","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Stress","score":8.3333333333333321},{"name":"Depression","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"Fatigue","score":2.7777777777777777}],"conditions":[{"name":"Anxiety","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"Arthritis","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"Spinal Cord Injury","score":2.7777777777777777}],"negatives":[{"name":"Dry Mouth","score":5.5555555555555554},{"name":"Dry Eyes","score":2.7777777777777777},{"name":"Paranoid","score":2.7777777777777777}],"articlesAvailable":false,"articleTotalCount":0,"photos":[{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/waipi-o-hapa_100x100_1fee.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/213295/b/waipi-o-hapa__primary_ef25.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/waipi-o-hapa_100x100_b854.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/213231/b/waipi-o-hapa__primary_ec76.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/waipi-o-hapa_100x100_e37c.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/212194/b/waipi-o-hapa__primary_f50a.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/waipi-o-hapa_100x100_95a9.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/71883/b/waipi-o-hapa_825x550_bc1b.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/waipi-o-hapa_100x100_e733.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/23017/b/waipi-o-hapa_825x550_3760.jpg"},{"uploaded":"\/Date(-62135596800000)\/","thumb":"https://leafly-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/leafly/reviews/waipi-o-hapa_100x100_a5ce.jpg","fullsize":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/cdn/strain-photo/17482/b/waipi-o-hapa_825x550_471c.jpg"}],"photoTotalCount":6,"popularCities":["Portland, ME"],"permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/waipi-o-hapa","starImage":"https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/stars/4.5/240","testGraph":null,"weakDescription":false,"videoUrl":null,"parents":[{"name":"Hawaiian","subtitle":null,"slug":"hawaiian","category":"Sativa","permalink":"https://mobileapi.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian","symbol":"Haw","applink":"leafly://strain/hawaiian"}],"growInfo":{"difficulty":null,"preferredMedium":null,"floweringDays":60,"outdoorFinish":null,"height":null,"averageYield":null,"environment":null,"growNotes":""}}
