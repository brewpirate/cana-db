            "text": "Have you ever wondered what gives strain like Super Lemon Haze, Chernobyl, and Tangie a sweet citrus aroma? That\u2019s limonene, an aromatic cannabis terpene produced in the flower\u2019s resin glands as well as in many everyday items like fruit rinds, cosmetics, and cleaning products. Terpenes are fragrant oils secreted alongside cannabinoids like THC and CBD, and these terpenes not only dictate the smell of marijuana, they can also modify its effects. Some strains tend to express higher levels of the limonene terpene, and oftentimes it\u2019s the sour lemon scent that gives it away. But what\u2019s so special about it?\nLimonene\u2019s Effects and Benefits\nLimonene has a history in medicine, so it should come as no surprise that the limonene found in cannabis offers therapeutic benefits as well. Some of these studied effects include:\n\nElevated mood\nStress relief\nAntifungal properties\nAntibacterial properties\nMay help relieve heartburn and gastric reflux\nImproves absorption of other terpenes and chemicals by way of the skin, mucous membranes, and digestive tract\n\n\nHigh Limonene Cannabis Strains\nWhereas THC levels typically makes up 10 to 20 percent of a flower\u2019s biomass, limonene occurs in more trace amounts \u2013 generally from none at all to 1 to 2 percent. Some strains exhibit higher levels of limonene than others, and these levels can vary widely across harvests depending on the growing and curing process. In other words, one grower\u2019s Jack Herer may test for high levels of limonene while another\u2019s demonstrates a disappointing lack thereof. The only way to know for sure is through lab-tested batches. If your choices are not tested, you can always try following your nose or search our database for citrus-flavored strains.\nHere are some cannabis strains that have the potential to exhibit limonene-rich terpene profiles:\n\nThe presence of limonene is present in both name and aroma with Super Lemon Haze, a sativa strain known for its ability to lift the spirit alongside a sweet lemon flavor.\n\nThe limonene in Durban Poison, a high-energy sativa, isn\u2019t immediately apparent in its subtle sweet and earthy aroma, but you\u2019ll feel its uplifting, stress-relieving effects nonetheless.\n\nYou know how OG strains tend to have that lemony pine aroma? That\u2019s limonene, and it can also be detected in SFV OG\u2019s blissful, stress-crushing sensations.\n\nJack Herer is a fan favorite for a reason: not only does it typically boast high levels of limonene, Jack offers a palette of other terpenes like pinene and myrcene, which promote alertness and relaxation respectively.\n\nLimonene appears most often in sativa strains, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t indica strains with a high limonene potential. Berry White exemplifies this with a limonene content that can be felt in its happy, stress-less effects.",

            "text": "I love this strain. The cross of Whitefire OG with Durban Poison was an excellent idea and produced a wonderful strain.\n\nThis bud has the whole package down. The smell is that of Durban with a sweeter pungent undertone to it and breaking open a bud is almost intoxicating itself. The buds are extremely dense and dusted in white trichomes. It breaks down surprisingly easy for such dense bud; evenly too not clumpy or in balls. It tastes almost like it smells but has a much more sour taste to the exhale.\nThe high is extremely enjoyable and very potent; users beware, this one is strong! My batch is running at 22.66%-26.58% THC, so this one is not recommended for light-weights.\nThe high hits you immediately with effects radiating outward from the chest. An extremely noticable body high quickly develops but it doesn't leave one sedated; instead it offers a racy and uplifting stone (it actually has an actual uplifting feeling to it, like one is floating almost.) The head high is very similar with a buzz in the forehead and racy, jumpy, unfocused thoughts speed through the brain. This is a good one for doing physical activities; tedious, repetitive tasks; or even doing errands/chores. It's not very well suited for general social situations as the high can be very space and/or overwhelming in a  psychedelic manner. It is definitely not recommended for night time use unless one has an EXTREMELY potent and sedative India on hand as well as producing an energetic high is high on this strains list.\n\nOverall I give this strain a 10/10; would recommend to anyone and will definitely be buying again in the future.",
