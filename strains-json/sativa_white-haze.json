            "text": "White Haze is a pretty light smoke. The taste is kinda pine and earthy, with a nice addition of lemon flavor. something I prefer a lot.\n\nAt first comes a nice and warm body-buzz, followed by an euphoric head-high. The mind stays also focused and feels more awake.\n\n\nThe chilled body-buzz together with the focused and happy head-high make it a good Netflix or Chill After Workout - Strain.\nOverall the effects of White Haze are very enjoyable, but there are plenty of other strains which can do at least as good.\n\nMy Rating: 4",
