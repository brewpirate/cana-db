            "text": "White LSD is a very good day-time option. You like a quarter of the energy you would get from Durban, with a subtle onset of euphoria which turns into a span of good \"well-being\" thoughts. It's like a passive anti-depressant which focuses on \"well-being\". You won't just think your doing alright, you will know it because of the increase of creativity. I was having difficulties with bills and stress with bills, but then with this strain the creative problem solving revealed to me the assets and funds I do have and how I could stretch them to make it work! I would have to say White LSD worked for me!!!",
