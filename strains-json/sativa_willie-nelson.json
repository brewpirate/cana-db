            "text": "The official Bob Marley cannabis brand, Marley Natural, will launch its official collection of premium cannabis flowers and oils next week in Washington state, joining an ever-growing group\u00a0of celebrity cannabis companies that are now competing in the market.\nMarley Natural (owned by Privateer Holdings, the parent company of Leafly) came into existence with the blessing of the late reggae pioneer\u2019s surviving family, and is dedicated to preserving the memory of Bob Marley\u2019s Jamaican roots. First selling its products in California, Marley Natural has now made its way up through Oregon and now, beginning on April 10th, the Seattle and Tacoma area in Washington state.\nTwo of Bob\u2019s granddaughters, Zuri and Shacia, attended the launch party at the cannabis dispensary Have a Heart, in downtown Seattle Friday afternoon. Both granddaughters were excited to show off their family\u2019s products, as they exclaimed to customers some of the nuances of the Marley products.\nThe product line that will be offered in Washington includes four categories of cannabis flower, pre-rolls, and oil cartridges. Other available items include body care products and smoking accessories made from sustainably grown American Black Walnut wood and heat-resistant, hand-blown glass.\n[table id=67 /]\nMarley Natural joins several other cannabis businesses owned or endorsed by celebrities that are making strides within the industry. Companies like Willie\u2019s Reserve, Chong\u2019s Choice, and Whoopi & Maya have also recently launched, and expanding cannabis companies are exploring strong ties to celebrities.\nWillie Nelson\u2019s celebrated cannabis brand, Willie\u2019s Reserve, made its debut last July in Washington state cannabis dispensaries before expanding to Colorado. Within a year of its launch, customers can now purchase Willie\u2019s Reserve in four different states, as Oregon and Nevada now supply Willie\u2019s special nugs.\nTommy Chong\u2019s brand Chong\u2019s Choice, which launched its products in February of 2016, has already expanded into six states, including medicinal-only states Montana and Arizona.\nFinally, Whoopi Goldberg\u2019s cannabis company, Whoopi & Maya Medical Cannabis, is also progressing nicely since its launch last year. Goldberg teamed up with Maya Elisabeth, one of the leading \u201ccanna-businesswomen\u201d in the field, to develop a line of products designed to provide relief from menstrual cramps.\nThough Whoopi & Maya has not expanded into any other states outside of California, the company is giving back to the community by advocating the use of its products instead of using painkillers to combat ailments like cramps and headaches.\n\nGiving back to the local communities for these celebrity-owned cannabis brands seems to be helping all parties expand their businesses. As previously stated, Goldberg has been advocating the use of her creams instead of painkillers, while Willie\u2019s Reserve puts a heavy emphasis on using independent local farmers that follow the Farm Aid mission to support environmentally safe growing practices.\nThe same can be said about Marley Natural, as the brand has been giving back to the local communities where its products are being sold. Its Rise Up program, established to support positive social change, environmental sustainability, and empowering local communities harmed by cannabis prohibition, has so far been both successful and rewarding according to Interim Director of Marketing Berrin Noorata.\n\u201cRise Up is our social impact initiative, and what we do is we support programs that are kind of based on Bob\u2019s ideals, such as creating social change and supporting different environmental causes. In every market we go into we give back to that market,\u201d Noorata said. \u201cIn Washington we partnered with the Minority Cannabis Business Association (MCBA) to work on programs to help people beat their cannabis convictions.\u201d\nMarley Natural worked on a similar initiative in Oregon, according to Noorata.\n\n\u201cIn Oregon, we were able to expunge about 30 records. In Washington, they don\u2019t expunge fully, they vacate here,\u201d she told Leafly. \u201cWe are working with people to help [individuals] that have been harmed by cannabis prohibition, so [we think of it as] giving back to the community as legalization is building in the country. We want to help support those people that have been harmed.\u201d\nNoorata said that Marley Natural hopes to launch the Rise Up program in Washington state on April 29.",

            "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Willie Nelson wants his friend Loretta Lynn, who recently revealed that she tried marijuana for the first time at the age of 84 for her glaucoma but didn\u2019t like it, to give cannabis\u00a0a second chance.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a lot of guts,\u201d Nelson said during a recent interview with The Associated Press in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cShe\u2019ll try anything. Maybe I should help her.\u201d\nThe 83-year-old outlaw country icon actually wants to help a lot of people give marijuana a try. He\u2019s attached his name to a line of legal cannabis\u00a0being sold in Colorado and Washington called \u201cWillie\u2019s Reserve,\u201d after decades of personally advocating for legalization.\nThe incoming administration under President-elect Donald Trump has some advocates fearful of a federal crackdown on the states that have legalized cannabis\u00a0for medical or recreational purposes. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has said weed should not be legalized.\n\nBut the \u201cCrazy\u201d songwriter remains hopeful for his latest business venture under the new Trump administration.\n\u201cI think people would be smarter than that,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cYou look and see the benefits. You weigh them against the things that might possibly happen. I think marijuana is probably the safest medicine you can take. These new guys that are coming in there trying to shut it down, I don\u2019t think they will be successful. People will say, \u2018Hey wait a minute. Heroin, cocaine, OK. But it grows in the ground. It seems to be normal. Let it alone.'\u201d\nThe singer-songwriter behind hits such as \u201cOn the Road Again\u201d and \u201cAlways On My Mind\u201d will have a new album out this spring called \u201cGod\u2019s Problem Child,\u201d with his longtime producer Buddy Cannon. The album features a song written by Cannon\u2019s 92-year-old mother and includes some of the last recordings by musician Leon Russell, who died in November.\nBecause Nelson maintains a rigorous touring schedule throughout the year, Nelson and Cannon co-write their songs via text messages.\n\u201cI can come up with a few lines, send them to him and he\u2019ll come up with another one,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThe next thing you know, he\u2019ll go into the studio and put a melody to it and record it and then put his voice on there. Then when I get a chance, I put my voice on there and it seems to be working.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, fans can hear a new song from Nelson in a film he\u2019s starring in called \u201cLost in London LIVE,\u201d directed by and also starring Nelson\u2019s friend, Woody Harrelson. The roughly two-hour film will be shot in multiple locations in London in a single take and will be live-streamed in real time to over 500 movie theaters in the United States on the evening of Jan. 19, the first time a film has been live-streamed to movie theaters as it\u2019s being shot.\nNelson said he\u2019ll be performing the song live during the film.\n\u201cHe has some idea about doing it live,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty ballsy, I think.\u201d",
