            "text": "Last month on March 23, Leafly was fortunate to sponsor Barcelona's first Social Clubs Cannabis Cup. It was an intimate gathering of about 500 attendees and 50 Cup entries, but as we all know, great things have small beginnings. The event itself took place at El Pueblo Espa\u00f1ol (or \"Poble Espanyol\"), a very cool \"village museum\" where each structure in the museum represents a village or town in Spain.\n\nEl Pueblo Espa\u00f1ol in Barcelona.\nThis visually-arresting video recaps the Social Clubs Cannabis Cup event, so if you want to dust off your high school Spanish (or if you're fluent), watch below:\n\nHere are the Social Clubs Cannabis Cup winners broken down into the following categories: Best Indica, Best Sativa, Best Hash, and Best Concentrates. Congratulations to all of the winners! We expect next year's Cup to be an even greater success.\n\u00a0\nTop Indica Cannabis Strains\nFirst Place: K-Lit\u00e9 Social Club with MK Ultra\nSecond Place: C Social Club with La Negra 44\nThird Place: Senzi Club with Critical\n\u00a0\nTop Sativa Cannabis Strains\nFirst Place: Choko Club with Chocolope\nSecond Place: Kush Bcn Club with Amnesia\nThird Place: Resin Club with Diesel Tonic\n\u00a0\nTop Hash\nFirst Place: Roots Club with ice-extraction Amnesia\nSecond Place: Sibaritas with ice-extraction White Widow\nThird Place: Senzi Club with Somali\n\u00a0\nTop Concentrates\nFirst Place: La L\u00ednea Verde with Y Griega shatter\nSecond Place: Padri Club with Tahoe Kush amber glass/shatter\nThird Place: Kush Bcn with Devil Fruit budder\nPoble Espanyol image credit: Wikipedia",
